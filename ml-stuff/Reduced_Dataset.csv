"Who doesn't have a car now days? It seems like everyone is dominated by these four wheeled creation of technology. On the other side, many places and countries in the world have decided to put a stop to the use of cars. This idea of giving up their cars came with many advantages to everyone, some of this benefits are the following. When cars are used less or left completly unused, this helps stop pollution, people feel better, and it improves the economy of car users.

First of all, the most important advantage is that being carfree can stop pollution. One city that had to ban car use for a few days is Paris. Due to all the smug the action that they took is, as stated in the article titled ""Paris bans driving due to smug"", on monday motorists with evennumbered license plates had to leave their car at home and not use it or else they would get a fine of 22 euro, which is equivalent to 31 dollars. And the same thing had to be done for the oddnumbered plates the next day. As the article says ""The smug cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"". This shows how much damage the cars cause in the air, in just a day there was a huge improvement in the amount of smug. It's a demonstration of how much we can help by just taking public transportation and leaving our cars for a while.

In addition, another benefit is that people feel better. The source called ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" has this quote that businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". And it is true that cars can cause drivers a lot of stress, for example, the simple task of driving to work on the mornings can cause stress because we have to be constantly preoccupied of not having an accident or even hitting a pedestrian. In Bogota this measurements has been taken really well by the community and it has worked just fine. Taking stress away is something we are always trying to do but we dont realize how simple it can be if we just used our cars less, they are a cause of this stress after all.

Another advantage is that it improves the economy of the car users. Based on my personal experience, my parents can spend over 80 dollars a week just in buying fuel for our car. Imagine all the money you can save if you didn't have to spend on fuel anymore! Another very expensive thing than comes with the use of cars is that, when it breaks, you're going to have to spend hundreds and even thousands of dollars on the repairs.

To conclude, there are so many benefits we can recieve by limiting our car usage. Three of those are the ones I talked about, it can stop pollution and smug, it can make people feel better, and it can improve our economy.",0
"Not everyone has the luxury of owning a car. But cars are not the only means that can get us from point A to point B. In fact, having limited usage of cars is an advantage to society, our own good, and also the environment. In the twentyfirst century, it may seem that possessing a car is a vital aspect of living, however, that is not always the case.

To began with, having a limited amount of cars on the roads means a less amount of car emission that stays in the air. Carbon emissions from cars are responsible from around 50% of the greenhouse gases in the United States alone Source 1. If we were to limit our car usage, it is very likely for that percentage to go down. Taking the account that cars are the second most item that pollutes the air, it would be a dramatic change for the environment to be a cleaner and heathier place to live Source 4.

Additionally, if we were to use our cars less and relied on public transportation, we would be able to help the economy. Using individual cars does not help anyone economically. In the other had, riding subways, buses, taxis, and other public transportation will allow the public economy to rise, which in turn allows the government to receive extra money that could benefit the local city. Taking the decision to not use cars promotes alternative ways to get to the final destination in mind Source 3. It also lets parks to be used more often than before and sidewalks become wider and safer. Moreover, the less cars that are on the street, the less traffic jams, car crashes, and time that is wasted sitting in a car wishing to be somewhere else Source 3.

furthermore, if more people were to walk or bike on the side walks, they would be able to enjoy the natural nature that they cannot fully appreciate when they are zooming pass it in their cars at fifty miles per hour. Also, getting the chance to actaully look at what the local city has to offer helps little businesses to become successful. Not using cars can also be included in our daily excersise that we are all supposed to be doing. Instead of being lazy and using cars to take us to places, we can all use that extra mile or so to help improve our health. Getting out in the open and getting some fresh air will also be beneficial to one's health by alleviating them from bad thoughts and ""it is a good opportunity to take away stress"" Source 3. Getting away from the busy life that includes cars is extremely advantageous to humans' health and the city they live in.

Much has changed throughout history. Nothing ever stays the same, so maybe it's the time to change the amount of car usage. This era is a time period where there are many technological inovations that allow humans from all across the world to stay in touch without leaving their couch. There has been a noticeable decrease in the amount of miles that have been driven since 2005 Source 4. This is a positive step foward to a better future for the generations to come for less cars on the road means there wil be less pollutions entering the atomsphere, more opportunities for businesses, and incouraging individuals to make healthier choices.",0
"The Electoral College is a process made by the founding fathers for the election of presidents by the congress vote. The Electoral College is a process, but it is an unfair process. Americans are supposed to vote for who they desire to be president, not a group of electors in Congress. There is no possible way for Americans to choose their president if at the end of it all, a group of electors make the final choice. According to the Office of the Federal Register, Americans choose the state electors when voting for President because when voting for president, Americans are actually voting for the candidate's electors. It makes no sense then to vote for a president, let's just make it to where we vote for electors because we obviously aren't voting for who we want as president.

The main purpose of voting is to help the candidate American voters want as president to win the election. If popular vote was the way to determine who would be elected as President, everybody would be happy. There are times in an election when everybody is sure that the candidate they voted for is going to win. Americans watch as they see the votes go up by popular vote, but then later, the candidate they thought would win has lost because of the Electoral College. If popular vote was the way Presidents were elected, everything would be made easier without controversy. However, since the Electoral College does play a big role in the election of presidents, popular vote is never going to be a working system. Americans just need to figure out that their vote is never going to really count, but the Electoral College's vote surely will.

In an article by Bradford Plumer, the fact that over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than how we vote now is stated. The Electoral College System is based on Americans voting for the electors that are the candidate's party. When Americans go to vote, they vote for electors who support the President and then the electors choose the president. When Americans go to vote, the banners should just say Vote For Electors. When Americans vote, it is made to seem as they are voting directly for the President they want to be elected. Instead, Americans are actually voting for electors. Multiple times you'll hear the saying, ""Every vote counts."" but really, every vote does not count. No matter how many times Americans vote for their President, the Electoral College has the final say no matter what American's votes are.

The major problem that worries many, is the problem of a tie in the electoral vote. During an election when a tie occurs, the state delegations vote for who will be president. According to the article The Indefensible Electoral College by Bradford Plumer, each state is able to cast one vote and the one single state representative makes the decision for the state. If the point of an election is for the people to vote and choose, there shouldn't even be a option for the one representative to choose. All the votes that were just cast by Americans all go down the drain now. In the case of a tie, all the power and weight goes to the one state representative to choose who becomes the president. The represtative does not care about what the people want, that representative will choose what they want to do with this election. According to Bradford Plummer, during the 2000 campaign, Rhode Island, South Carolina and fifteen other states did not even get to view media markets or campaigns and did not even get to see the candidates. Those states howeve still voted, not knowing anything about these candidates because overall the Electoral College makes the last call.

The Electoral College is an unfair process that also plays a big role in elections. No matter how Americans vote, the Electoral College is going to be the people who elect the president. Americans vote for who they want as their president but the Electoral College simply makes that decision for you. Americans shouldn't even vote, the Electoral College can make that decision. Many people in America simply want the popular vote than to have the process of Electoral College in place. We should all take a vote to abolish the Electoral College. But wait, the Electoral College might say no since they always make the overall decision.",0
"People use cars everyday, but limiting car usage can be very beneficial. There are many advantages when limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can clear smog, reduce traffic, and it make people less stressed. Many people use cars, but that number has decreased over the last few years. There are many other ways to get to a place rather than using cars. We are now open to many options of transportation. Cars can be used, but there should be limits.

Limiting car usage can clear pollution, particularly smog. For example,""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middleclass families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions rom tailpipe""Rosenthal. Cars are an impediment to the efforts of trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With the limiting of car usage, those greenhouse gas emissions can surely decrease a lot. It will make the air healthier for people to live, and for future generations. Smog and greenhouse gas emissions can reduce greatly if cars have limited usage.

Not using cars can make people happy,less stressed out, and relieved of tension. People don't have to worry about their cars, and paying for gas and other things when they don't use their cars. For instance,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""Rosenthal. A woman is saying he is happier when he doesn't use his car. Another example is ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""Selsky. Both of those claims are very true. It does take away stress for him, while it reduces pollution. That's a winwin. With less stress and tension, people will be happier in their lives and there might be less problems in society. Limiting car usage can have really great impacts on people's happiness.

Reducing the usage of cars can also reduce traffic, making it easier for other people that use cars. In France,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital""Duffer. 60 percent is a big amount of traffic. I'm pretty sure that that would satisfy alot of people. No traffic means less accidents, and less people worried about being late to school or work. Only a crazy person would actually want to be in traffic. There would also be less noise of cars, and more peaceful sounds. Limiting the usage of cars can guarantee the satisfaction of people that normally go through traffic, and those who don't like it.

There are many reasons to limit the usage of cars because there are so many advantages. People will be less stressed and more happy, there will be less traffic, and the air will be less polluted with smog and greenhouse gas emissions. The possibilites are endless. It is very simple less cars, more benefits. People need to realize that having cars may have some benefits when trying to get somewhere, but it makes more sense not to because there are so many advantages. Limited car usage can benefit people in many ways.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of either maintaining the current system or changing to a popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that both options have their merits, but ultimately, the Electoral College provides a fair and practical method for electing the president.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the purpose of the Electoral College. As explained by the Office of the Federal Register, the Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens. This process consists of the selection of electors, their vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

One of the main arguments for the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all system in most states. This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College reflects their share of the popular vote. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to disputes, as seen in the 2000 election when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the quirks of the Electoral College.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes trans-regional appeal for presidential candidates. Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This prevents the residents of certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the elected president considers the interests of all regions.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are crucial in deciding the outcome of the election. This leads to more informed and engaged voters who carefully consider the candidates' positions and policies. In contrast, a popular vote system would focus candidates' efforts on densely populated areas, neglecting the interests and concerns of voters in less populous states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states against the mal-apportionment of smaller states in the Senate. By allocating electoral votes based on population, larger states receive more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are addressed. This is particularly important in maintaining a political balance among states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, as it invariably produces a clear winner. This prevents the complications and uncertainties associated with elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, such as the need for additional rounds of voting or runoffs.

While it is true that the winner-take-all system can make voters in states with a strong political leaning less likely to participate in the election, this does not justify dismantling the Electoral College. As Judge Posner points out, approximately half of the eligible American population still chooses to vote, even when their state's electoral votes are predetermined.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, though not perfect, provides a fair and efficient method for electing the President of the United States. It ensures the certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. While a direct popular vote may seem more democratic in theory, it overlooks the practical benefits that the Electoral College offers. I believe that it is in the best interest of our nation to maintain the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider these points when deciding on the issue of the Electoral College. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Cars are creating an harmful environment with problems such as smog and traffic. Reduction on car usage can help these problems. Although cars may be a faster transportation, they add on to the havoc of the environment. Reducing car usage has many advantages. It would help develop a better environment and improve people's well being.

An advantage of reduction of car usage is it helps develop a better environment to live in. Some areas which have cars create a lot of smog which is unhealthy for the environment. For example, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Duffer. Smog is formed by cold nights and warm days which causes the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Without so many cars, this issue can decrease. It will help the environment progress and be safer for everyone. Statistics show that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal. Cars are causing air pollution. If cars are still the dominant transportation, the environment will still suffer from air pollution such as smog. It's safer to use a large vehicle such as a bus to get around because a bus can hold many more people than a car and would ultimately give off less gas than the population of people who use cars. Another safe way around town would be vehicles which don't give off gases into the air such as bicycles. A safer environment is a better environment.

Another advantage of reduction of cars is improvement of people's well being. With air pollution from cars, humans inhale toxic gases which can be detrimental to their bodies. If car usage plunders, people's bodies will feel better. A businessman said ""It's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Plaza. Lowering the number of cars being used helps relieve stress. Nobody wants to be stressed out from traffic or being late to work. With cars there is always a place where there is traffic. Ultimately, reduction of car usage has numerous effects that benefit the society. A media trainer and mother of two stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Walter. Without a car, you don't have to worry about being severely injured since most of the population would transfer to the use of bikes or walking. Because the population would start a trend of riding bikes and walking, most of the roadways would now be unecessary to have and they could be built into something fundamental such as a park, a housing area, or a food market. There would be less worries altogether and this could be more beneficial to the society.

There are many positive effects from reducing car usage. Environment will progress and people's well being will improve. It's beneficial for everyone to limit the use of cars and find other transportation. There would be a safer environment from less smog and rushhour restrictions. Also, the environment will be peoplefriendly from more parks and sports centers. Limiting car usage effects society positively.",0
"Dear Mr. State Senator, I have been a citizen of the United States for my entire life, and through my studies, research, and personal experiences with the Electoral College system, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral college system is not only an out of date way of casting a vote, but also an ineffective way of electing a president. I believe that the popular vote both directly reflects and accurately shows which politician citizens have chosen will best lead our country. The Electoral College is merely a way for politicians to attempt to swing the vote in their favor by paying more attention to states that contain more electors. Politicians should be concerned about gaining the votes of individuals, regardless of how many Electoral College members their states contain.

There is very little need for the electoral college even to exist at all. There is absolutely no point in having two ways for collecting the votes of citizens when all that the system requires is for one of the candidates to gather more votes than the other. Having the Electoral College does not help the voting process and therefore will only harm or make the process of electing a president ineffective. In many cases, the votes of the Electoral College go against what the popular votes want and tend to cause an unwanted politician to go into office. I am not the only citizen concerned about this system, there are people all across the United States who dislike the Electoral College and who see that it constantly gets in the way of electing a decent president into office.

There have been politicians, Chamber of Commerce members, and everyday citizens who have stood up against this awefull Electoral College and who have realized just how terrible and ineffective it is. Putting this system out of commission will be no easy task, but if enough citizens like myself write to their local, state, and federal congress members, change just might be possible. Though a group effort would be required to destroy this system, it would be extremely difficult to convince politicians and presidents that have been in office for years to destroy this College that allowed for them to go into office. It would also be exceptionally difficult to get all three branches of the United States government to destroy the Electoral College, adderall.. it would only take the president's veto to stop it from being removed.

There are counter claims to mine that I'm sure you will recieve within your time in office, counter claims that you should'nt ignore. I think that you should look over all of the evidence, all of the facts, and all of the sources that you can inorder to form your opinion as to whether or not the Electoral College should stay, or it should be terminated. Some of the claims that you will recieve will not have much basis and will most likely state that the system has been in existence ever since the founding of the United States. These claims are not based on evidence of the system being correct or being fair, these calims are based on a fear of change. Change tends to scare people, especially when their power of voting may be altered due to a major change to the U.S. government. But over the past several decades alone, our country has undergone many wonderful changes and experiences that have positively affected its citizens and its laws.

Two of these changes include the desegregating of schools and the right for women to vote. These changes are extremely positive, just like the destroying of the Electoral College would be. It would have a positive impact on all of the country's citizens and would allow for the United States to show that it too can change and adapt for the better.

I am not writing this letter to you because i think that you can single handidly change the voting system of the United States, I am writing this letter to you because I have faith that you can help change the opinion of your fellow politicians and State leaders. I hope that you use the facts and research that I have presented to you today and continue to gather more evidence on the Electoral College system and why it is holding back our country from properly electing its presidents.

Thank you very much for both your time and your consideration, I wish you luck on changing the system and informing others about the problem.",0
"Dear Florida senator, this letter is to discuss my opinion about the voting system for how the new president of the United States of America should be elected or for how the current president should serve another term. The main topic for this letter, is wether or not we should keep the Electoral College or disregard it and go to popular vote. Giving this topic into consideration, it should be best if we switch to popular vote. Candidates not focusing their attention on all the states and that the outcome could be a tie are the different aspects on why we should abolish Electoral College and bring forth popular vote.

To begin with, candidates don't focus on trying to get all the states to vote on them in Electoral College. The explanation for this is because since its the ""winnertakeall"" system, the competitors disregard the states where they know they're not going to win over the majority. They don't even show up to the states or try to win them over. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"" quoted from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. Some might say that this is not a huge issue, but it is to the states that are being ignored. They want equality and a chance to be recognized by each of the rivals. It is clear to see that the candidates give no sign of importance to states that have slim chances of them voting for himher.

Continuing on further, the Electoral College's outcome could end up in a tie. In a result of this mishap, the state delegates, from the House of Representatives, start to vote for the president. The vicepresident is chosen by the The Senate. Each state has one vote to choose which side their rooting for. The silver lining in this decision is that, different states have different amount of population, so it's unfair for all the states to have the same amount of power in choosing the president. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" taken from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. People doubt that there will ever be a tie but they're were close ones in 1968 and 1976. There's no doubt that, if a tie happens in the Electoral College, everything would go down south.

To sum it all up, reasons why we should switch out of Electoral College is because candidates don't focus on every state and that the final outcome might end up to be a tie. The Electoral College should be abolished due to these reasons. Popular vote is the best for our country. It'll help the voting system by an abundant amount. Please take this into consideration senator and make the correct decision.",0
"Cars have been popular and widely used ever since they were invented. They offer a fast and efficient form of transportation across both long and short distances. In this aspect, cars may appear extremely beneficiary and useful in everyday life, but there are always downsides to great inventions, especially the invention of the car. More and more people from all around the world are realizing the harms that car usage brings and are beginning to abandon their cars altogether. The most apparent reason as to why cars are damaging is because of the great amount of greenhouses gases they emit into the atmosphere. They also bring about pollution and smog with them. Finally, and maybe surprisingly to some, people are actually happier without these pollution monsters.

To start, cars expel shocking amounts of greenhouses gases from their tailpipe. By limiting usage of these automobiles, the amount of green house gases can be significantly reduced. According to the source, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, cars produce up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in places like Europe, but an eyepopping 50 percent in the United States where there is heavy car usage. This is a lot of noxious gas that is being put into the atmosphere, and poses a serious harm to the people living in these cities. Greenhouse gases are an especially maleficent form of pollution because greenhouse gases tend to trap heat and other types of pollution from escaping the atmosphere, leaving filth in the air that are then absorbed by the lungs, ""choking cities Rosenthal 8."" This is without a doubt a serious problem, but it can be corrected simply by not driving as frequently. According to The End of Car Culture, ""But America's love affair with it vehicles seems to be cooling...If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants Rosenthal 3234."" Simply by reducing car usage, these harmful toxins can be removed from the atmosphere.

Pollution is another quite obvious reason to why restricting car usage is beneficial. Cars release other toxins and gases as well that contribute greatly to pollution and smog.

Paris bans driving due to smog tells the story of how driving had to be banned for days because of the worst pollution the city has ever seen. According to this passage, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 144 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found Duffer 1417."" This is a ton of particulate matter that will be all breathed in by the people there if they are not removed. Paris, Brussels, and London are not only the cities plagued by this pollution from cars as ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world Duffer 14."" Smog from pollution negatively effects many aspects of life, but the worst was that ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions Duffer 14."" This phenomenon forces the people to breathe these particles into their lungs. Pollution is a terrible occurence that tags along with car usage, but by simply banning cars with evennumbered licnese plates off the road for one day, the smog greatly lightened in severity, enough for the city of Paris to lift the ban. No one wants pollution in their city, and simply by cutting back on car usage, pollution can be greatly reduced for the benefit of the people.

Finally, and most surprisingly, people are actually happier and less stressed without these modern horses. Heidrum Walter, a mother who lives in the city of Vauban Germany, a community devoid of cars, says in the passage, Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , ""'When I had a car I was tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal 3.'"" Carlos Arturo Plaza, a man in Bogota, Colombia, also commented during Bogota's Day Without Cars, in the source, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution Selsky 24.'"" This may seen a little puzzling at first as to why people would not enjoy fast and convenient transportation, but then the answer becomes pretty obvious. Without cars, parks, sport centers, and other outdoor recreational places have started to pop up more amd more on the streets of cities once bustling with cars. The roads are much less congested and new shops and food centers have appeared as well. Limiting cars pleases people in many different aspects of their life.

Cars may appear to be helpful at times, but in reality, citizens are better off without these transportation machines. Not only do they greatly pollute the air and cause smog, they also spew out noxious greenhouse gases that cause more damage to the society as a whole. Finally, and probably most importantly, the citizens themselves enjoy life better when these cars are out of them. Although this doesn't mean cars should stop being manufactored altogether, people should think twice before jumping in their car next time.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities is gaining traction around the world. As highlighted in the passages, there are several advantages to this approach. Limiting car usage not only helps to reduce air pollution, but also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles. Additionally, it can lead to a more connected and accessible community.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, and the numbers can be even higher in certain areas in the United States. By moving away from car-dependent lifestyles, communities can greatly contribute to reducing their carbon footprint and mitigating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a driving ban highlights how severe smog can be in cities heavily reliant on cars. By reducing the number of vehicles on the road, especially those running on diesel fuel, communities can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the health of their residents.

Limiting car usage also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, demonstrates how people can benefit from not relying on cars for transportation. Walking or cycling instead of driving leads to increased physical activity, which has numerous health benefits. It also reduces the sedentary behavior associated with car commuting, which can contribute to various health problems.

In addition to health benefits, limiting car usage can create more connected and accessible communities. By adopting a ""smart planning"" approach, as seen in Vauban, neighborhoods can be designed with amenities within walking or biking distance. This means that stores, restaurants, and other services are placed on main streets, making them easily accessible without the need for a car. This approach fosters a sense of community and promotes social interaction.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, leading to a cleaner and more sustainable environment. Additionally, it promotes healthier and more active lifestyles and creates connected and accessible communities. As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change and the need for sustainable living, limiting car usage is a viable solution that can have a positive impact on both individuals and communities.",1
"The founding fathers established the Electoral College in order to compromise between elections of the President and vice president. This process has help us to elect great presidents in which changed and make our Americas history. The Electoral College is a great process in which we should keep doing it. I favor in keeping the Electoral College because it is a faster and reliable way of electing the president. For instinct, "" The Electoral College process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.""Source 1 All the 538 electors that is part of the Electoral College represents millions of people. In order to count all the vote takes a long time so, the Electoral College is a faster way of electing the president.

The Electoral College has a certainty of outcome for who is going to be the president and vice president. But, the electoral college has an invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. What that means is that, if the popular votes get 55% of your votes but, the electoral college get 62% of your votes. The votes from the popular votes and the electoral votes have different percentage. For this problem you cant really predict what the Electoral College will elect.

The electoral college in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Because of these states like Texas, Florida, California, New York, and other states that have large amounts of Electoral College they are more likely to vote knowing that their votes are more important because of the winnertakeall method. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.""Source3 This explains that the electoral college is a process that is relivent in keeping some power to the people.

The bad the thing about the electoral college is that the people dont vote for the president , but they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This process is not always fair because if you live in florida and you wanted to elect James but slate of 29 Democratic electors pledge to Don, so that means none republican electors pledge to James. This means your vote dont really effect the election. This problem is argued and complained with many people. The problem of a tie could happen too but the probility of that happening is not likely.

Overall, the electoral college is process that is fair in most terms. It is a fast and reliable way in which I personially insist and favor of keep doing because the electoral college has help people to reconized the importants of people views and making people reconized how important it is to vote for their government.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for the environment. The passages provided highlight the benefits of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days, all of which contribute to a more sustainable and efficient future.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.

Car-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, offer a model for a more sustainable way of living. These communities prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, and discourage car ownership. The passage states that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have experienced improved quality of life and reduced stress levels without cars. This suggests that limiting car usage can lead to a more peaceful and enjoyable community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passages highlight how driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris, can significantly reduce congestion. In Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent after the ban was enforced. This reduction in traffic congestion not only improves air quality but also saves time for commuters. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation becomes more efficient, allowing for faster travel times and a smoother flow of traffic.

In addition to these benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active communities. Car-free days, such as the one in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transportation. These alternative modes of transportation promote physical activity, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The passage mentions how millions of Colombians participated in the car-free day and left the streets devoid of traffic jams. This shows that there is a willingness among people to embrace alternative modes of transportation and prioritize their health.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved quality of life, reduced traffic congestion, and healthier communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success and feasibility of implementing car-free initiatives. As a society, it is important to prioritize sustainable transportation options and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.",1
"Abolishing the Electoral College sounds like an excellent idea. The election by popular vote is most definetely without a doubt, more fair for the people. Why are 538 people the ones who get to decide who becomes president and not the rest of us? The Electoral College is outdated and too old for today society. Lets get rid of this while we can.

The Electoral College was made many years ago by the founding fathers, this can tell you it is outdated. People used to have completely different political views back then, we need a fresh start on how we want it today because things have changed. We the people should vote on what we want now an Electoral College as. a popular vote by the people and decide since it has been over a thousand years later.

""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" says Bradford Plumer in source two. Plumer is right about this, the electoral college is very unfair. How can 538 people decide what happens for the rest of us? It should not be like this, everyone should be equal and all vote then go with the most popular vote for the president. We need to change our ways now before the next election.

Some people may argue like Richard Posner in source three that ""the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.."", basically saying the electoral college makes things more equal and fair. What is not fair is that everyone doesn't get to vote directly only the electors do. Many people don't agree with Posner and they shouldn't because the electoral college is the wrong way to run things.

Lets make changes to our future, and abolish the Electoral college. We need to have an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Fairness and equality is the route we need to take.",0
"Is there any advantages of limiting car usage? Whether it's for the environment or even your health, there are some advantages that overall can help you. Lets be honest, cars aren't cheap and i don't really see them getting any cheaper but walking from point A to point B is free. It's kind of like killing two birds with one stone, by walking you save the environment from the gas you would be burning and you're saving money at the same time.

Limiting or even completly getting rid of driving can help you become a happier or even tense free person. Driving a vehicle, especially on a congested highway or road can create road rage causing you to become more stressful and aggravated. In a suburb in Germany, residents there are giving up their cars, something they have never done before. They seem to be working efficiently without their cars, still being able to go to the store and work. It seems that they like this way of life better, stress free and no worry of getting stuck in traffic. Like what Heidrun Walter explained in source one, she said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" People are so infatuated with the thought of driving and cars but they don't realize that driving all the time is effecting your health. Personally, I think it's some of the reason as to why there is so much obesity in this world.

Not only is driving all the time bad for your health but it's also bad for the environment. Paris had a problem with there being so much smog, that they actually had to enforce a partial ban from driving. The partial ban was working, it was said in source 2 that after five days of intensifying smog, congestion went down 60 percent in the capitol of France. The partial ban worked with trying to clear out the smog to help the environment so well that the French party rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on tuesday's. Source 3 explained that in Columbia they were going on there third year of cars being banned except for buses and taxis. Just like in Germany people seemed to being adjusting and liking the idea of no cars on the roadway. A business man named Carlos Arturo Plaza, said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" referring to Columbias third year of banning cars.

Even if you just have to go right down the street, people hop in there cars and go, when in fact you can just walk. An official of Transportation for America,David Goldberg, expressed about how depended we are on vehicles. He said ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" And change is what seems to be exactly happening. In source 4 it was said that there seemed to be a decline in America's love affair with their vehicles. According to Doug Short, who is apart of an investment research comapany said that ""When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter."" Maybe people are starting to realize that you don't necessarily need to drive and that it's more of previlge then a must.",0
"Imagine being stuck in traffic again for the fifth time this week. You glance at the time and you see that you're running late for work again. Cars can cause lot of problems like for example, people get into many car crashes that kill many innocent children or bystanders, the traffic jams always take hours to clear up, and the exhaust in the tail pipe is polluting the air. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air.

Although cars may come in handy they can be a real pain to have. Like for instance paying car insurance every month, paying for gas, and paying for your car if anything breaks and needs a new part If the car usage was limited there will be more people on bikes and walking. This is good for the residents because they are spending less money and they are getting excersise from this. In Vauban, Germany the residents there have given up their cars. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars Rosenthal, 3. There only transportation there is a tram that runs though Freiburg Rosenthal, 2. This helps residents there get to place to place easier.

Also with the car limitations there will be a whole lot less traffic on the roads. For example in Paris, France they made even numbered license plates residents leave their cars at home, then the next day odd numbered license plate residents Duffer, 11. Even though they tried to ban the cars there were 40,000 drivers fined due to driving their cars Duffer, 12. Also when this rule was put into place there was less traffic in the capital of France. The traffic went down by 60% Duffer, 14.

Most importantly there will be less pollution in the air. Residents in cars dont really know how much pollution is put into the air when they drive. The exhaust from the tail pipe of a car is causing a huge defect in this earth's greenhouse effect. In france the pollution was so bad there was smog in the air from all the cars Duffer, 14. The smog in France was as bad as the world's most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China Duffer, 14. Also in Bogota, Colombia there was really bad smog, but after the car limitation there was a huge decrease in the smog Selsky, 21.

In conclusion, there are many advantages in car limitation. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air. With less cars this will help our earth big time because the greenhouse effect will stop getting car exhaust pumped through there. Also we may fine alternate ways to replace gas and oil to make this world healthier.",0
"I dont think that the electoral college should decide the president of the united states, i think that the overall vote of the americans should determine the president of the unites states. I have certain reasons, and a good explanation of why the popular vote matters way more than the electoral vote first is why would they even have a popular vote if there not gonna go by it? Also the popular vote has mostly everyone in the united states voting on it, the electoral vote has only a couple people, they are way outnumbered. And lastly its not fair at all to the american people.

Firstly, why would you want the whole united states of america to vote on something if what they vote, and what they say isnt being heard. Whats the point of it? in my opinion what the people say how the president should be determined. If they want it any other way why would they not have changed it by now? no one really likes having to take time out of there day to go vote, if there votes arnt even going to be seen, or heard by people? whats the point of making them do that?

Secondly, the united states has billions of people in it, and the electoral college only has a few people in it. You think thats very fair to anybody ??? everyone votes, results are in, you think you have a winner, then all of a sudden theres no winner, you know why? because of the electoral college!!! these extra people make the final decision and thats not right. If thats the case of it to me it seems like they have the answers, and no one can decide but them, so why even have a vote? its really pointless the author states that most states like the idea that the overall vote wins, theres only a couple that dont like this idea. So by rule they should just make it the popular vote wins the election, and thats who tthe president becomes. Why they havnt done it? I have no idea!

And my final reason of why popular votes should just determine who wins is because they go out and vote and they feel like it doesnt matter. Because the electoral college decides then the united states gets really mad when they vote and the popular vote doesnt win! Of course they get mad, who wouldnt? there votes mean nothing at all. And they need to change this electoral college policy, more people want it gone thaen the people that dont. And thats mostly why america is usually never satisfied with the president of the unites states. Because of the fact that the united states didnt put them and the votes first, they put the electoral college ahead and thats not how it needs to be!!! They should make a vote for the united states saying that who wants to keep the electoral college and who doesnt! i bet that they will say that they want it gone. Because its already been voted out before so why will they keep something that no one is satisfied, or pleased with? Hopefully they will see this soon enough!!!

In conclusion, this electoral college stuff just needs to go, and the people need to be happy with there vote that they want, and they should be! they have been living in the state there whole life, if not most of it. And they want to make sure that someone they like, and know and trust will be there leader and wont let them down, and will change the problems that are in america. So go ahead and keep the electoral college even if barely any one likes it. Cause that doesnt make any sesnse!!!! the people need to vote on there counties leader not a few people for each state, and or place. its not right, and no one really likes it.",0
"Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for both individuals and communities. The passages provided highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation. By implementing policies and initiatives to encourage car-free living, cities and suburbs can create more livable and sustainable environments.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the first passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a significant contribution to climate change and air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help combat these issues and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog illustrates how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. Cold nights and warm days can trap car emissions, resulting in smog that affects the health of residents. Implementing car-free initiatives can help reduce this pollution and create cleaner and healthier environments for individuals to live in.

Limiting car usage also encourages the use of public transportation and alternative modes of transportation such as biking and walking. The third passage discusses the successful car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a healthier lifestyle and decreases the reliance on cars. By prioritizing public transportation and creating pedestrian-friendly cities, we can improve accessibility for everyone and reduce the need for car ownership.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive effects on urban planning and the design of suburbs. The second passage describes the district of Vauban in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but there are limited parking spaces available. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own a car. This approach encourages walking and cycling by placing stores within walking distance and creating compact communities. By reimagining the design of suburbs and prioritizing accessibility to public transportation and amenities, we can create more sustainable and livable communities.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable environments. Implementing car-free initiatives and prioritizing public transportation can lead to healthier and more accessible communities. It is important for individuals and governments to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a future with reduced car dependency.",1
"Many elections have passed throughout the years. When its time to vote people go out crazy just to cast in their vote. They are hoping that the candidate they selected gets nominated and win. The Electoral College is a method to elect presidents which in some way its a good thing. The way i see it its not, so i claim to change the way presidents are elected by changing to election by popular vote rather than the Electoral College because it is unfair. Also, its not really you who is being a part of which president you chose to win. Last of all, its a waste of time.

To start off the Electoral College should be replaced with election by popular vote because it is unfair for the most part. The Electoral College has its good part which states in source 3, paragraph 22 "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep your despised method of choosing president"" "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" It shows how it helps with the majority votes. Yet it is more unfair as it states in source 2 paragraph 12 ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, he election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote the president."" This shows how if there is ever a tie then really your vote doesnt count since someone else has to end up deciding who to elect for president.

If we were to elect presidents by popular vote then it would be more fair since we are electing them with our votes.

Following how the Electoral College is unfair, it also shows how we really dont elect the president. In source 2 paragraph 10 it states ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This shows how our votes go to their electors rather than us electing the president. That is not a good way to count our votes because you never know if the elector is in favor or not with their candidate. Also, the electors could be anyone as it says in source 2 paragraph 10 "" They can be anyone not holding public office."" We never know if the electors are reliable and it can affect some people since they voted for that specific candidate to be president and they didnt get enough votes when in reality its between their electors and states. It just shows how in reality our votes dont really have a say and count in the way where we don't elect the president.

Not only is the Electoral College unfair and it really doesn't let us elect the president, it also is a waste of time. It's good how the Electoral College has steps and takes time to go through the motions of how many votes and who does the electors vote for and all, but it takes a whole lot time for nothing really. The election is really not with our votes, but between the state, House of Representative , and their electors. It just waste time as in source 2 paragraph 12 it says "" Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. where state delegations vote on the president. The Senate would choose the vice president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming. representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" This shows how it takes a long time within just them when we just waste our tim with voting since they would have the last word.

In conclusion, I claim on changing to election by popular vote than keeping the Electoral College because it is unfair. You arent really the one choosing the president, you are choosing their electors. At the end of the day its a waste of time for us to vote and to go through all those steps with the Electoral College and wait to see who gets elected. The Electoral College in a way shows how our vote doesnt really have a say and count directly towards the president. It is much better if the election would be by popular vote since it is us electing and we know who we voted and all. This way it let's us speak through our votes.",0
"The Electoral Collage has been around for a long time. Every few years, voters go to vote on election day and their vote can either mean everything or nothing. There are many flaws with the Electoral Collage: it serves an outdated purpose, popular vote does not matter, and there is the possibility of the disaster factor. Using the Electoral Collage could lead to undesired consequences.

Back in the times in which the Electoral Collage was founded, commutation between the colonies was not quick. News could take months to arrive, and with the Electoral Collage, if news about a presidential candidate came out that made him a threat, for example if he was a murderer, the electors would know that and, despite what the voters thought, not to vote for him. In the current times, as soon as something had happened that would make a candidate look bad, it would not be very long before such news would be on T.V., social media Facebook, Twitter, etc.,and on the radio. So unless someone wasn't paying much attention, every vote should be valid.

With the Electoral Collage system, the vote of an individual does not matter. Whether three people in a state vote or threemillion vote, as long as a majority only 51% of the votes vote for the candidate, that candidate gets all the electoral votes for that state. If only 51% of people vote for a candidate he wins that state, that leaves 49% of people in that state whose votes are now discredited. Eventually, like in some cases such as the election in 2000, it can add up that a candidate wins the popular vote, the actual majority, but not the election. So despite the wishes of the majority, the other candidate in this situation would win.

When a candidate wins all the electoral votes for a state, those votes are sent to electors so that they can vote on behalf of the people, or not. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy.""""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer Not only an incident such as this could occur, but electors of two slates could be sent to congress and chose not to vote as asked. With all these flaws, why are we still using the Electoral Collage?

The Electoral Collage no longer serves the purpose it once did, and it is now doing more harm than good. Back when it was established, it did what was needed for the time. This is a new era, it's time for a new system.",0

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent of [State], I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. While there are valid arguments for both sides, I believe that the Electoral College system is essential for maintaining fair and balanced elections in our great nation, ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard and protecting the interests of smaller states.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation. This system ensures that each state has a fair representation in the presidential election, preventing larger states from overpowering smaller ones.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. By having electors vote for the President, rather than a direct popular vote, we avoid the risk of disputed outcomes. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, allowing for a more decisive result. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to recounts and potential disputes, as seen in the 2000 election. The Electoral College minimizes the chance of such scenarios and provides a clear winner.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's president. Candidates need to have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on support from one region. This prevents presidents from neglecting the interests and concerns of certain regions, as they would be representing all states and not just the ones they won in the popular vote. By requiring candidates to seek votes from across the country, the Electoral College promotes better representation and a broader understanding of the diverse needs of our communities.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is its encouragement of campaign focus in swing states. Candidates dedicate their resources and efforts to states where the election outcome is uncertain. This ensures that the needs and concerns of these diverse states are addressed, as swing states are more likely to receive attention from candidates. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus solely on highly populated areas and ignore the smaller states, effectively silencing the voices of millions of Americans in less populated regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate already grants smaller states equal representation, and the Electoral College complements this by giving each state a minimum of three electors. This ensures that larger states do not completely dominate the election process, preserving the interests and influence of smaller states. It acts as a check to prevent the tyranny of the majority, ensuring that all states have a say in the election of our President.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. It provides a clear winner, preventing complicated and potentially lengthy run-off elections that could further extend the already long presidential election process. By streamlining the election process, the Electoral College allows for a more efficient selection of our President.

In conclusion, Senator, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system. It guarantees fair representation for all states, encourages trans-regional appeal in candidates, protects the interests of smaller states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While there are rightful criticisms surrounding this system, it is important to consider the practical advantages it offers. I urge you to keep the Electoral College intact and protect the interests of our great nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my viewpoint and make decisions that benefit the welfare of our state and country as a whole. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this issue in more detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"As we should know, ""the Electoral College is a process not an actual place. It serves as a compromise of the presidential election in Congress and by popular vote"" paragraph 1. It can be good at times but most times it has its downfall. The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. Also, there isn't a fair number of votes for each presidential candidate per state. If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster. I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall?

First of all, the Electoral college isn't a direct election. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Paragraph 10. In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of malapportionment"", paragraph 21 voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itself.

It's not only an indirect election but it's also an unfair election. The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. ""One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators."" paragraph 3. This is unfair because the number of ""House"" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who believe their votes doesn't count because of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor.

Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives"" paragraph 12. This is an unfair method also because now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause controversy in the public. ""The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued"" patagraph 22 but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the ""most thoughtful voters"".

All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfall. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" paragraph 14 and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The passage set provides examples from various parts of the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing reliance on cars.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly reduced. Vauban, a town in Germany, serves as an excellent example of this. With the majority of families not owning cars, the streets are car-free, resulting in a substantial decrease in emissions. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent.

Limiting car usage also has health benefits. Cars contribute to air pollution, which can have adverse effects on human health. The smog in Paris, for instance, rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By reducing car usage, the air quality improves, reducing respiratory problems and other health issues. Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event has been successful in changing people's behavior and has been replicated in other cities as well.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the opportunity for more compact and accessible communities. Traditionally, suburbs have been designed around car use, which has led to increased traffic congestion and sprawling developments. However, efforts are being made to create suburban areas that prioritize public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Vauban in Germany is a prime example of this approach, where stores are located within walking distance on a main street, reducing the need for long car journeys to shopping malls.

Reducing car usage can also have economic benefits. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, highlighting the reliance on cars for certain businesses. However, by shifting to alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or public transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs.

Overall, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more accessible communities and promoting healthier lifestyles. While the transition may require changes in infrastructure and individual habits, the benefits to both individuals and the environment make it a worthwhile endeavor.",1

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place as the method for selecting the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several practical advantages that would be lost if we were to abandon it. In this letter, I would like to present my case for why the Electoral College is a critical and valuable component of our election process.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. With the winner-takes-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This certainty helps to maintain stability and prevents a dispute over the popular vote, as witnessed in the 2000 presidential election.

Another important reason to keep the Electoral College is the idea of having ""everyone's President."" As Judge Posner explains, no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This requirement forces presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal and discourages a candidate with only regional support. This ensures that the president represents the interests and concerns of the entire nation, and not just a single region.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states, as mentioned in Judge Posner's text. Swing states become the focus of campaign efforts, and voters in these states are more likely to be engaged and informed. This system allows for more thoughtful decision-making by voters who are aware that their vote will have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. In this way, the Electoral College motivates candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters and ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a say in the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to our political system, addressing the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as discussed by Judge Posner. Large states, although underrepresented in the Senate, gain more attention from presidential candidates due to their larger number of electoral votes. This helps to prevent a scenario where candidates focus solely on small, densely populated states, neglecting the concerns and interests of larger states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process. With the Electoral College, a clear winner can be determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular votes. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and allows for a smoother and more efficient election process.

Though some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is still relatively high in presidential elections. As Judge Posner points out, voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preference rather than the belief that a single vote could decide the election. Therefore, the potential decrease in voter turnout should not be the sole factor in the decision to abolish the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves an important function in our presidential election process. It ensures a certainty of outcome, fosters a sense of national representation, encourages candidates to engage with diverse voter populations, provides balance to our political system, and avoids run-off elections. While a change to a popular vote system may seem appealing at first glance, it is essential to consider the practical advantages that the Electoral College offers. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in our elections for the benefit and stability of our democracy.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will consider the information provided and make a decision that upholds the integrity of our election process.

Sincerely,

"The electoral college is how presidents get elected. But when people vote for president they do not directly vote. The electoral collge does not work and is irrational. It does not help anyone and can cause a candidate to lose the presidential election. It just does not work anymore.

The electoral college does not work. ""The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" By Bradford Plumer says "" The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"". They are talking about how Al gore got the popular vote yet George bush won. This is a prime example how the electoral college doesn work. The voters were cheated into there win. This just shows how unfair it is. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defense of the system are wrong"" By Bradford Plumer says ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This basically says it is possible for u to have no input in what u vote for. If your vote does not count then why should u vote. The system doesn work and needs to be tossed. The whole point of americas government is that your voice matters but apparently the electoral collge is free from the rule.

The electoral college is out of date according to the article. ""In defense of the electoral collge : Five reasons to keep our despised method of chhosing the president"", says "" The electoral College is widley regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president out to be Overruled by declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner"". This article speaks the truth. Being a democratic like america the people rule and if this method is not democractic then off with it. It does not benifit us and will do more harm then good. ""In defense of the electoral collge : Five reasons to keep our despised method of chhosing the president"", says"" The electoral collge avoids the problem of elections in which no candidte recieves a mojority of the votes cast."" But that should be the reason one is elected. If they are most popular than why do they not get the vote. If they did the best campainge they should get the victory.

The electoral college is old and illogical. It is tired and needs to be replaced. AMerica is a new country and americans like new things. Change may not all ways be fun but it may be right. WHy should americans go through this hell anymore. Elctions are you as an individual trying to get the one who you approve into office. This is wjhy the electoral college is old and needs to retire. For america.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This trend can be seen in the examples of Vauban, a German suburb, Paris, and Bogota, Colombia. By limiting car usage, these communities have experienced several advantages, including reduced pollution, improved quality of life, and increased accessibility to public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can go up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging residents to give up their cars or use them less frequently, these communities are able to significantly lower their carbon footprint. This is particularly important considering the urgent need to combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to a better quality of life for residents. In Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move to the community. Residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. They are able to walk or bike around the community, enjoy the peacefulness of car-free streets, and interact with their neighbors. This sense of community and connection is often lost in car-dependent suburbs.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the use of public transportation and other alternative forms of transportation. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to reduce pollution and congestion. As a result, congestion decreased by 60% and public transit was made free of charge. Bogota, Colombia also implemented a car-free day, during which millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. These initiatives not only reduce traffic and congestion but also make public transportation more accessible and convenient.

It is worth noting that limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. In these communities, car ownership is allowed, but there are limited parking spaces available. This encourages residents to use cars as a last resort and prioritize other forms of transportation. It also promotes the idea of sharing vehicles through programs like car-sharing and carpooling, which can further reduce the number of cars on the road.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the quality of life for residents, and increase accessibility to public transportation. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the effectiveness of such initiatives in creating more sustainable and livable communities. By embracing smart planning and reducing our dependence on cars, we can work towards a greener and more connected future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have various advantages for both individuals and the environment. This trend is being adopted in many places around the world as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable living. The passages provided highlight the benefits of limiting car usage in various locations, such as Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia. These examples show how car-free communities and initiatives can lead to a better quality of life and a healthier environment.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to global warming and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some US car-intensive areas, this number can go up to 50%. By limiting car usage, these emissions can be drastically reduced, helping to mitigate climate change and improve air quality.

In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community has been established where only two places for car parking are allowed. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% sold their cars to move there. Residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without the constant need for a car. This shows that limiting car usage can lead to a better quality of life by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit.

Paris, France, recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air due to intense smog. This measure resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and improved air quality. Although some delivery companies complained of lost revenue, exceptions were made for electric and hybrid vehicles, promoting the use of more eco-friendly transportation options. By limiting car usage, cities can combat pollution and create a healthier environment for their residents.

Car-free days have also been implemented in Bogota, Colombia, as a means of reducing smog and promoting alternative transportation. The success of these days has led to an expansion of the program to other cities in the country. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion and pollution, encouraging people to use buses, bikes, or walk to work instead. This initiative has seen positive results, with millions of Colombians participating and experiencing the benefits of car-free transportation.

In summary, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create a healthier and more sustainable environment. Additionally, it can enhance quality of life by promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing stress associated with car ownership. Initiatives like car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage and provide a blueprint for more sustainable living. As these examples show, this trend is gaining momentum around the world, and its benefits are becoming increasingly recognized.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Car culture has long been a defining characteristic of suburbs around the world. However, recent studies and experiments have shown the benefits of limiting car usage and embracing alternative transportation methods. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can experience improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased accessibility, and a healthier and happier lifestyle overall.

One of the most notable examples of limiting car usage is the community of Vauban in Germany. In Vauban, cars are not allowed on the streets except for the main thoroughfare and a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to move to this car-free community. Residents of Vauban have reported increased happiness and reduced stress levels since giving up their cars. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved mental well-being and a better quality of life.

Limiting car usage also has environmental benefits. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, automobiles contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. This is especially important considering that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, just behind power plants.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is increased accessibility to public transportation. In Vauban, stores are located within walking distance on a main street, making it convenient for residents to access their daily needs without relying on cars. This model is being adopted around the world as an attempt to make suburbs more compact and accessible. By placing stores and amenities within walking distance, communities can reduce the need for long commutes and create a more connected and vibrant atmosphere.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive implications for urban planning and development. Traditional suburbs with sprawling homes and private garages, like Levittown and Scarsdale in New York, may soon be outdated. Instead, communities that prioritize smart planning and reduce reliance on cars are gaining momentum. This shift in focus can lead to the development of more vibrant and sustainable neighborhoods, with improved infrastructure and a better balance between transportation options.

While there may be concerns about the economic impact of limiting car usage, studies suggest that the cultural shift away from car ownership is already underway. Recent research indicates that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This change in behavior can have beneficial implications for carbon emissions, the environment, and personal transportation habits. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already adapting their business models to embrace a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles, recognizing that the future may lie in alternative transportation methods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for communities. By reducing reliance on cars, residents can experience improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased accessibility, and a healthier and happier lifestyle overall. As more communities embrace smart planning and alternative transportation methods, the traditional car-centric suburbs may give way to more sustainable and vibrant neighborhoods.",1
"What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by electoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter.Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win.When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good.You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe.

In the other hand,voting by Electoral College benefited us.Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. according to the last article ""In 2012's election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney...."" That means their votes helped Obama win. also the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done.

To summarise my reasonnings Electoral College votes should be change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier.Without happy people the country would be upside down.",0
"Dear state senator, Many people do not think that the Electoral College is not fair, or exact. In fact, people wanted to boycott it in 2000. I suggest that we change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is fair to the candidates and to the people of our country, and we should be able to choose our president, not the electors. Also, if we keep the Electoral College, voting will be unfair and it only makes people want to stop voting. I will explain to you the details of these reasons why we should change it in the rest of my letter.

To begin with, we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone. The people want a fair election. Presidents can be chosen wisely by the people, and candidates will be chosen fairly. People want a safe election, so that they can feel safe and protected with the president that we all chose together. It is only unfair to not let us have the advantage of expressing our own opinions. That is a reason why we should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

The second reason why we should change to popular voting is because we, as in the people of the United States, should have the advantage of voting for our own president, not the electors. The people know what they want and need to vote for the candidate based on their own opinions. Electors have different opinions, which is not fair at all since we are not really voting. They are only changing our votes and not agreeing with the votes of the people. That is the second reason why the government should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

A disadvantage of keeping the Electoral College is that it is unfair and it makes less people want to vote for a president. In 2012, only half of the whole United States voted for a president. They did not think voting was really necessary anymore, since we are not really voting. It also makes the people feel worthless since their votes do not really count anymore. We basically do not have a say in our own country, and that is not fair to us or the government. That is why keeping the Electoral College is a bad idea, and we should change it.

This is why you should reconsider changing to popular vote, for the good of our country. It is honestly a much better process for our country , the citizens, and especially for the candidates that want to make a great difference in the place we live in. Popular voting is fair to candidates and people, we should choose our president, not electors, and the Electoral College is unfair and makes less people want to vote. Thank you for reading and listening to my letter. Have a great day.",0
"Dear State Senator, This letter of argument is to emphasize why we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are very reasonable arguments for both claims as to if we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electorss by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electorss and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote.

It is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want it is dependent upon which party the electors chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electorss vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electorsal vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party's candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electorsal vote.

If that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. The Electoral College is unfair to voters they do not get the final choice as to where their vote goes. They are not voting for the presidential candidate they want. The voters are voting for a slate of electorss. However, there are some benefits to having an Electoral College such as larger states getting more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states and it also avoids RunOff elections which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes.

State Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.",0

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method for selecting the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe that the Electoral College is crucial in preserving the democratic values that our nation holds dear. 

One of the key reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the elected President has a clear majority in the Electoral College, providing stability and preventing disputes over the results. Furthermore, the Electoral College system reduces the likelihood of a tie in the electoral vote, unlike in a popular vote system where such a scenario could occur more frequently.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it makes the President accountable to the diverse interests of the entire nation. With each state having a different number of electors based on their representation in Congress, presidential candidates are compelled to campaign in various regions and address the concerns of the citizens in those areas. This requirement forces candidates to have trans-regional appeal and prevents them from solely focusing on densely populated areas or specific regions. By necessitating broad national support, the Electoral College ensures that the elected President represents all Americans, not just a majority concentrated in a few populous states.

Additionally, the Electoral College's winner-take-all method encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. As Judge Posner highlights, this promotes the engagement of voters in these toss-up states who are aware that their votes carry significant weight in deciding the election. Swing states play a crucial role in shaping national policies as candidates focus on addressing the concerns and priorities of these states, thereby allowing for a diverse range of voices to be heard in the presidential campaign.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system provides a balance of power between large and small states. By ensuring that less populous states have a voice in electing the President, the Electoral College mitigates the disproportionate influence of heavily populated states. This is particularly important in maintaining the political equilibrium enshrined in the Constitution, wherein both the House of Representatives and the Senate represent the interests of the states collectively. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard against marginalizing the voices and concerns of citizens residing in smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. This prevents further complications and costs associated with prolonged election processes. By design, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, avoiding indecisive outcomes and the requirement for additional voting rounds.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system upholds the principles of our democratic republic, ensuring that each citizen's vote is meaningful and that the President represents the diverse interests of the entire nation. By maintaining this system, we can preserve the stability, accountability, and inclusivity that the Electoral College provides. I kindly urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College as a vital component of our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your ongoing dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"There are numerous advantages to limiting car usage, as highlighted in the provided passages. One advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, these emissions can be significantly reduced.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of smart planning and compact suburbs. The passages mention the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is limited, resulting in 70 percent of families not owning cars. Similar concepts are being adopted around the world to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach involves placing stores within walking distance and reducing the reliance on car-centric development. By doing so, communities become more walkable, promote healthier lifestyles, and reduce the need for car travel.

Limiting car usage also has positive impacts on air quality. The passage about Paris reveals that a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. This resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. The ban targeted vehicles with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates on different days. By limiting car usage during periods of high pollution, cities can improve air quality and reduce health risks associated with pollution.

Additionally, promoting alternative transportation options can lead to reduced stress for individuals. The residents of Vauban, Germany, mentioned in one of the passages, expressed their happiness and reduced tension after giving up their cars. By relying on alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, individuals can experience a more active and stress-free lifestyle.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, mentions a car-free day program aimed at promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog. Such programs can ease traffic congestion, lower infrastructure costs, and improve access to public transportation. This can result in improved economic productivity and reduced expenses for individuals and governments.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of smart planning, improved air quality, reduced stress, and positive economic impacts. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation and adopting car-free initiatives, communities can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment.",1
"Whether if it's a law in a country, the source of pollution or the cause of deaths, the usage of cars have its disadvantages and have been limited. However, driving cars have its advantages when individuals limit the use of it.

Using cars to reach a destination causes pollution according to experts, who are correct. According to paragraph 5, ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipe...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Because of this there has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities safer and easier to breathe in. A city that faces these pollution problems is Paris, which made authorities to prohibit driving. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This is the right thing to do because after this law was implemented there was less congestion. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" Pollution also has more of an impact depending on the temperature and day. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions."" Also there are cities where using cars are near impossible, because of the laws that the governmental officials had enforced. An example of a city with these laws is Vauban, Germany. ""Street Parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. vaughn's streets are completely carfree.""' However, There are advantages when individuals drive less. Owners of the public transportation have taken action. They subliminally convinced drivers to reduce pollution and dangerous accidental by offering free transportation. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday."" When this was taken into action, smog was cleared in cities. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" When individuals drive less they are exposed to new activities that they have never experienced when driving. People can experience activities in places such as in Bogota, Colombia. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" The main goal for this was to advocate other transportation in order to reduce pollution. There are also other factors that can substitute the place of driving. A suggestion was made by Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of the University's Policy center and Mobilities Research. She said that ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Also that ""the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared services for getting to work."" Bill Ford, who is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has also suggested factors for safety and transportation. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'"" Using cars for transporation is mostly a problem, even if authorities have enforced a law for it, if it causes pollution or even danger in cities. But, it can only be a good thing if individuals are limiting the usage of it.",0

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides important benefits and should be preserved. I would like to present my arguments in favor of the Electoral College based on information from various sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As Judge Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome is less likely than it would be under a popular vote system. Additionally, the winner-take-all method used by most states in allocating electoral votes creates a landslide victory for the candidate with even a slight plurality in that state. This reduces the likelihood of an electoral tie, ensuring a clear outcome in the presidential election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's President."" By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, it prevents candidates from focusing solely on certain regions and neglecting others. This ensures that the elected president represents and considers the interests of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner argues, without this requirement, a candidate with only regional appeal would be unlikely to be a successful president, and residents of other regions would feel disenfranchised.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. This is beneficial because voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions, as they know they will have a significant impact on the election outcome. The focus on swing states also helps to ensure that the most thoughtful voters have a decisive role in electing the president, as Judge Posner suggests.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance between large and small states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on the most populous states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states. As Judge Posner notes, a victory by a small margin in a large state can result in significantly more electoral votes compared to a comparable victory in a small state. This gives large states the attention and consideration they deserve in presidential campaigns.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the complications and uncertainties associated with run-off elections. As Judge Posner argues, the Electoral College reduces the pressure for run-off elections and provides a much simpler presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as an important mechanism for ensuring a fair and well-balanced approach to electing the President of the United States. Its benefits, such as certainty of outcome, representation for all regions, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections, demonstrate why it should be maintained. While arguments can be made in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and reliable method throughout history. I urge you to consider these points when discussing any proposals to change our current system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the advantages of the Electoral College and support its continuation. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Sincerely,

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and active participant in the democratic process, I wanted to share my perspective on the issue of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While there are arguments for both sides, I firmly believe that preserving the Electoral College system is crucial for maintaining the fairness and representative nature of our electoral process.

First and foremost, it is imperative to understand the purpose and function of the Electoral College. As stated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This compromise allows for a balance of power between state interests and equal representation by population size.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes over the electoral vote count, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the president-elect has a clear mandate and support from a broad range of states, fostering stability and legitimacy in the political system.

The preservation of regional appeal is another crucial aspect of the Electoral College. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system prevents candidates from exclusively targeting densely populated areas or focusing solely on specific states. This ensures that individuals from all regions of the country have a stake in the election and enough attention from the candidates to voice their concerns and priorities.

The Electoral College system also promotes the significance of swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates are compelled to campaign in toss-up states, where voters are more attentive and thoughtful about the decisions they make. This encourages a more informed electorate by increasing political engagement and encouraging candidates to address the concerns and issues relevant to swing states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political power distribution. While the malapportionment of the Senate may weaken the representation of large states, the Electoral College ensures that they receive more attention than smaller states during the campaign trail. This prevents a concentration of power in certain regions and guarantees that the interests and needs of diverse states are considered during the presidential race.

Lastly, the Electoral College serves as a safeguard against the complications of run-off elections. By invariably producing a clear winner, it reduces the pressure for further elections when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the presidential election process and allows the country to move forward without the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is indispensable in preserving the fairness and representativeness of the United States presidential elections. Its ability to provide certainty of outcome, ensure regional representation, encourage attention to swing states, balance the political power between large and small states, and avoid run-off elections are all strong reasons to maintain this system. While there may be calls to switch to a popular vote system, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences and disadvantages that a different system might bring.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will give careful thought and consideration to the importance of the Electoral College in our democracy. Your dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our nation is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage can bring several advantages to both individuals and communities. As highlighted by the passage set, reducing car dependency can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, the overall carbon footprint can be effectively reduced, contributing to the effort in combating climate change and improving the environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage on Paris's driving ban highlights how congestion was reduced by 60 percent during the ban, resulting in a decrease in smog levels comparable to some of the most polluted cities in the world. The reduction in car emissions, particularly from diesel vehicles, can have a positive impact on air quality and reduce respiratory health issues in communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. The passage on Bogota's car-free day demonstrates how alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, can be promoted through initiatives like car-free days. Encouraging these modes of transportation not only reduces pollution but also encourages physical activity and improves public health. Moreover, designing communities with fewer cars in mind, as seen in Vauban, Germany, can create more accessible and walkable neighborhoods, with stores and services within walking distance. This reduces the need for unnecessary car trips and promotes a sense of community.

While some may argue that limiting car usage may inconvenience individuals, it is important to recognize the long-term benefits it brings to society as a whole. The passage suggests that there is a cultural shift happening, particularly among younger generations, where car ownership and driving are becoming less important. This shift aligns with efforts to reduce carbon emissions and create more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, the advantages of limiting car usage can be realized for the benefit of both individuals and the environment.",1
"Electoral College is the way American people get to chose who they want to represent their state or country. Why get rid of a system that has few flaws and gives people a since of picking their people? Electoral College should be kept because gives candidates a fair chance and lets everyone pick a representation.

To begin, electoral college gives candidates a fair chance. In source 3 it states "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This explains that even if only a candidate only represent one region of the country electoral college can still give them a chance to win presidency. In source 1 it states "" Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This means electoral college gives a candidate a group of supporters to help him or her win a election.

furthermore, electoral college gives the people a right to pick a representation. In source 1 it states "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". Everyone who is a United States citizen has the right to vote for who they want for representation for each state. In source 3 it states "" Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". Thoughtful votes or people who just vote because everyone else is doing it doesnt matter. Everyone could vote for anyone with electoral college.

""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"". I disagree with this statement because the electoral college gives candidates a fair chance to win electons and the people get to pick who they want to represent their states.

In conclusion, electoral college should be kept because it gives candidates a fair chance and allows the people to pick who they want to represent them.",0
"The most basic and persistent form of transportation that has been around for centuries has been the use of cars. Hundreds of thousands of people use automobiles to get to their destinations in a quicker and more efficient way. Recently, all over the world, places like Germany and Paris have been rethinking their dependency on cars. Ongoing issues regarding pollution and stress have all been traced back to using a car daily. By limiting everyday car usage, greenhouse gas emissions, constant road rage, and lack of space for other recreational purposes will decrease or even be eliminated.

Pollution and global warming is a growing problem that has been affecting animals, people, and the air that we breathe. Slowly, the polluted air is becoming more and more infected. Cars and their tailpipe are a main contributor towards this issue. Studies have shown that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in the United States"" Rosenthal 1. The gas that is being released into the air does not have any way of being recycled. With a large amount of gas being released daily, the air can quickly become polluted with toxins and gas that normally is not used in the human body. In Paris, the intensifying smog caused a buildup of car traffic, which ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" Duffer 1. Also, Paris had been found to have more smog that the other European capitals had, ""last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"" Reuters 1. This was purely because of the amount of cars, scooters, and buses that Paris has roaming around the cities. The decision to ban car use for oddnumbered license plates cleared the smog that prevented the drivers from using their cars.

Road rage is common in drivers that constantly have to deal with pedestrians, other cars, and the amount of traffic lights on the streets. The instinct to yell and become angered while driving has developed and grown into stress that affects an average person. Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, has ditched her car and resorted to using her own two feet as her way of transportation. Walter says ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Instead of having to hear honks and beeps from incoming cars, she is surrounded by the calm streets filled with bicycles, wandering children, and the occasional automobile. Being a part of the suburban neighborhoods means that a quiet and serene environment is typical and common. Therefore, being thrusted onto the busy streets may be an enzyme to stress and road rage.

Recreational areas, such as parks and shopping centers, are a way of allowing people to relax and enjoy their free time. However, buildings are being demolished to make rooms for new highways and roads to allow for more efficient ways of traveling for the excessive amount of cars that there are on the streets. There are attempts being made to ""make the suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking"". Also, stores are beginning to be placed on a main street, instead of in shopping malls alongside highways Rosenthal 1. These ideas take away from living spaces and create difficulty for those who want to go into a store. In Bogota, Columbia, Mayor Antanas Mockus has created a program that bans cars for the Day Without Cars. This day is part of an idea and campaign to reduce stress and air pollution. Since this day began in the mid 1990's, ""parks and sport centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have been dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky 1.

Since the invention in the 1800's, cars have been depended on to take one or more people from Point A to Point B in a safe and fast way. For centuries, that has been a reasonable form of transportation. But as air pollution is increasing, drivers are becoming more angry, and land space is being taken up by new roads and streets the idea of cars is being frowned upon. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from a incipient shift in American behavior..."" Rosenthal 1. Limiting car use allows for a healthier environment filled with other forms of transportation like walking, biking, and etc. Countries are beginning to form bans on cars forcing fellow citizens to lower their car usage. Last year, Bill Ford created a business plan in order to change America's way of transportation. He vowed to adjust future and current cities in which, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"", eventually creating a better world for generations to come.",0
"Cars have helped people over the years, but has it helped the environment or your heath. When driving a car, the car releases gases that can effect the air around us. There are advantages of limiting the use of cars, like a heathier environment and a heathier body.

One advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier environment. When you are driving a car the gas in the car, is let out into the air. The gas that goes in the air can effect the air and plants around us, as it can turn to toxic. As the source Elisabeth Rosenthal explains, 50 percent of the greenhouse gases are caused by carintensive areas in the United States. The gas from are cars are not just effecting are air, there effecting are greenhouse to. The source Robert Duffer tells us, how paris banded using cars after days of nearrecord pollution to clear the air. After days of no cars the air was clear again. As you can tell, limiting car uses will help the environment lot.

furthermore, Another advantage of limiting the use of cars is a heathier body. Instead of just siting in a car you can ride a bike,walk or roller skate. Also all those gases from the car wont be going in your body, effecting your insides. As the source Andrew Selsky explains, in Colombia on free car day the people hicked,skated and bicked to get where they need to go, instead of using a car. Without a car to take you places you will get exercie, which will give you power and engery for your body. A normal person should also exercise for 30 mintes a day. Also as Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us without a car you have less stress and are able to relax more. Cars can cause people lot of stress, and a lot of stress is not good for your body. Limiting the use of cars has a great effect on your heath.

Conslusion, Limiting the use of cars will have the advantages of a heathier environment and a heathier body. The environment and your body is a big thing in your life, so you would want to do whatever possible to keep it heathy. So instead of talking the car try to walk or ride a bike next time.",0
"Explanatory Essay: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage is a concept that is gaining popularity in various parts of the world. As discussed in the passages, there are numerous advantages to restricting the use of cars, both for individuals and for the environment. This essay will delve deeper into these advantages and illustrate why limiting car usage can be a beneficial approach.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, we can drastically reduce these emissions and contribute to tackling the global issue of climate change. This approach aligns with the goals outlined by President Obama to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passages discuss how the smog in Paris and Bogota prompted driving bans, resulting in reduced congestion and pollution. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, walking, or cycling, we can significantly improve the air quality in cities. This is particularly important in densely populated areas where air pollution can have detrimental effects on public health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential reduction in traffic congestion. In cities like Vauban, Germany, where car usage is limited, there is less dependence on cars, and the streets are significantly less crowded. This can lead to smoother traffic flow and less time wasted in traffic jams. Additionally, reducing congestion can also result in fewer accidents and improved overall road safety.

Limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on urban planning and the design of communities. As discussed in the passages, the concept of ""smart planning"" involves creating suburbs that are more accessible to public transportation and have less emphasis on parking spaces. This shift allows for the allocation of space to alternative modes of transportation and the development of more pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, with amenities such as stores located within walking distance.

Moreover, limiting car usage can bring about behavioral changes in individuals. As the passages suggest, younger generations are becoming less interested in car ownership and more open to alternative transportation options. This shift in mindset can lead to a decrease in car dependence and a greater emphasis on sustainable modes of transportation. It can also pave the way for the development of innovative solutions such as car-sharing programs and advancements in public transit networks.

In conclusion, there are several benefits to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to alleviating traffic congestion and promoting sustainable urban planning, the advantages are significant for both individuals and the environment. As more cities and communities embrace this approach, we can work towards creating a future that is less reliant on cars and more focused on sustainable and efficient transportation alternatives.",1

Subject: Arguing in Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my stance on the Electoral College system and urge you to consider the benefits of retaining this method of electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College is a process established by our founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and a direct popular vote. While some argue that it is undemocratic, there are several key reasons why keeping the Electoral College is essential for the stability and fairness of our electoral system.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote system, where disputes over the outcome are more likely, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents a contestation of results, which could lead to prolonged disputes and undermine the legitimacy of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions and not just those of heavily populated areas. With each state having a minimum of three electoral votes (including the 23rd Amendment, which includes the District of Columbia), candidates are compelled to have trans-regional appeal. This requirement prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming president and guarantees that the President will be everyone's President.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. By focusing on these states, candidates have to appeal to a diverse range of voters and address their concerns effectively. This system promotes accountability and policy discussions that encompass various perspectives, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters, who pay close attention to the campaign, decide the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College recognizes the importance of balance in our political system. It gives smaller states a voice by providing each state with a minimum number of electoral votes, regardless of population size. This balance is crucial in the context of large versus small states, preventing heavily populated areas from dominating national elections and ensuring that candidates pay attention to the concerns of all states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College provides a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional elections that could prolong the process and create further uncertainty.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences, rather than believing their vote to be decisive in determining the outcome. The existence of the Electoral College does not deter voter participation significantly.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its time-tested merits, is an integral part of our democracy. It ensures certainty of outcome, enables the President to represent all regions, encourages campaign focus on swing states, provides balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly advocate for keeping the Electoral College intact.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully examine the benefits of retaining the Electoral College and make decisions that uphold the principles on which our great nation was founded.

Yours faithfully,

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This trend can be seen in various cities around the world, where car-free districts or car-free days have been implemented. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the information provided in the passages.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards mitigating climate change. This is especially important considering that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog highlights the negative impact of car emissions on air quality. The smog in Paris rivaled that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and reducing car usage, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for both urban and suburban areas.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This not only reduces congestion and traffic jams but also encourages physical activity, which is beneficial for individual health. By designing cities and suburbs in a way that prioritizes walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can create more active and healthy communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban states that 70 percent of families in the community do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car in order to move there. This suggests that households can save money by not owning a car. The cost of car ownership, including fuel, maintenance, and insurance, can be a significant financial burden for many families. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative forms of transportation, individuals can save money and allocate resources towards other priorities.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of physical activity, and potential economic benefits. The passages provided evidence of the success of car-free districts, driving bans, and car-free days in various cities around the world. It is clear that limiting car usage is a viable solution to address the negative impacts of car dependency and move towards more sustainable and healthy communities.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the arguments for both keeping the Electoral College and switching to direct election by popular vote. After reviewing multiple sources, including The Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner's article, ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" I firmly believe that the Electoral College is essential in maintaining the fairness and effectiveness of our electoral process.

One of the key benefits of the Electoral College system is that it provides certainty of outcome. As mentioned by Judge Posner, while disputes over the electoral vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state ensures that a candidate with even a slight plurality in a state secures a landslide electoral-vote victory. Thus, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of tied elections and potential disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the idea of a president who represents all Americans. Unlike a direct popular vote, where candidates could focus their efforts only on densely populated areas, the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner argues, this regional diversity ensures that no single region dominates the election, preventing the majority from feeling disenfranchised. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it encourages candidates to engage with diverse perspectives and address the needs of citizens across the country.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is that it leads to a focus on swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates are incentivized to campaign and invest resources in swing states. As noted in the text, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention and become better-informed voters. This ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged citizens have a greater influence on election outcomes, enhancing the democratic process as a whole.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance among states of different sizes. It counteracts the mal-apportionment of the Senate by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. As the text points out, a narrow popular vote victory in a large state like Florida yields significantly more electoral votes than a similar victory in a small state such as Wyoming. This maintains a sense of fairness and political balance, preventing larger states from dominating smaller ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, ensuring clear winners in presidential elections. In circumstances where no candidate receives a majority in the popular vote, as seen with Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College guarantees a decisive outcome. Avoiding run-off elections streamlines the election process and saves valuable time and resources.

While I acknowledge the arguments against the Electoral College, such as it being undemocratic and potentially leading to swing state dominance, I firmly believe that the benefits it provides outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College upholds fairness, promotes trans-regional representation, encourages swing state engagement, balances state influence, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I respectfully urge you to support the continued use of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Its practical advantages and the safeguards it provides against potential election disputes and domination by a few regions highlight the importance of this system for the integrity of our democracy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective, along with the information presented from multiple sources, when contemplating any potential changes to our election process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"A growing trend in day to day life that is occurring around the world is ""carfree"" day. Carfree day has spread in cities and towns around Europe and the Americas to separate suburban life from automobile use. This is beneficial in many ways to the growth, forward movement, and health of towns. So far Europe, Asia, and the Americas have given up car usage for a day, and even given up car usage entirely.

Different cities practice carfree day differently. In Paris, the nearrecord pollution was at its height. The city participated in carfree day by enforcing a partial driving ban and making people with even numbered license plates leave their cars at home. The following day, the odd numbered license plates were confined to home. Any person who didn't follow guidelines and conduct was fined. The congestion of smog in the capital of France decreased by sixty percent. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, like Brussels and London. By participating in the carfree day, Paris was able to contribute to cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and temporarily fix a few environmental concerns in Paris. Even though they had some effective results, Paris wasn't the only city that participated in the trend.

Across the Atlantic ocean in Bogota, the program allowed Colombians of Bogota to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. The carfree day left the normally busy, full and loud streets devoid of traffic jams. The goal to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog was enforced by minor fines. Despite the fact that rain showers were common, it did not stop the people from participating. The people of he town viewed it as a day of taking away stress and lowering ar pollution. The day without cars has been part of an improvement campaign since the mid 1990s, and has since been practiced at least one day out of the year. Authorities from countries all around the world have gone to the event and were impressed and some were inspired. Even other cities that are in colombia have joined the event like Cali and Valledupar.

Back in Europe, the city of Vauban, Germany, has taken place in a permanent carband. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are nearly forbidden in the experimental and new district of Freiburg. While car ownership is allowed, there are only two places to park. People that live there generally like the way of life in Vauban. Many of them sold their cars just to move there in the first place. The overall feeling of living in a city free of cars seems to lift stress of the people that live there. Therefore, the people are happier and more productive. Vauban is known as the most advanced experiment in attmepts to make suburbs more compact and have a minut number of vehicles. Supermarkets and stores as a result have been moved to a closer distance so that they could be walking distance away. Our development as people over the past century hads been based on the car, and Vauban goes completely against the idea that progress is based off of the car.

Even in America, Obama is ambitious to change the amount of the United States pollution. While although cities have yet to participate in carfree day, Citizens are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses across America each year. This gives researchers the idea that America is passed the peak driving level. American life has been integrated with cars from the time that the Model T was born. As the amount of jobs decrease, people just can not afford to buy cars. People in America have lost the general idea of a car and it's uses. Young adults in college have learned to use other ways of transport like carpooling with a friend, public transportation, or walking to the destination. The amount of people has dropped more than twenty percent and still continues to drop. This incipient stage of American life has implied the idea of alternatives to multiple motored vehicles.

Cities all around the world are deciding to practice their own car free day and are decreasing the use of cars altogether. The practice of carfree day has caused parks to initiate, sidewalks to be prepared repaired, cut traffic, give joy to the people, and overall diminish air pollution.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid over-reliance on a single source.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).

One counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party's nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).

The first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.

The Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal (Passage 19). No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding run-off elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a global trend due to its numerous advantages. Car-dependent suburbs are a significant impediment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. By adopting a car-free or car-reduced lifestyle, societies can reduce their carbon footprints and create more sustainable communities. The advantages of limiting car usage include improving the environment, reducing traffic congestion, promoting health, and enhancing community cohesion.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and alternative transportation is encouraged, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This leads to a significant reduction in emissions from transportation, benefiting both local and global environments.

Limiting car usage also helps to alleviate traffic congestion. The passage mentions that suburbs are heavily reliant on cars, which leads to increased traffic and congestion. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and ease traffic congestion. For instance, during a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, the streets were devoid of traffic jams, resulting in a smoother flow of vehicles. By adopting car-reduced or car-free initiatives, cities can reduce congestion and make their transportation systems more efficient.

Another major advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on public health. Car-free or car-reduced communities promote physical activity through walking and cycling. These modes of transportation have been shown to improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of obesity, and enhance overall well-being. By encouraging people to adopt active transportation options, we can reduce sedentary behavior and promote healthier lifestyles. Furthermore, by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can also improve air quality, leading to fewer respiratory problems and related health issues.

Limiting car usage can also foster community cohesion. The passage highlights how car-free communities like Vauban in Germany promote walking and cycling by placing stores within walking distance rather than in distant malls. This creates a more walkable and interconnected community, where people can interact with their neighbors and have a stronger sense of belonging. By reducing car dependency, people are more likely to engage in their local communities and form meaningful social connections.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing car dependency, we can improve the environment, reduce traffic congestion, promote health, and enhance community cohesion. Initiatives like car-free days, car-reduced communities, and promoting alternative modes of transportation can help us achieve these benefits. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards creating more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a goring trend in europe and the United states because of the positive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimately lead to a financial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positively effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they can become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and up to 50 percent in carintensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than paying for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of transportation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to the creation of jobs because they will need people to operate public transportation.

Lastly the removal of cars will have a positive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much pollutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness. Were already started down the path of less cars, recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

For the following benefits is why we should stop using cars and continue with the idea of using public tranportation and walking. Cars creat polution, its better for our economy to stop the use of cars and this will poitivley effect out furute.",0
"There is a growing movement in lots of western countries to do less driving. In Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, a ""Day Without Cars"" has been established. It is an annual event where residents of the city are banned from using cars, and violators are fined. In Paris, residents were banned from using their vehicles for about week due to toxic emmisions, widely blamed on diesel fuel. In Germany, a development neighborhood called Vauban was created and has a strict policy on parkingg. Carsized garages, and street parking are banned, requiring residents to pay an extra 40000 dollars to purchase a parkingg space in the neighborhood. These ideals are even spreading to America.

Driving will emit toxins into the air, called greenhouse gases. These gases rise into the air, but are trapped by the ozone layer into our atmosphere and make the Earth warmer. This is a bad thing because the Arctic will start to melt and sea levels would rise. Now, vehicles are not the sole cause of this epidemic, but they are a large contributor. In Beijing, China it is said to be so polluted due to tailpipe emmisions that one would get sick if they were to go outside without a mask on to stop from breathing in the chemicals. In Paris, France the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of Beijing. The city officials of Paris had to ban use of automobiles for about a week to rid the air of the poisons. If caught, violators were fined 22 euros 31 dollars American. This worked surprisingly well, and since the air cleared up, people are allowed to use their cars again. The Vauban in Germany is a neighborhood that has made it extremely difficult to own a vehicle. While vehicle ownership is permitted, carsized garages are not included in the homes, and parkingg on the street is prohibited. If a resident wishes to park their vehicles, they must spend 40000 extra dollars along with the house for a space in a large garage at the edge of the development. This has all lead to cleaner air and happier, healthier people.

It is a well known fact the walking and cycling helps a person stay in shape. It keeps the heart flowing regularly, helps keep the lungs exercised, and keeps leg muscles strong ad healthy. If these ways of transportation are exhibited more often, and vehicles used less, we will not only have cleaner air, but a healthier human population. Walking can also help the brain work with the body to relieve stress, which puts people at less of a risk for heart disease. These factors are essential to producing a healthier population, which could let people live longer, and encourage them to do meaningful things that could benefit other parts of the world. The Internet has also been helpful in keeping people connected with friends and lovedones without the need of driving to see them. It is possible to to center where you live around places to buy food and necessary supplies, as well as close to your workplace, all in walking distance. Even if that is not possible, finding a bus or public transportation route is always an option. It is less expensive than gasoline tax included, car insurance, and any other expenses that might come with a privatlyowned vehicle. It is also less likely to get into an autoaccident when using public transportaion, and if it does happen it is not your responsibility to pay for the insurance deductible. All these factors and alternative transportaion methods can help to improve life for all people than it is with so many privatelyowned vehicles.

The private owning of vehicles is convienient, but is still a hazard to the genearal health of our population. It poisons the air, and gives people an excuse to not walk or ride their bycyles as much, which can diminish their physical health. If we start to use privately owned vehicles less, however, it will promote the general welfare of our people. It is possible to cut the use of these vehicles short and preserve, even raise, our standards of living.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Preserving Democracy

Dear [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College has proven to be a vital process that ensures fair representation and stability within our democratic system. While some argue for a change towards a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College safeguards against potential chaos and preserves the will of the people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote, resulting in a clear victory. The winner-take-all system in most states allows for a decisive electoral result, reducing the likelihood of disputes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to close margins, recount requests, and potential challenges to the legitimacy of the election, as seen in the 2000 presidential election.

The Electoral College also ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. Without the Electoral College, presidential candidates might focus solely on heavily populated urban areas and neglect the concerns of rural communities. The regional appeal requirement promotes a more balanced representation of interests and prevents a concentration of power in specific areas. This is crucial for maintaining a government that serves the needs of all citizens and prevents the disenfranchisement of certain states or regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of those states that can potentially swing the election. As Judge Posner points out, swing state voters are likely to be the most thoughtful and engaged, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the final result. This focus on swing states fosters a more informed electorate and incentivizes candidates to address the concerns of a diverse range of voters.

The Electoral College also provides a balance between small and large states. Without this system, the political balance could tilt heavily in favor of large states at the expense of smaller states, as a result of the mal-apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to small states and their unique concerns, which would otherwise be overshadowed by large population centers. This balance is essential in maintaining the integrity and equal representation of all states within our democratic system.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the electoral process. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner by awarding the candidate with the majority of electoral votes. This eliminates the need for additional rounds of voting and guarantees a definitive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a crucial safeguard that upholds the principles of fairness, representation, and stability within our democracy. It promotes a balanced representation of regional interests, encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, provides a counterweight to the influence of large states, and ensures a clear winner without the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a direct popular vote, the Electoral College is a time-honored institution that has proven to be effective in preserving democratic values.

I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College. By doing so, we can uphold the integrity of our elections, promote fair representation, and safeguard the democratic principles upon which our nation was built.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving the interests of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" Source 4, is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons.

For starters, stress. It is no secret that morning traffic jams and o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly carless community, claiming ""when she had a car she was always tense. She's much happier that way"" Source 1. If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress"" Source 3. Just one day was enough to destress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event ""left the streets of Bogota eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3, which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?

Additionally, the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Source 1. This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" Source 4. It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even carpooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" Source 4.

Of course, adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health. Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible downsides to the easy transportation option. If it must be described as ""emissions... are choking cities"" Source 1, then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with preexisting respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other taskoriented location that many go to with the aid of a car.

It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly carless citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. In Vauban, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" Source 1. This is not only much more costefficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Source 3. Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well.

Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.",0
"There is many different advantages to limiting car use. The most important advantage to with this experiment is less gas emissions exit the exhaust pipes and cause greenhouse gases. This is a major advantage because our economy is filled with so much pollution and can and has caused serious damage to our health. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting many car reduced communities. Paris, France enforced a driving pan to clear its air of smog and toxic gases. Any motorist who got caught driving was forced to pay a fine of 31. If refusal to pay the fine came to, The drivers car was impounded. The main cause of this smog in Paris was caused by diesel fuel. Diesel vehicles make up 67 percent of vehicles in Europe.

Another main benefit from car and driving reduction is exercise. Instead of driving people can ride a bike, walk, jog or even run to get to their destination. In Bogota, Columbia there is a program that is possible to spread to other countries. Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day. In America studies show people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. This can help stop the obesity rating not only in the U.S. but also in many other countries.

Finally, Another advantage is people can save a whole lot more of money each week, month, and year. People of every country spends hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions on their car. Whether it is for gas or buying a completly new car, People are consistently spending hard earned money on something that can be avoided with a nice relaxing walk. With citizens not spending money on these so called ""necessities"", they will be able to buy more important things. For example, Many people will be able to purchase a newer home instead of living in a weekly rent pay of an apartment. This can give many people the feeling of accomplishment and the feeling of control over their life. They will also be able to purchase food and drink so they don't starve or dehydrate. Many people go hungry everyday and suffer from dehydration. With vehicles gone people can save the necessary money needed for more life saving things.",0
"The usage of cars has really changed the way our world works. These expensive vehicles are what make make our world what it is and people take advantage of it. With cars we get to places faster than on a bike or even walking. Many people forget how cars work though. It takes up about 2,000 dollars a month depending on which car they have on gas and maintenance. The advantages of limiting car usage is reducing the amount of fuel the we use, we would save thousands of dollars, and become more green in the world. People prefer walking or biking to school or on their way home.

Driving starts at the age of 15. Imagine all the work parents do to drive their kids to school, then to work, and then pick up their kids from after school. Its crazy how much of gas an adult would be using every single day. Ofcourse picking up their kids from school is a guarantee but their are many other solutions to these type of things. If we started to use less fuel it would bring our economy out of debt. In the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""The End of car culture"" states that Americans have not been buying cars as often and driving less and fewer license being given over the years. The era of cars and driving could be coming to an end and creating a new way of getting to places. People would say that taking the bus might become the new strategy but who knows what the future holds for America, by the year 2030 we will be flying in cars or transportation to get to where we need to be. Transportation is the second largest source in America and vehicles are becoming something much different.

In New York a bikesharing program has started due to all the traffic and crowded streets their are people just take the subway and get to places faster than a car. Things like that save so much money. A change in the world would be very dramatic since everyone is so used to driving a car and getting to where they need to be. Studies shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal that even kids who live in urban areas that are 1921 do not have license and are perfectly happy with out having one. With the amount of money people can save in motorvehicles is ridiculous. The money they save can be used for many other important things in life like food and house spending all those things can get someone stressed could be fixed just by reducing the use of cars. Who says walking or biking isn't good for the soul.

Technology has really changed our lives and made our generation of children a new perspective that other never saw. As a teenager we are so dependant on many thingas and get addicted very fast to whatever comes at us. A day with out a car is like a day with out a phone. We wouldnt be able to particapat in anything. A car will take us where we want to go. Unlike in those movies where all the kids just bike to places, it seems more fun and interesting in that way. With all the money being spent we could be more green in the world as well. Everything is so manufactured in the world that people wonder why our economy is awful. Being eco friendly is the best way to go if everyone particiaptes in the cause. The world would honestly be such a better place if we all particapated in making it better.

Causes and actions have consequences in our world. The usage of cxars are very dependant on people and if we made a change people will be happier in life because they'll have more to recieve. Our world can become a much better place where people won't have to suffer with money because due to cars we pay alot of money that doesnt have to be spent. Cars can increase alot of positive things in everyones life and it will start out just by a casual walk on the street.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. By reducing dependence on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more sustainable and vibrant communities. Several examples from around the world illustrate the benefits of limiting car usage.

One compelling example is the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but street parking and driveways are generally forbidden. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Residents have reported feeling happier and less tense without the constant need for a car. Vauban is part of a larger trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from auto use, known as ""smart planning."" This approach aims to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and less dependent on cars.

Another example is Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban to reduce smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, and the same applied to odd-numbered plates the following day. This policy resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and highlighted the impact of car usage on air pollution. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers. This demonstrates that there are alternatives to traditional car usage that can still cater to specific needs.

The city of Bogota in Colombia has also embraced car-free initiatives. In an annual event called the ""Day Without Cars,"" millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic. Violators of the car ban face fines, but the event has seen a large turnout and is now spreading to other cities. Bogota has invested in infrastructure for alternative transportation, such as 118 miles of bicycle paths, and has experienced improved air quality and reduced traffic congestion as a result.

These examples highlight the potential benefits of limiting car usage. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote physical activity. In addition, limiting car usage can lead to more vibrant and sustainable communities, with improved access to amenities and less space devoted to parking lots. Although there may be challenges and adjustments required, such as changes in transportation infrastructure and economic implications for certain industries, the long-term impact on the environment and society makes these efforts worthwhile.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and promoting healthier lifestyles, there are compelling reasons to adopt a more sustainable approach to transportation. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the potential benefits of limiting car usage and offer valuable insights for other communities seeking to make similar changes. By prioritizing alternative modes of transportation and creating more vibrant and accessible communities, we can create a healthier, cleaner, and more sustainable future.",1
"Dear senator, Every one has a voice and they all want to be heard. The Electoral College is an unfair method of calculating votes for the population while voting for a president of the United States. States begin to feel like it is not worth it to vote because their vote could be neglected or it would not hardly count. Electing presidents by using popular vote gives states a better advantage at choosing their president because they know their vote is in and someone else will not be able to change their choice. Popular vote is when all the people are allowed to vote for the president and every vote counts because based on the amount of votes the president receives from the people is who wins the election.

Electoral Colleges are when the people vote for the person they want to govern them and that vote goes to a person that could either decided to vote as the people choose, or vote for whom ever he feel should run. It lowers the peoples voices, they are unable to directly choose what they want because their choices could be changed. Electors don't have to vote favor of the person you would like. The difference between the Electoral College and popular vote is that in the Electoral College their are electorss that can choose to vote in favor of what we the people want if they agree with it. The electors doesn't have to choose what the people want. In popular voting, the whole population gets to choose who they want as president without worrying that their vote will be put aside. It makes sure that we the people get what we want. They could just change the vote and choose who they want to run as presidency. The Electoral College doe shelp the counting of the votes because there are only 538 voters however, we are in a different time where electrical machines can help calculate the total number of votes for a large population.

Citizens with the right to vote feel like it is not needed for them to vote because the have a low number of electorss, while having a large number of population. It would benefit them if instead of having a certain number of electorss that you have to ""trust"" and hope they vote for the candidate you are going for, they will be able to directly vote for them using the method of popular votes to chose the president. The citizens will know that their vote counts and that it can't be changed because they wont have electorss voting for them.

Popular vote gives the citizens freedom and it helps to better calculate what the people want. The United States is a nation that is governed by the people and is runned based on what we want. It wouldnt make sense to deprive us from our voting rights. The constitution states that this government was created by the people, from the people, for the people and allowing us to vote by popular will help reinforce this because it will give us the freedom and liberty to choose as we the people want.",0
"  A Path to Sustainable Urban Futures  In a world characterized by ever-increasing urbanization and environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a visionary approach to tackling the multifaceted challenges of modern urban life. These cities propose a profound shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban landscape.  Car-free cities represent a pioneering vision of urban living that prioritizes sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment. However, transitioning to this model is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities lies in their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By emphasizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. These cities effectively utilize urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation reinvigorates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Less reliance on private cars translates to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and lower stress levels for urban inhabitants. Furthermore, car ownership can be a substantial financial burden, and by depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, thereby enhancing their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities present a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation.

"Dear, Senator Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people. Also, the electoral college causes many issues during the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" Plumer Paragraph 10 What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the louisiana legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time, People would be let down when they find out that the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Plumer Paragraph 11 On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" Posner Paragraph 15 What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example, The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winnertakeall"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Plumer paragraph 14 It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.",0
"  Reimagining Urban Living  In a rapidly urbanizing world, the concept of car-free cities is emerging as a revolutionary approach to address the challenges of modern urban life. These cities advocate for a transformation in urban planning, where private automobiles are restricted or entirely absent, giving way to sustainable transportation options and more eco-friendly urban landscapes. This essay explores the idea of car-free cities, emphasizing their potential benefits, challenges, and solutions.  Car-free cities represent a paradigm shift in urban living, focusing on sustainability, health, and community well-being:  By significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a significant role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, making them key players in the fight against climate change.  Emphasizing pedestrian and cyclist safety leads to fewer accidents and an overall improved state of public health, with decreased air pollution levels contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being.  Efficient use of urban space is a central theme in car-free cities, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Less reliance on private cars translates to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and lower stress levels for urban inhabitants.  Car ownership can be an expensive endeavor. By depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  Transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges:  Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a loss of personal freedom.  Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact.  Redesigning urban areas for car-free living is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  Solutions for successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthwhile aspiration. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where car-free initiatives have been successful in reducing emissions, congestion, and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By limiting or eliminating car usage, these communities have created more sustainable and livable environments.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to these emissions, accounting for up to 12 percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and even higher percentages in some areas of the United States. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen a significant decrease in emissions due to its strict car-free policy. Similarly, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog caused by car emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these communities are taking a proactive approach in combating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in congestion. In Paris, the driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion in the city. Bogota also implemented a car-free day, which left the streets empty of traffic jams. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and public transit, these communities have been able to alleviate congestion and create a more efficient transportation system.

Additionally, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative forms of transportation. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and many residents have sold their cars to move there. This has resulted in a focus on public transportation and walking or biking, as these are the primary modes of transportation in the community. Similarly, Bogota's car-free day has encouraged millions of people to take buses, bikes, or walk to work. By limiting car usage, these communities have made a conscious effort to promote a more sustainable and active lifestyle.

While there may be some challenges and adjustments associated with limiting car usage, such as lost revenue for delivery companies and exceptions for certain vehicles, the overall benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. The reduction in emissions, congestion, and promotion of alternative transportation create more sustainable and livable communities. As more cities and communities adopt car-free initiatives, it is clear that limiting car usage is a step in the right direction towards a greener and more efficient future.",1
"Cars may actually disappear from the modern world humans live in. Cars sales are decreasing, and fewer cars actually are a benefit by making the air cleaner and making traffic and travel time faster.

Pollution is one issue that people have been trying to limit for years now. One way people can reduce emissions is to stop using their car. According to Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer , pollution in Paris drastically decreased after driving bans were implemented. The ban on driving cleared up enough smog, that the French government was able to rescind the ban. Across the globe, transportation is America's second largest source of emissions and pollution as explained in The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Rosenthal explains how that the decreasing number of cars on the roads in America will help the environment and decrease carbon emissions. Car emissions may be the largest form of pollution in America, but the percentage in American cities where most people are found has a drastically higher amount of emissions. Both Duffer and Rosenthal show that automobile decreases lead to pollution decreases as well. Cars limitations will lead to greener grasses and bluer skies.

Traffic is a problem that most people experience during their daily travels, whether its going to school or work. Limiting cars will lower traffic in cities everywhere. Shown in In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal , the city of Vauban, Germany has stores placed a walk away instead of far away in malls. Vauban has its stores located closer, which will be easier to access to citizens, instead of waiting on a highway with a traffic jam. Also in Bogota, Columbia, car and rush hour restrictions have drastically lowered traffic time, as well as opened bike lanes for a new means of transportation, according to Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky. New bike lanes and sidewalks open up a new way to travel, distributing people between two ways of transportation instead of cramming everyone onto one highway. 118 miles of bike lanes have been built in Bogota and hopefully in new places too, to lower traffic and transportation time. Car limitations will lead to a quicker way to get to the place you want to be at, instead of waiting in a line full of automobiles.

Cars are disappearing anyways, due to culture and people being happier.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal shows how people in the city feel about the restrictions on cars. Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Walter is joyful now that car limitations were implemented. Rosenthal explains the stressfree life in Vauban, with its children playing and riding bikes in the outdoors. This happy life may actually be shaping citizens of America due to its decrease in car purchases, and license decreases.

The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal explains that the peak of driving was at 2005, and now people are going through a longterm cultural shift. Driving decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 in younger people. People are not buying cars, because they do not need them. Car limitations may not even be needed due to happier people and the downfall of driving.

Cars are dissapearing due to limitations, and that is a great thing. Less cars means less pollution and traffic, along with happier people and a carfree culture. A better environment and a faster way to travel, will result in joyous people.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both the environment and individuals. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" car usage is responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the US, this number can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can make a significant impact in reducing these emissions and combating climate change.

One example of a car-free community is the Vauban district in Germany. In this experimental neighborhood, residents are not allowed to have cars, except for a few designated parking areas outside the community. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars when they moved there. According to one resident, Heidrun Walter, giving up her car has made her much happier and less tense. This suggests that limiting car usage can also improve individual well-being.

The movement to limit car usage is not limited to Germany. In the US, organizations like Transportation for America are advocating for new communities that are less dependent on cars. The Environmental Protection Agency is also promoting ""car reduced"" communities. These efforts recognize the need to shift away from a car-centric lifestyle and embrace alternatives like public transportation and walking. By changing how we think about transportation, we can create more compact and accessible suburban areas with fewer parking spaces and more walkable communities.

Paris has also taken steps to limit car usage due to smog. In Robert Duffer's article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" it is mentioned that after a period of intense smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban. Only cars with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates were allowed to be driven on certain days. This ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped alleviate the smog problem. This example shows that limiting car usage can have immediate positive effects on air quality.

Another successful initiative is the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, as described in Andrew Selsky's article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" For this event, cars are banned from the streets, and people are encouraged to use alternative modes of transportation like biking, walking, or taking public buses. Millions of Colombians participated in this initiative, leading to empty streets and reduced traffic congestion. The day without cars is part of a larger improvement campaign in Bogota, which has seen the construction of bicycle paths, improvements to sidewalks, and restrictions on rush-hour traffic.

The decreasing interest in car ownership among the younger generation is indicative of a larger cultural shift towards alternative modes of transportation. According to a study mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""The End of Car Culture,"" driving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. This trend is influenced by various factors, including the rise of technologies like the internet and car-pooling apps, as well as a renewed interest in city living. Young people today prioritize convenience, connectivity, and environmental impact over car ownership.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing car dependency, we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and more walkable communities. The success of car-free initiatives around the world, such as those in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, demonstrates the potential for a cultural shift away from car-centric lifestyles. The younger generation's decreasing interest in car ownership further supports the need for alternative transportation options. It is clear that limiting car usage is not just beneficial for the environment but also for individual well-being and the overall livability of urban areas.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear as cities and communities around the world experiment with new approaches to transportation. One such example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where cars are not allowed on the streets except for a few designated areas. This experiment has led to numerous benefits for the residents, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a sense of community and livability.

According to an article in the New York Times, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities like Vauban can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. The article also mentions that Vauban's streets are peaceful and quiet, with the swish of bicycles and the sound of children playing replacing the noise of car engines.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris, for example, implemented a partial driving ban during a period of smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. The ban targeted even-numbered license plates one day and odd-numbered plates the next, and nearly 4,000 drivers were fined for violating the ban. While there were complaints from delivery companies about lost revenue, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers.

Another example of the benefits of limiting car usage can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, which has implemented a car-free day for the past three years. This day encourages alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation. The event has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. Other cities in Colombia have also joined in the event, and municipal authorities from other countries have come to witness and learn from the event.

The end of car culture is predicted by many experts, as Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend has environmental implications as transportation is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. With advancements in technology and changes in behavior, people are finding alternative means of getting around, such as telecommuting, shared van services, and bike-sharing programs. The decrease in driving by young people is particularly notable, with studies showing a 23 percent decrease between 2001 and 2009.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a shift towards a more sustainable and livable environment. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show that it is possible to create thriving communities without cars, and that alternative modes of transportation can be successful and beneficial. As we continue to prioritize the environment and seek ways to reduce our carbon footprint, limiting car usage is a significant step in the right direction.",1
"Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling has started to become obsolete.

As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistent, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives susceptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" says a member of the carfree community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager ages 1620 resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.

Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millennia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by threequarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.

In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly ""Carfree day"" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.

Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millennials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in suburban areas. This concept, known as smart planning, aims to separate suburban life from automobile use in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more compact and accessible communities. The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various examples around the world, such as the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars and enjoy a more peaceful and happy lifestyle. Additionally, the city of Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat severe smog, resulting in reduced congestion and improved air quality. Moreover, Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day, which not only reduced traffic jams, but also generated a revolutionary change in transportation habits. These examples highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including reduced emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By decreasing the reliance on cars in suburban areas, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate severe smog, as seen in Paris, where a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. These examples demonstrate that by limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improved accessibility to alternative transportation options. In the German suburb of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and the community has implemented a car-free policy in most areas. This has led to the development of walkable streets, bike paths, and an efficient public transportation system. By creating communities that are more accessible to public transportation and less dependent on cars, we can reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainable and convenient travel options. This is evident in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event promoted alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, and taking buses, and showcased the potential for a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to improve quality of life for individuals. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. They enjoy quieter and more peaceful streets filled with the sounds of bicycles and children playing. By reducing car dependency, individuals can experience a more connected and vibrant community, as seen in Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, instead of being located in distant malls along highways. This not only promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, but also supports local businesses and fosters a sense of community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to alternative transportation options, and an improved quality of life for individuals. Examples from Germany, Paris, and Bogota have shown the positive impact of limiting car usage, leading to cleaner and healthier communities, reduced congestion, and more vibrant and connected neighborhoods. As we continue to face the challenges of climate change and urbanization, limiting car usage should be considered as a smart planning approach to create sustainable and livable communities.",1
"A decline in the use of motor vehicles would greatly help the whole world in many unique ways. Most importantly, cars have an awful effect on the environment. Eliminating motor vehicles all together would remove many of the pollutants effecting the environment. Also, removing cars has a great effect on the community as well by helping places to grow and prosper. Finally, the thought of limiting car usage is trending rapidly with the common man as well as higher ups in the government.

Cars produce up to 12% of Europe's greenhouse gases and up too 50% of America's greenhouse gas. High levels of greenhouse gas absorb heat and prevent it from leaving Earth's atmosphere causing a rise in temperature better known as global warming. Second, the carbon monoxide and other noxious chemicals that are released by vehicles can come together to form a thick smog. This somg is very bad for people's health and can contaminate land and water with toxic chemicals. In order to prevent these two things a lack of usage of cars is necessary in today's world.

Just like the environment, reduced car usage also can benefit your very own community. Citizens reported being ""much happier this way"" as well as being less tense after restrictions on cars were imposed. Second, a lack of car usage would cause much denser cities. In turn, business that were staged on highways would become local and city centers would allow friends to live close by. Finally, in cities that imposed bans on motor vehicles parks and sports centers were not only revived but began to completely flourish.

Finally, laws about car usage are smiled upon by both pedestrians but by people in legislative positions. Fist off, European places like Switzerland and France first adopted these types of rules. As a result, events like car free day in Bogota became a big success with many supporters. Therefore, even president Barack Obama revealed a plan to be imposed that limits the usage of cars in America. Finally, sociological professors like Mimi Sheller have noticed people accepting and embracing the new anti car policies.

In turn, restricting car usage has nothing but good to offer the majority of cities. From helping reduce the global problem of polution. Or, helping to build bigger more tightly knit cities. The new very popular laws will be imposed in many european countries and sonn the U.S. As a result, the positive effects will be embraced by communities for generations to come.",0
"The Electoral College should remaining our countries voting system when deciding whom the president of the United States will be. The Electoral College is a process our founding fathers established as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote made by citizens Source 1, paragraph 1. Citizens elect electors who will then elect the president. This system is affective in many ways and shall not be abolished. These electors are conscious of every decision they make when deciding on our president and are here to look at things we may overlook. They are here to help us make the most affective decision. adderall, this is an enormous decision. It is the decision of whom the president of our country will be.

The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President Source 1, paragraph 3. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment."" This lists the candidates whom ran for president in your state and the names of their respective electors. It is a well organized and thoughtout process. This process helps us make the best decision as a country on whom our future president will be.

In source 2, paragraph 13, it states ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in."" Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.

In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, also in source 3 it states how there is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.

The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject. The Electoral College is the wisest process we can use in electing our presidents.",0
"Cars most people use them for transportation. It's our lazy way of getting to places.

Automobiles benefit us plenty when it comes to getting from point A to point B, but they also have a big negative impact. Cars are responsible for a huge amount of pollution like greenhouse gas emissions and smog. If we were to limit car usage, we could decrease the amount of stress and pollution emitted into the air, as well as give our community a chance to improve.

In Vauban, Germany, residents have given up their cars and have no problem doing so. Cars are generally not allowed, forbidden some would say, in this district. vaughn's streets are pretty much ""carfree"". Of course car ownership is still allowed, with the exception that you have to be able to find a place to park since there are only two places large garages at the end of the development, where a carowner can buy a space for 40,000, along with a home. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Heidrun Walter stated, a mother of two. Experts say automobiles are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Paris participated in a driving ban, which violators suffered a fine of 22euro31. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, for example, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter while Brussels had 114 PM and 79.7 PM in London. Since Paris participated in this ban, 60 percent of Paris' smog has cleared.

In Bogota, Columbia, the city held a carfree day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third year in a row cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted to this Day Without Cars. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog as well. Violators here faced 25 fines. Even with occasional bad weather, people still participated in this event. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man, as he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife. The Day Without Cars allowed parks and sports centers to bloom, uneven sidewalks to be replaced wih broad smooth sidewalks, new restaurants and upscale shopping districs to crop up, and rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In the United States, Americans are starting to buy fewer cars, drive less, and get fewer licenses as each year passes partially because cashstrapped Americans couldn't afford new cars. If this pattern continues, which many sociologists believe, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment. Even though reducing automobile transportation could have negative implications for car industries, the positive affects are much more important. In this generation, the internet allows people to connect without having to drive to meet friends. At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedesrtian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" In conclusion, cars are starting to be less and less of a neccesity, and more and more people are starting to notice that automobiles are just hurting the enviornment. By limiting car use, it can limit stress, help the enviornment as well as communities to improve, save time, conserve resources and improvee safety. There are plenty of other ways to get transportation that are less damaging and dangerous, like bicycles and walking. Of course it may take a little longer to get places without a car, but you can always ride a bus, or enjoy the scenery while riding a bike or walking.",0
"Dear State Senator, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidential candidates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicans. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote.

For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backing 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the electoral votes on the winnertakeall basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states.

Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themselves have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opportunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successes in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates.

Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do.

Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose. In the beginning in starting the Electoral College was held by our founding fathers of this great nation. There for this methodshouldremain as it should. Thank you for your consideration.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become so ingrained in our society that it may seem impossible to imagine life without them. However, there are several advantages to limiting car usage that are becoming increasingly apparent. This essay aims to inform fellow citizens about the benefits of reducing our reliance on cars. By examining examples from different cities around the world, we can see that limiting car usage can have positive effects on the environment, public health, and overall quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Environmental Benefits

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. The burning of fossil fuels in cars contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major cause of global warming. In Europe, passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In some car-intensive areas of the United States, this number can rise to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 5). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to a cleaner and healthier planet.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Public Health

Limiting car usage also has significant benefits for public health. The smog and pollution caused by car emissions have been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Duffer, 16). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and reduce the incidence of these health problems. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages people to engage in physical activity such as walking or biking, which has numerous health benefits. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day resulted in millions of people biking, hiking, and using public transportation to get to work, leading to a temporary decrease in smog and traffic jams (Selsky, 21-24). Encouraging more active modes of transportation can help combat the sedentary lifestyles that contribute to obesity and other health issues.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Quality of Life

Limiting car usage can also improve the overall quality of life for citizens. In many cities, the layout of suburbs has been centered around cars, leading to long commutes, traffic congestion, and urban sprawl. By adopting a more compact and walkable approach to urban planning, we can create communities that are more accessible and enjoyable for residents. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, is a prime example of this concept. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and pedestrian-friendly environment, where the sound of bicycles and children playing replaces the noise of engines (Rosenthal, 3). This shift in focus from cars to people can lead to safer streets, stronger communities, and a better overall quality of life.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage offers a multitude of advantages that range from environmental benefits to improved public health and enhanced quality of life. The success stories of cities like Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia demonstrate the positive impact of reducing our reliance on cars. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is crucial for citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that limit car usage in order to build a better world for ourselves and future generations.",1
"Cars have been an important part of transportation in society for many years. However, in some communities that is changing. Many young people are not getting their licenses and some are giving up their cars. The streets of Vauban, Germany, are mainly ""carfree"" and the suburb only has two places to park cars, at the expense of 40,000. Limiting car usage results in many advantages.

One of those advantages is helping the environment. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer explains Paris, France, put a driving ban into effect because of smog rivaling that of Beijing, China. The ban was based on license plate number, only allowing certain numbers to drive on specific days. Eventually the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough. Limiting the number of people that used their cars resulted in cleaner air, which is healthier for everyone. If limits were put into effect into other places, that could reduce air pollution, helping the environment. Americans are also buying fewer cars and driving less than previous years. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says, ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". That is another example of environmental benefits from limiting car use. By utilizing other forms of transportation, the impact a person has on the environment is greatly reduced.

Another advantage that comes from limiting car use is lower stress and better mental health. In the suburb of Vauban, Germany, fiftyseven percent of families sold their cars to move there and seventy percent do not own cars. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". By not owning a car, a person has less stress and can relax when traveling. There is probably less focus needed when traveling without a car because there is no worry about other drivers. Bogota, Colombia has started the Day Without Cars, the goal being to promote alternate transportation. Violaters recieve fines of twentyfive dollars. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". People could enjoy the outdoors, without the constant noise and pollution from traffic in the city. That could lower their stress and increase their happiness.

Limiting car use has many advantages, some of which are helping the environment and lowering stress. Some suburbs, specifically Vauban, Germany, are mostly ""carfree"". A trend of buying fewer cars and driving less is also growing in America, which is beneficial to the environment. Plus, the stress of driving a car is taken away when their use is limited.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent as the negative effects of car dependency become more evident. By adopting a car-free lifestyle, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease congestion, and improve air quality. Vauban, Germany, is a prime example of a car-free community that has experienced these benefits. With restricted car ownership and limited parking spaces, Vauban has been able to achieve a high percentage of residents living without cars. Similar initiatives are taking place in other parts of the world, including the banning of cars in Paris during periods of high pollution and the implementation of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. These examples demonstrate the success and growing popularity of limiting car usage.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, communities can make a significant contribution to reducing these emissions. For example, in Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, the streets are noticeably quieter and less polluted. This not only benefits the environment but also improves the overall quality of life for residents.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage also helps decrease congestion in cities. The passage mentions that congestion in Paris was down 60 percent after the partial driving ban was enforced due to smog. This reduction in congestion leads to shorter travel times and a smoother flow of traffic. Furthermore, decreasing the number of cars on the road can also result in safer streets and fewer accidents. With fewer cars to navigate, pedestrians and cyclists have more space and are less likely to be involved in collisions.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passage states that the smog in Paris during the partial driving ban rivaled that of Beijing, which is known for its severe pollution. By reducing the number of cars emitting harmful pollutants, communities can breathe cleaner air and reduce the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In Bogota, Colombia, the car-free day resulted in streets devoid of traffic jams and the opportunity for residents to engage in alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking public transit. This not only improved air quality but also promoted healthier lifestyles by encouraging physical activity.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for communities. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease congestion, and improve air quality. The success of car-free communities such as Vauban, as well as initiatives like the driving bans in Paris and car-free days in Bogota, demonstrate the positive impact of reducing dependence on cars. By adopting these measures and promoting alternative modes of transportation, societies can create more sustainable and livable communities for the benefit of all.",1

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of maintaining this system rather than switching to a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing the information provided in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner, dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all method most states employ creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in each state, thus minimizing the chances of an inconclusive outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation and prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning particular regions. Without the Electoral College, candidates would only need to mobilize support in densely populated areas, such as major cities, and could afford to overlook the concerns and interests of less populated regions. The requirement for a candidate to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters across different states ensures that they consider the needs of the nation as a whole.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. Swing states have the potential to decide the outcome of an election, leading candidates to campaign heavily in these states and provide more information and attention to their voters. This not only increases voter engagement but also allows for a more thoughtful selection of the president by swing state voters who are likely to be well-informed about the candidates and their policies.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores a balance for large states in the political process. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states have fewer seats relative to their populations. The Electoral College grants larger states with more electoral votes, thus giving them more influence in the election process compared to smaller states. This ensures that their issues and concerns are adequately addressed by presidential candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, which may complicate the election process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This prevents the necessity for additional rounds of voting and guarantees a decisive result.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as its potential to discourage voters in states where a particular party is unlikely to win, it is important to note that this has not significantly impacted voter turnout in presidential elections. The majority of individuals who vote in the United States do so to express their political preference rather than with the expectation that their vote will solely determine the outcome of the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, as a compromise between a vote in Congress and a popular vote, plays a crucial role in our democratic process. It ensures certainty in outcomes, encourages candidates to address the needs of the entire nation, gives due attention to swing states, grants larger states a fair share of influence, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope you will consider my perspectives and continue to support what I believe is a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"I write this to the Senator of Florida.

Every four years a president is elected to become what is the Commander and Chief and sole representative of the United States of America. Because we as a country are a democracy, ""the people"" get to choose the president. We go every four years, starting at the age of 18 and so on, to vote or to choose who we want to represent us as Americans. Who we want to run this country. Who we want to lead us both to success and trust that they will do all in their power to keep us safe. But are we, the people, really choosing who we want? Just like President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO, I believe that we are not choosing at all but we are voting for a state of electors, who in turn choose a president for us.

The electoral college is very unfair to voters.""according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore_ thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election...voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong By: Bradford Plumber If you wanted to vote for a specific president you would have to elect the state electors pledged to that president and hope they pick them. At times the electors have the right idea and other times the electors get confused and choose the wrong person. Other times the elector could even be biased or even racist in rare cases, and choose the one person that you do not see running this country.

""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During The 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is, because the electors are the ones that choose. The candidates don't even attempt to campaign in places they know they wont get a vote on. The candidates will try to win over the bigger states first to gain more electoral votes to win.

I see the electoral college as an unfair way for the people to vote for president. If we are truley a democracy, then we should change from using the electoral college to the use of popular vote, or direct election.",0
"Living in a community without the use of cars can be extremely beneficial. It might seem odd to say such an idea because we have lived in towns with lot of car usage all of our lives. Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car can be very stresses. This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it such as oil changes and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive.

Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the environment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This number keeps on climbing because more and more people are buying cars which just puts more gas into the environment.

An even greater benefit of living in a community without cars is that you can get more exercise. Sitting in the car everyday going to and from work for 2 hours is not being productive. However, in the existing carfree communities, all the necessary store are in walking or biking distance from the majority of the population. So, the commute to work for most people can be just like getting a daily exercise and staying in shape.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that living in a community without cars would be a change for the better. It would help with everyones financial situations and everyone would have better health because you would have to bike and walk everywhere. As of lately, it has seemed like less and less people have started to use cars. The number of miles drivn peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since. In April, 2013 the average number of miles driven was 9 percent below the peak in 2005.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing trend to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative forms of transportation. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving public health and creating more accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and mitigating their effects on climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. As the number of cars on the road decreases, so does air pollution, which has been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, by promoting alternative forms of transportation such as walking and cycling, we can encourage a more active lifestyle and improve overall public health.

Limiting car usage can also create more accessible and sustainable communities. Instead of relying on personal vehicles, smart planning focuses on creating compact communities that are designed to be easily navigable by foot or public transport. This approach allows for the placement of essential amenities, such as shops and services, within walking distance, reducing the need for long-distance car travel to meet everyday needs. By making communities more compact and accessible, we can reduce sprawl and preserve green spaces.

Moreover, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion, particularly in densely populated areas. By promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, carpooling, and biking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and ease congestion. This not only reduces travel times for individuals but also improves overall traffic flow in cities.

While the idea of limiting car usage may seem daunting to some, it is a necessary step towards creating more sustainable and livable communities. Initiatives such as car-free days and the promotion of alternative forms of transportation have already shown promising results in various parts of the world. By embracing smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can make significant strides towards a greener and more sustainable future.",1
"Limiting car usage has several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This practice has been adopted by various communities around the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia. These communities have implemented measures to separate suburban life from the use of cars, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. By limiting car usage, these communities have reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased traffic congestion, and promoted healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.

One of the major benefits of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, they contribute to 12 percent of these emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the number goes up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, as demonstrated in Vauban and Paris, these communities have successfully reduced their carbon footprint and contributed to the fight against climate change. This is crucial in the face of the global environmental crisis.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can effectively decrease traffic congestion in suburban areas. Suburbs are often heavily dependent on cars, leading to congested roads and long commuting times. However, by implementing measures like car-free zones and promoting alternative transportation options, such as walking, biking, and public transport, communities can alleviate this problem. Vauban, for example, has shown that by limiting cars and promoting cycling and walking, the community has created a peaceful and traffic-free environment, allowing residents to enjoy the true essence of suburbia.

In addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. The availability of public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in these communities encourages people to rely less on cars and engage in more physical activities. This promotes exercise, reduces sedentary behavior, and improves overall health and well-being. Studies have shown that people who walk or bike for transportation have lower rates of obesity and chronic diseases compared to those who rely solely on cars. By limiting car usage, communities are not only promoting a cleaner environment but also prioritizing the health and well-being of their residents.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, decreases traffic congestion, promotes healthier lifestyles, and creates more sustainable environments. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that implementing measures to separate suburban life from the use of cars can lead to positive outcomes. It is crucial for more communities to adopt these practices in order to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.",1
"I wholeheartedly believe the United States should keep the electoral College because the people voting are more legit, the voters are more educated in government topics than most, and citizens still have a say in the vote. Some citizens need to realize that electing a president is a big deal. Electors have more knowledge than most citizens about those government choices and which is best for The United States. Just because it says a citizen is qualified to vote does not always mean that person is making the correct decision. The electoral college electors uses their votes on legit reasons and what can benefit their country.

Electoral College is the way to go because the people voting are more legit. These Electors see what the people who are running for president and vice president have to offer. If they feel it is more beneficial than what the other presidentvice president has to offer, they will vote for that president. Most citizens understand what the president and vice president is trying to do for their country but the other citizens who are only voting because they can, do not. These citizens still effect the elect of the president and vice president and that's why the electoral college is a must have.

Electors are usually more educated in government topics than most citizens. The electors are people from the House of Representatives and Senators also. For those Representatives and those Senators to get there, they study about the United States and it's government. When Presidents and Vice presidents state what they are willing to do for the country, those electors know if it is appropriate and necessary and which one makes more sense or benefits the country more than the other. Not that Citizens would understand the best choice for the country but more likely than not an electors would make a more educated choice than a citizen would.

Even though the electors are voting, Citizens vote still count and matter. Citizens vote for the elector who is voting for the president that the citizens wants to vote for. A citizen can vote for a certain amount of electors who pledged to vote for the desired President and Vice President. If those electors won the statewide election, that desired President and Vice president would get those certain amount of electoral votes. It all depends on the citizens to choose the electors and whoever gets the majority vote, gets the electoral votes.

In Conclusion, the electoral college definitely should stay and help choose the better President and Vice President. The electors have a more legit reason to their choice than most citizens voting, since the electors are based on Representatives and Senators, they are more educated in that government matter, and even though it is electoral votes, the citizens vote count and matter. Without the electoral college, citizens who voted for a president can lose because the people who voted for the other president didn't think about the advantage and disadvantage of that president. Even if it was the better choice, the president can have ideas that don't benefit the voter. Electoral college who be kept and help all citizens choice the more reliable President and Vice President.",0
"  A Sustainable Vision for Urban Development  In an age characterized by rapid urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as an innovative approach to address the complex challenges of modern urban life. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making room for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"There was a time when cars were a new invention that everyone wanted or needed, but as of recent years cars have found themselves on the decline. There are many speculated reasons as to why people aren't as interested in getting a car and driving themselves around. One of the main theories seems to be that with new technological advancements are making carpools simple organize and knowing when and where the closest city bus will arrive easier to find out. Also, the technology of today makes it easy to contact and feel connected with your friends without having to go out and see them. Whatever the reason may be, the decline in car usage is a great advantage worldwide. The benefits of limited car usage are a better environment, less traffic stress, and healthier people.

Cars are the second most common source of air pollution in the United States. In Paris, cars were so heavily used that their pollution levels were near those of Beijing, China known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. When Parisians heard this, they took action right away. They rotated day long bans on personal cars with even numbered license plates and odd numbered licence plates. After about a week of this rotating ban, with a few exceptions, the smog levels had lowered enough that all cars could be allowed again. Luckily, this experience made the people of Paris realize how much cars were harming their environment. Cars are a large source of carbon emissions all over the world so lessening their use is essential to reviving our hurting environment.

Another advantage to limiting the use of cars is less traffic and less accidents. Public transportation drivers are more skilled and practiced than everyday drivers. Arguably, they are safer behind the wheel than your average citizen. In addition to that, having less cars on the road makes it safer to walk, bike, skateboard, or even rollerblade to your destination. Also, less cars means less traffic. Although on public transportation there are bus stops and such, traffic jams would be nearly eradicated if there were that many less cars on the road.

The last important advantage of having fewer cars is a personal health benefit. Driving can be seen as stressful. You have your life as well as the lives of people around you in your hands. Not only can the concept of driving itself be stressful, but things such as reckless drivers and heavy traffic are very hard for people to deal with patiently and safely. It would be better for people's emotional health to not have to deal with driving. Avoiding cars is also better for people's physical health in both cleaner environments and more physical activity. With the lessened levels of polution, as mentioned before, people would have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier environment to live in. The amount of physical activity in citizens would also increase. With people being able to walk, bike, skateboard, etc. to their desired destination the obesity numbers would decrease. Without cars, people's emotional and physical health would largely improve.

Overall, limiting the global use of cars would greatly benefit people worldwide. Due to the recent spread of the idea of being carfree and more concious of our environment pollution levels are already decreasing. Advantages coming from a much needed decreae in car usage also include safer roads and less stressed, healthier people. A decline in the number of personal vehicles on the road would lead to a happier, safer, and healthier world.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a crucial and fair method of ensuring a balanced representation of the American people in the presidential election process.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a popular vote and electing the President by a vote in Congress. As outlined in The Office of the Federal Register's text, the process consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, as well as the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures that each state has a say in the election, with the number of electors being directly proportional to the state's representation in Congress.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because a winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is almost always greater than their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state also leads to a landslide electoral vote victory, giving a clear indication of the people's choice.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. This prevents candidates with only regional support from being elected, promoting a president who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Additionally, swing states play a significant role in the electoral process, attracting candidates to campaign and engage with voters in those states. This results in more thoughtful voters who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, consequently making an informed decision.

Another vital aspect is that the Electoral College restores balance to the political power distribution between large and small states. As Judge Posner indicates, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from candidates during campaigns, ensuring that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. This consideration for both large and small states is crucial for maintaining a fair and equal representation of all Americans in the electoral process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections, as pointed out by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the potential complications associated with run-off elections and ensures a decisive outcome.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may limit voter participation in states where a particular candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to emphasize that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express their political preferences, as Judge Posner highlights. The continuation of the Electoral College recognizes the reality that no single vote will swing a national election and that voters participate to have their voices heard, regardless of the electoral outcome in their state.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains an essential system for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a fair representation of all citizens, guarantees a clear and decisive outcome, and maintains balance between large and small states. While recognizing the need for improvements in our electoral process, I firmly believe that abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the principles on which it was established. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our current system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the benefits of the Electoral College and the potential consequences of abandoning it. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this important issue.

Yours sincerely,

"Dear State Senator of Florida, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been a huge part of America since our founding fathers, who established this process. This process helps keep America in order in and in line. Where would our country be without it? We would be lost and confused with no direction to follow. The Electoral College helps keep America's voting process organized, which is key to a well functioning country. Which is why I believe that we should absolutely keep the Electoral College so that our voting process stays organized and because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning.

I believe we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning. Our founding fathers were the ones the establish the Electoral College which means it has been around since the beginning of our country. We should not change this tradition of America because it has seemed to kept us running smoothly for this long so why would we want to change that for no reason? If we stopped this tradition and changed it to all popular vote from citizens we would be hurting America in a huge way. It would completely change our ways of thinking, living, and running of America. Yes, a lot has changed in America since our founding fathers and yes change is sometimes for the better in our country because things are obviously different now then what they were 200 years ago but change would not be for the better in this situation. Let's say your grandmother, Mr. Senator, has had a peach cobbler recipe in your family for ages and it just takes your breath away with all the flavor and its divine taste, but this recipe is very old. If your grandmother's old recipe taste so delicious you would not want to change one thing about that recipe. Well same with the Electoral College. Its extremely old but it has also kept our country running well and has not failed us yet so we should not change this process just like you would not want to change your grandmothers peach cobbler recipe. This is why I think we should keep the Electoral College because it has kept us going since the beginning and you do not change something just because it is old or thought of being outdated.

Voting for someone to be the head and leader of an organization is an extremely big deal, especially when that organization is a country with laws, citizens, and many other important topics. America needs to have a president willing to stand up for what is right, be there for his people, and run America in a smooth and organized fashion. If the elections were based upon popular vote then imagine what could happen, someone running for president could act like a person who is willing to take on the huge responsibility and stand up for what is right, but when everyone votes for him and they get into office then they turn into a total coward and someone not determined enough to take on the responsibility or take on America. With Electoral College those running for president are also being voted on by Congress and qualified citizens. This makes things run much more smoothly because citizens are still getting to put there two cents in but only if they are qualified which is much more reasonable. Citizens are a huge part of America, they have a lot to do with America running smoothly or not, which is why they should have a say in who runs their country, but no so much of a say that its unorganized and completely on their own opinion. I mean lets face it, us citizens have our flaws and dont always make the best decisions or have the best opinions. Having qualified citizens voting and Congress members voting make it much more understandable. Most Congress members will have been in Office for a very long time which makes them wiser and better to understand the whole voting process, the way America runs, and laws. Most will be able to pick out the better qualities for president out of each of the members running for president. This is why I belive we should keep the Electoral College because it keeps voting organized.

The Electoral College is what keeps our voting process in order. When something gets old you do not throw it away if it still is of good use for you and the Electoral College is definetly still in good shape and is doing our country well so we should not change it because it has kept our country functioning from the beginning and so our voting process stays organized.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our society. In recent years, there has been a growing movement to separate suburban life from auto use, known as ""smart planning."" This movement acknowledges that automobiles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage, we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

One successful example of limiting car usage is the German suburb of Vauban. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, making the streets completely ""car-free"" except for the main thoroughfare with a tram to downtown Freiburg (Rosenthal, 2009). As a result of this car-free lifestyle, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal, 2009). The residents of Vauban have experienced the benefits of limiting car usage firsthand. They report feeling less stressed and happier without the constant reliance on cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life for individuals.

The benefits of limiting car usage are not limited to individual well-being. By reducing car dependency, we can also make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. Smart planning focuses on placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of distant malls accessed by highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This makes it easier for residents to rely on public transportation and encourages walking or cycling for short distances. Additionally, limiting car usage can address the issue of smog caused by car emissions. In cities like Paris, driving bans have been enforced during periods of intense smog to reduce air pollution (Duffer, 2014). These bans have seen a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels (Duffer, 2014). 

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have long-term benefits for our environment. A cultural shift towards reducing car ownership and driving has already been observed in the United States. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if it persists, will have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, making it crucial to limit car usage to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2013). 

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By focusing on smart planning and reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and combat climate change. The success stories of communities like Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of such measures. It is essential that we prioritize the development of car-reduced communities and encourage the adoption of alternative forms of transportation. The shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for our environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage in suburban areas can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This growing trend of car-free communities and car-reduced lifestyles can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more accessible and sustainable communities.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By adopting a low-car suburban lifestyle, like in the German community of Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, individuals can contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. This helps in the fight against climate change and the preservation of the environment.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris implemented a partial driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that reducing car usage can have immediate positive effects on air pollution levels. By promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, car-free communities like Vauban and car-free days like the one in Bogota can help improve air quality and create healthier environments for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote healthier lifestyles. In car-free communities, where walking and cycling are the primary means of transportation, residents are more physically active. This leads to improved health outcomes such as reduced risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and sedentary lifestyle-related conditions. By prioritizing pedestrian-friendly spaces and infrastructure, these communities create opportunities for residents to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, leading to healthier and more active lives.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By adopting a smart planning approach, which includes placing stores along walkable main streets instead of distant malls, communities can become more compact and easily accessible via public transportation. This reduces the need for extensive parking spaces and makes daily activities more convenient for residents. It also promotes a sense of community by creating shared spaces and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles, encouraging social interactions and connection among residents.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers a myriad of advantages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting healthier lifestyles and creating sustainable and accessible communities, the benefits of embracing car-free lifestyles are significant. As we continue to witness a shift in American behavior with fewer cars being bought and less driving occurring, it is important to recognize and support initiatives that limit car usage for the betterment of individuals and the environment.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can tackle issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health, and create more sustainable and accessible communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in car-intensive areas, we can significantly decrease these emissions. For instance, the German suburb of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free community where 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in cleaner air and less pollution for residents. Similarly, during a partial driving ban in Paris to combat smog, congestion decreased by 60% and pollution levels dropped. These examples show that limiting car usage can have a direct positive impact on the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The passage set highlights that car emissions contribute to poor air quality, leading to smog and respiratory issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and decrease health problems associated with pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participated by hiking, biking, or taking public transportation to work. This event showcased the potential for car-free initiatives to improve public health by reducing pollution levels and creating clean and breathable environments.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. The passage set mentions the concept of ""smart planning"" and creating compact suburbs that are designed to be less dependent on cars. This includes placing stores within walking distance, improving public transportation options, and reducing the amount of parking space. By implementing these changes, communities can become more walkable, reduce the need for car usage, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Vauban, Germany, is an example of a community that has adopted these principles and created a car-free environment. This has resulted in residents feeling happier and less stressed, as mentioned by a media trainer and mother of two in the passage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit society as a whole. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote public health. Additionally, creating communities that are less dependent on cars can lead to increased sustainability and accessibility. It is important for societies to embrace initiatives that encourage alternative forms of transportation and limit car usage in order to create a more sustainable and livable future.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its importance in preserving the integrity of our presidential elections. While there are arguments to be made for a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system and should be retained.

One of the primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps prevent disputes and challenges to the election results, ensuring a smooth transition of power. In an era where the country is already heavily divided along political lines, avoiding prolonged legal battles over election results is of utmost importance to maintaining political stability.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, requiring candidates to seek support from diverse parts of the country. By preventing candidates from solely focusing on highly populated areas, the Electoral College ensures that the interests and concerns of people from various regions are taken into account. This promotes a more balanced representation of the entire nation rather than catering only to the interests of densely populated areas.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method employed by the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states receive special attention from candidates, encouraging them to pay closer attention to the campaign. By giving swing state voters a greater say in the election, the Electoral College empowers the most thoughtful voters who are more likely to carefully consider the competing candidates' policies and proposals.

The Electoral College also helps to restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states may lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as Judge Richard A. Posner points out. The Electoral College allocates electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, ensuring that larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This balances the influence of smaller states, ensuring that their concerns are not overshadowed by those of larger ones.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the complexity and cost associated with conducting additional elections. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns of voter disenfranchisement and the possibility of the popular vote winner losing the presidency, these issues can be addressed through discussions on reforming the system rather than completely eliminating it. We should strive to explore potential modifications that can enhance its democratic nature, such as adopting a proportional allocation of electoral votes, as implemented in Maine and Nebraska.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served as the backbone of our presidential election process for centuries, striking a balance between democratic representation and regional interests. Rather than discarding it outright, I believe it is vital to explore ways to improve the system to address its shortcomings, while retaining its fundamental principles. I urge you to consider these arguments in favor of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing about your position on this critical issue.

Sincerely,

"In years past, the number of people interested in, and using cars around the world has dropped noticeably. A marked shift in the ""car culture of the world has occurred, leaving many wondering what is tocome. Limiting car usage has many positive aspects, such as saving money, that people tend to be less stressed when they do not drive as much, and reducing pollution and greenhouse emissions.

One of the many positive aspects of reducing car usage is that one will save money if ones car usage is reduced. In an article by Robert Duffer called ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says: ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were orderedto leave cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31."" In Paris, carowners were charged money for using cars on certain days. This was done in an effort to reduce traffic in the city. Another article that addresses this is ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal. She says: ""Part of teh explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" Cars are a costly thing, and many people cannot afford to put the money in to having and maintaining an automobile. Car cost so much,so reducing,or even eliminating usage will save anyone a great deal of money. This is one of the many advantages to limiting car usage.

Antoher reason to limit car usage is that people tend to be less stressed,and more happy when they do not have a car to worry about. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, she talks about Heidrun Walter, who say thatshe is actually much happier no w that she does not own a car,and that owning a car was very stressful. No one wants to be stressed,so why would people want to put themselves through the trouble of owning a car? Lowering car usage has been shown to reduce stress, which is a good thing for people, mentally and physically. Andrew Selsky also addressesthis in ""Carfree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" where he says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress.'"" As is outlined here, reducing car usage lowers stressing many people, which is definitely an advantage.

Reducing polution and greenhouse gas emissions is another advantage of limiting car usage. carscreated emissions dangerous to the environment, so reducing usage will have a positive effect on the environment. In ""Carfree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsky discusses the mayor of Bogota, colombians decision to have a day free of cars in the city. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In Bogota, as in most cities, smog from car pollution is widespread. Lowering car usage lowers the levels of polution and dangerous emissions in cities. A similar situation is outlined in Robert buffer's ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says ""After days of nearrecord polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This gives further evidence that reducing car usage will lower pollution and smog in cities around the world. Concurrently, Elizabeth Rosenthal, in her article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" she says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emisssions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" This provides further evidence that cars release an enormous amount of pollution, and usage must be lowered.

Limtiting ones car usage has many positive consequences, some of these include saving money, reducing stress, and lowering polution levels. These are all great reasons to limit car usage, and many people are beginning to take hold of these advantages around the world.",0
"Have you ever thought about what your life would be like without a car? May of us can't even seem to grasp the concept. So many America's are too dependant on their vehicles but, other placesacross the world such asGermany, Paris, and Bogota have began working on this new concept. I strongly support the idea of no car usage, just think of the benefits that could come from it, conservation of resources, lowered pollution,improved safety, and just think of all the money you would save without a car. The possibilities are endless.

Pollution and bad air are problems we face all around the world, and cars have much to do with it. ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" Source 4: The end of Car Culture. Intense pollution andbad health are problems that are faced all around the world, imagine the positive effects we would see not only in our environments but in our own selves if we stop car usage. We need to protect the world we live it by keeping it clean, also keep ourselves healthy in order for survival.

Many families lose loved ones every year due to vehicle related accidents, cars and traffic have a good percentages of deaths each year. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after fivedays"" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. congestion has to do with traffic, adults complain every day about traffic and how dangerous it is. ""It's a good was to take away stress"" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. We spend a lot of our lives stressing over many things, why add the stress of traffic and wrecks? We have many more important things to spend our time worrying about, we shouldn't stress over something that we can live without. Taking away vehicles would wipe out stress, traffic, and many deaths a year.

financial problems aren't a forgein subject. Almost everyone can recall a time in their life either when they were facing the problems themself or heard about a close friend or family member going through a tough time. ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" Source 1:In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Not only people but countries have been guilty of putting cars infront of other neccessities. Many young adults will base their finances around a car of their choice when we all know their are far more imporant bills to be paid. Also, with taking away the centering of cars we have time to face and solve more imporant issues. Taking out cars would give people a chance to get their priorities straight.

This is why I strongly support the idea of no cars, I see nothing but positive results that would come and many other would agree. Improved safety, lowered pollution,improved safety, and money savings are just the beginning. I understand most can't imagine life without their vehicle but change isn't always a bad thing, especially when there's many factors at stake.",0
"Living in a world covered in dark,suffocating smog is not the first thing that comes to mind when we imagine an ideal environment. The smog that hangs over our head at this very moment is an example of what humanity has contributed to this worlds health,disease. If we call this our home then we should find a suitable solution to provide a more stable condition of the Earth's wellbeing. Limiting car use is a universal solution in which countries across the globe are taking part of. It has been shown on numerous occasions that limiting car usage, or even going to the extreme of banning them, has created a stress free atmosphere, a healthier world, and has lead to economic growth.

The ""smart planning"" trend that has grown in popularity in the United States and Europe is a stepping stone to how we plan to stop the exaggerated use of cars. In Vauban, Germany with their 5,500 residents have made the ultimate sacrifice and have completly given up cars, besides the 40,000 parking spot you wish to obtain along with your house. A residence has remarked on how she was ""...happier this way than when she had a car,""that when she had a car she was ""always tense,"" not the exact response most people believe, yet eliminating that rushed environment has increased the supporters of anticars. businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza from Bogota, Columbia which has implemented an effective program that has banned the use of cars on certain days looks at this event as a ""good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" and as it has shown he seems to be right on that.

12% of the atmospher over Europe is made of of greenhouse gases while in a America, where car use is more frequent, in certain congested spots could be as high as 51%. Cars make an incredible barrier as to what we can achieve in environment conservation. On a Monday in Paris the city of lights the use of cars was banned by the government for the fog was at to of a horrendous state they needed to ""clear the air of a global city."" Even though on average the plague that is infesting the atmospher is approximately 147 micrograms of particulate matterPM per square meter, while in Brussels it is 114PM and in London 79.7, if this is what it is on average imagine how much worse it must've been to banish the use of cars to clear the air. Even though it seems to be quite a scarafice, as we see in Paris 4,000 people were fined for driving on that Monday and 27 of them had their cars impounded purely based on their reaction, we see a trend of the decresing intrest of buying and using cars anyway and after a point in time we see a posotive result in the long run. As Drexel University sociology professor puts it ""...we are witnessing a longterm cultural shift,"" as in relation to America one of the leaders in car production and passion. Preventing the use of cars will substantially help the environment, just that one day of a driving ban on Paris was able to let the smog clear up enought to allow driving the next day, I guess you can see those lights a little brighter now.

Part of the ""smart planning"" trend we are able to recognize is a need to aid in the effort to save our home. The fact it promotes healthy living and an increase in businesses in suburbs making tsuburbs more in touch with consumers needs as seen in Botoga where ""parks and sports centers have bloomed,"" and ,""new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up,"" it has morphed stressed societies into happier ones, and the potential to make for a better world is something undenyably needed in society today, a change to help us all.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps to cleanse the environment, saves citizens money, and can help with improving citizens health.

One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay 100500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional 100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from 3.006.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, heshe may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.

A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a winwin for everyone!

Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.",0

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue its use in electing the President of the United States. While some argue for the abolition of the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the current system provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the event of a dispute, it is less likely than in a popular vote system. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Although a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely. This level of certainty ensures that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the outcome of the election.

Another important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to multiple regions in order to be successful. This is crucial for a candidate to be an effective president, as it prevents them from favoring one region over others. It ensures that every region's interests are considered and prevents any region from feeling disenfranchised.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads to candidates focusing their campaign efforts on swing states. This means that voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates, making them the most thoughtful voters. It is important for these voters, who are likely to decide the election, to have a thorough understanding of the candidates' platforms and policies. This helps to ensure that the most informed voters have the greatest influence in choosing the president.

The Electoral College also provides balance to the political weight of each state, as it restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. The electoral votes awarded to each state are directly related to their population, which means that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This helps to ensure that the concerns and issues of both large and small states are addressed by candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This can greatly simplify the presidential election process and avoids the potential complications that come with run-off elections. Instead, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, ensuring a smooth transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides balance to the political weight of each state, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some may argue for a popular vote system, it is crucial to recognize the important benefits that the Electoral College offers. I believe that this system should be preserved in order to maintain an effective and fair method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my views into consideration and continue to support the Electoral College.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of the Electoral College and its role in the presidential election process. After carefully considering the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" and ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" I am convinced that there are valid arguments both in favor of keeping the Electoral College and for changing to a popular vote system.

Upon examining the information presented, it is clear that the Electoral College was established as a compromise between a congressional vote and a popular vote for the election of the President. The system involves electors who cast their votes on behalf of the voters in their respective states. However, the potential for problems in the Electoral College system is evident, as highlighted in the text by Bradford Plumer. Issues such as the possibility of faithless electors and the potential for ties in the electoral vote are concerning.

On the other hand, the text by Judge Richard Posner offers compelling reasons for retaining the Electoral College, particularly the certainty of outcome, the importance of trans-regional appeal, the focus on swing states, the representation of big states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. These practical reasons can help ensure a balanced and representative presidential election process.

Despite the issues raised about the Electoral College system, it is worth noting that it has been in place for centuries and has produced a stable political environment. Changing to a popular vote system would require extensive reforms in order to address the potential pitfalls associated with such a system. Additionally, as stated by Judge Posner, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in a way that ensures a broad appeal, preventing a situation where a candidate only focuses on specific regions or states.

In conclusion, I believe it is important to weigh the pros and cons of the Electoral College system carefully. While concerns exist regarding its fairness and potential for mishaps, the practical reasons provided by Judge Posner shed light on the positive aspects of the system. Perhaps a middle ground can be reached, where reforms are made to address the problems highlighted while still retaining the essential components of the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make informed decisions that will benefit the democratic process of our great nation.

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of maintaining this unique system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe the Electoral College is crucial in ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to when the popular vote is the determining factor. With almost all states awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, providing a clear and decisive result.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. As Posner states, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they need to gain support from various regions and take into account the interests of all Americans. This helps prevent candidates from focusing solely on populous areas or ignoring states with lower population densities. It ensures that the president represents the nation as a whole, avoiding a scenario where only certain states or regions receive attention and influence.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election outcome is less predictable. This forces candidates to address the specific concerns and needs of swing state voters, who are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and be informed about the competing candidates. By engaging with swing state voters, candidates have to appeal to a broader range of voters and address a wider range of issues, ultimately leading to better-informed decisions and policies.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives sufficient weight to large states, ensuring that they have a significant influence in the political process. Posner highlights that the popular vote in a large state like Florida can have a substantial impact through the allocation of electoral votes. This balances the power between large and small states, ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the biggest states and neglect the concerns of smaller states. This balanced approach allows for a more comprehensive representation of the diverse needs and interests of the American people.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of having run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In such a scenario, there would be pressure for further elections, which would complicate the presidential election process. By having the Electoral College, we ensure that a clear winner is determined in a timely manner, preventing any uncertainty or ambiguity in the election results.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in non-competitive states from participating, the fact remains that nearly half of the eligible American population still voted in the 2012 election, suggesting that voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that a single vote will decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process that has stood the test of time and has proven effective in providing a fair representation of the American people. It allows for certainty of outcome, ensures that every region's voice is heard, encourages candidates to engage with swing state voters, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections.

I would urge you to consider these points when discussing any potential changes to our electoral system. The Electoral College, while not perfect, is a valuable institution that upholds the principles of democracy and ensures a fair representation for all Americans.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"Dear state senator, I'm writing to you today regarding my concerns on our voting method for the president of the United States. Although we've been voting by the electoral college for how ever many years, I don't think it is the most efficient and fair way of voting. Our Chamber of Commerce, former vice president Richard Nixon and many more would have to agree with me when I say that abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us. The electoral college system is unfair, confusing and forces people to compromise.

The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote. One reason why America strives is the fact that we are a democracy, where every one gets a say and we are not ruled by a dictators or communist. The electoral college in no way follows our democratic system, the people are not voting for our president our electors are the ones voting for us.

Not only is the electoral college unfair but it is also confusing. For new voters they may be confused by the electoral college. New voters may wonder why can't I just vote for the candidate I most prefer. Think about it like this, in the electoral college the electors are the middle man. Why not cut the middle man out? And as a result make the voting system much simpler.

People may agrue that the electoral college system stops a majority vote. So let's say, you're a democrat living in the state of Texas with the electoral college system in place. You might as well not vote for an elector cause the majority of the people in texas are going to vote for the republican elector. On the other hand, there is the election by popular vote, gives everyone a say in whom they'd like to vote for. There is always the possibility of the disater factor.

After sharing my concerns with you state senator, I hope you understand where I am coming from.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage brings a multitude of advantages to society and the environment. As demonstrated in the passage set, there are many benefits to reducing our reliance on cars and finding alternative modes of transportation. 

One significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere, mitigating the effects of climate change.

Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to improved air quality. In the passage about Paris, it is mentioned that a partial driving ban was enforced due to intense smog. The article explains that cold nights and warm days caused car emissions to get trapped in the air. By limiting the number of cars on the road, we can prevent this accumulation of pollutants and improve the overall air quality in cities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier modes of transportation. The passage about Bogota highlights the success of a car-free day where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. Encouraging people to walk, bike, or use public transportation not only reduces congestion on the roads but also promotes physical activity, leading to healthier citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes how the suburb is designed without street parking, driveways, or home garages, encouraging residents to rely on public transportation. This type of smart planning not only reduces the need for large parking lots but also encourages the development of walkable neighborhoods with stores and amenities within walking distance. This creates vibrant communities where people can easily access what they need without relying on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to society and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, promotes healthier modes of transportation, and leads to more compact and accessible communities. By embracing alternative transportation options and rethinking our reliance on cars, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Most people have been riding in cars there whole life and never once rode a bus. Knowing that it is bad of our planet Earth and yet we still do. But there are places and people who gave up their cars, whether it was for ever or just for one day. Many of us know that cars are partly responsible for Global warming and pollution, they are responsible for 12 percent because of gas emissions. The most polluted city in the world is Beijing, China. To avoid having that title of cities decided to take action.

Cities like Mexico City, Paris, and bogotaColombia, have certain days a week when certain cars can not be driven due to pollution that it may cause. To enforce this rule citizens will be fined if driving a vehicle that is not corresponding that day. However, citizens do have many other forms of transportation that are economical, buses and taxis are still in service every single day. bogota has a population of 7 million, and they have a day called Day Without Cars that happens only once a year where absolutely no one is allowed to drive there own car with the exception of taxi and bus drivers. If you are found driving you will fined as well. Carlos Arturo Plaza claims that it is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution as he rode a twoseated bicycle with his wife paragraph 24, CarFree Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogota by Andrew Selsky. Recently two other Colombian Cities gave joined this Earth friendly event.

Vauban, Germany is a small town that is slowly growing because unlike most towns this one has no cars. There may be a few familys that own one car but they never use its only there for emergencys. In fact street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district paragraph 2, In German Sburd, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal. 70% of the familys do not own a car, and 57% sold a car to move there. The citizens claim that when they did have a car they are always tense but with this new life style they are much happier and stressfree.

We are witnessing a longterm cultural shift. Every year few and fewer citizens are geting their licenses and few cars are being bought paragraph 29, The End Of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal. It is now more common that many cannot afford a car because the prices are going up and you have to invest in it, plus carpool is very popular. This cultural shift will be good for everyone and good for our planet. We need to take a much care and give so much to it because this planet that we call Earth is the reason that we are here.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process and offers significant benefits.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential elections. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, ""The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winner of the Electoral College typically receives a higher share of the electoral vote compared to their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear mandate for the elected president and reduces the likelihood of disputes or uncertainty surrounding the election results.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it fosters the notion of ""everyone's president."" With its requirement of trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on winning particular regions. This ensures that the elected president represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous areas. By avoiding a situation where candidates can win the presidency by appealing only to specific regions, the Electoral College promotes the well-rounded leadership that our country needs.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. In his article, Judge Posner explains that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This forces candidates to listen to and engage with voters in these states, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. By giving swing states a significant role in deciding the election, the Electoral College ensures that the concerns and priorities of these crucial states are addressed.

Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for the inclusion of larger states in the presidential election process. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution means that larger states lose weight in terms of political balance. The Electoral College helps to balance this by providing a mechanism for larger states to receive more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account, promoting a more inclusive democracy.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. With its winner-take-all approach, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner without the need for further rounds of voting. This eliminates the complexity and potential complications that may arise from run-off elections and allows for a smooth and efficient presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democracy. It ensures the certainty of outcome, fosters a president for everyone, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the system is not perfect, it offers significant advantages over a direct popular vote. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system as it plays a vital role in our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the information presented in this letter when formulating your stance on this issue.

Sincerely,

"Can you tell the air feels different? Over the past years some countries have put restrictions on car usage. Although this may sound extremely crazy to some, most individuals accept the new law's for car's. Motorized vehicles have put a toll on our environment, our well being, and our wallets. By certain countries banning the use of motorized vehicles it has allowed individuals stress level to decrease, lowered air pollution, and increase money that citizens have. Gas cars that create pollution are a thing of the past, we are moving to electric cars, bicycles, and more the future is changing and its for our own benefits.

Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot. Heidrun Walter claims "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3."" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles. In fact ""70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3."" These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch. In order for you to reduce stress in your life, you have to take away the source of stress, and that is what citizens have done, and without cars majority of people are happier and healthier.

Due to citizen's of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individuals in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer "" after days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Paris bans driving due to smog 10."" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota's ""thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day"" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are ""buses"". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered. The reasons are simple, using less cars makes less gases, also those who go the day without using cars may like the change better and permantely switch to a lifestyle without cars.

Another thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our ""recession"" Americans were ""unemployed"" and ""unable to pay The end of car culture 32."" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car. Now some citizens have made the switch to not using motorized vehicles, which has helped increase the amount of money citizens have, which is always an advantage because you are able to pay for other things that are neccasary to your life.

Although cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it's not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car's that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact our lives and the environment. This can be observed in various examples from around the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars responsible for a large percentage of these emissions. In Europe, cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards reducing the impact of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle. In Vauban, Germany, where cars are generally forbidden, residents have opted for alternative modes of transportation such as walking and cycling. This promotes physical activity and can have a positive impact on people's health. It also creates a safer and more vibrant community, with streets filled with pedestrians and cyclists rather than cars. This is also observed in Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day is held every year, encouraging people to hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation. Not only does this reduce traffic congestion, but it also promotes a sense of community and encourages people to be more active.

Limiting car usage can also lead to more efficient and sustainable urban planning. In recent years, there has been a shift towards making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. This means placing stores within walking distance on main streets, rather than having them spread out in malls along highways. This kind of smart planning reduces the need for cars and encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation. It also helps create more vibrant and walkable communities, where people can easily access amenities without relying on cars.

It is important to note that limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. In Vauban, car ownership is allowed, but parking is limited, with only two places to park in large garages at the edge of the development. This allows residents to still have access to cars when needed, but encourages them to use alternative modes of transportation for their daily needs. This approach strikes a balance between convenience and sustainability.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact our lives and the environment. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote a healthier lifestyle, create more efficient and sustainable urban planning, and foster a sense of community. By adopting this approach, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience improved physical and mental well-being, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increased accessibility and efficiency in transportation.

One of the major benefits of limiting car usage is the improvement in individuals' health and well-being. As the passage from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" states, residents of car-free communities report feeling happier and less stressed. Without the constant need to navigate through traffic and find parking spaces, people have more time for physical activities like walking or biking. This leads to a more active lifestyle and better overall health.

Moreover, limiting car usage can significantly reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. As the passage explains, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can mitigate the negative impacts of emissions on climate change and air quality. Car-free communities, like Vauban in Germany, serve as examples of how this can be achieved. These communities prioritize public transportation and walkability, making it easier for residents to rely on alternative modes of transportation and reduce their carbon footprint.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve accessibility and efficiency in transportation. As seen in the passage about Bogota's car-free day, banning cars for a day can significantly reduce traffic congestion and promote the use of alternative transportation options like buses and bicycles. This can lead to more efficient and reliable public transportation systems, making it easier for people to get around without relying on cars. Moreover, car-free communities often prioritize mixed-use development and place stores within walking distance, reducing the need for lengthy car trips to run errands.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience improved physical and mental well-being, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and increased accessibility and efficiency in transportation. Implementing measures like car-free days, car-free communities, and promoting alternative modes of transportation can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"The Electoral College is a process by which we vote for electors not actually the president themself. When you vote for the electors, they decide who will be the president. We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote because it gives the people a say in who runs our country, an easier way to elect persons into office, and no one state has more of a say.

Many poeple believe that we are voting for the president when we vote for our electors, but in reality, we are voting for them to vote. We, as the people of the United States of America, have always had the right to freedom freedom of speech, religion, ect. so why don't we have the freedom to directly choose our president? In the source, the Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defences of the system are wrong', it states ""...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This means that we do not vote directly, only for someone else to decide our fate. Written in the text fo the first source, 'What Is the Electoral College?', it reads ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" With this method, we are never getting results directly, only becoming the middleman when we should be front and center.

Most think that if we have electors we won't have as much trouble getting a person in office. In the eleventh paragraph, in source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defences of the system are wrong', under what's wrong with the electoral college', its speaks of a ""disaster factor"". The ""disaster factor"" is when we vote for electors and they defy the will of the people as this had almost happened with segregationists, nearly making the popular vote for Kennedy not go to Kennedy. As well as the fact that we could easily of had a tie in the electoral vote. As it says in the second source, the matter would fall into the hands of the House of Representatives ""...the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" This means each state has one vote, meaning the will of the people wouldn't have much say in the election.

People in a state all have the same electors, made by a popular vote, practically taking away the people's voice. If things were to change to popular vote we would all have a say in each election. In the Electoral College way of voting, it is ""...unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakesall system in each state."" Along with the fact that in the Electoral College way, the amount of electors is based on population, making the people of a small state insignificant. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."" If all small states stay this way, they may never be able to have a say in any big decision made by the public.

In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.",0
"Who are voters voting for? Whoever they are voting for, it certainly isn't the president. The Electoral College has the potential to cause a nationwide catastrophe, which is why changing the election to popular vote is the best way. The Electoral College should be abolished because of the ""disaster factor"", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election.

The disaster factor is exactly what it sounds like: a disaster. This ""disaster"" is described as the event where electors defy the people they are representing. For example, this happened in the 2000 presidential vote when Al Gore won the public vote, but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush. This means that the electors voted by the people of their state changed their minds about which president they were voting for. This resulted in the opposing vote turnouts in the 2000 presidential election. As said in Source 2, ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" Although some people may argue that it is very rare for something like this to happen, the fact that there is a chance that it could is overwhelming. Clearly, against even the smallest odds, the Electoral College can cause a catastrophe.

A tie would cause a real predicament in a presidential election. In the case of a tie, the choice is given to the House of Representatives. This means that there is an unequal amount of electoral voters. Source 2 says, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Once again, the Electoral College has faulted a simple tie could throw the whole election off. Why would the vote be passed on to the House if there is already a popular vote? If there is already another vote in place and the votes are counted, why not just put those votes to use? Obviously, if a tie could mess up a national vote, then it's time to change our ways.

Although each state decides its electors, how many people are actually voting for the electors? According to Source 3, about onehalf of the eligible American population voted in 2012's presidential election. If only half of the population is voting for a nationwide presidential election, how many people are going to vote for a small, instate election? It isn't clear enough that although the presidential election is bigger, the electoral election is much more important. However, if we just had a popular vote instead of the Electoral College, everyone would vote in the presidential election because everyone already knows the importance of the presidential election. Yet, people aren't aware enough of the importance of the electoral vote and although the government has tried to stress the importance of voting it, nobody seems to catch on. It is evident that a large percentage of the population does not understand the need to vote in the electoral election. People simply do not understand that this election determines the outcome of the presidential election, which is why it shouldn't even exist.

The Electoral College is regarded as a nondemocratic method of selecting a president. It is true hypocracy and should be replaced because of the ""disaster factor"", prospect of a tie, and the fact that more citizens vote in the presidential election compared to the electoral election. The presidential election isn't a nationwide election it is an election that takes place in a little room where 538 electors decide the political fate for millions of people living in the United States of America.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the event of a disputed election, the system provides a clear path for resolution. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, thereby minimizing the risk of prolonged legal battles and uncertainty. This was particularly evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. 

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. No particular region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across the nation. This ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than just those in certain geographic regions. Without the Electoral College, candidates may be tempted to focus solely on densely populated areas, neglecting the concerns of less populated regions.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. Under this system, candidates are compelled to campaign vigorously in these states, knowing that they hold the key to victory. This leads to greater engagement and attention from voters, creating an electoral process where the most thoughtful and informed voters have the greatest impact. By contrast, a popular vote system would encourage candidates to spend their time and resources in just a handful of heavily populated states, disregarding the concerns of other regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives a fair representation to states with smaller populations. The electoral vote allocation reflects the mal-apportionment of the Senate, providing some balance to the political influence of smaller states. This ensures that these states are not overshadowed by larger states during presidential campaigns, giving them the opportunity to have their concerns and interests heard.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner. This prevents the complexities and uncertainties associated with run-off elections, allowing a smooth transition of power and certainty in the outcome.

While some critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states that are considered safe or stronghold for a particular party, the high voter turnout in recent elections indicates that voters still feel motivated to cast their vote, irrespective of the electoral outcome of their state. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, fair representation for smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These benefits are crucial to maintaining a stable and balanced democracy in the United States. For these reasons, I respectfully urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust you will consider the arguments I have presented and make the best decision in the interest of our great nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage result in a healthier environment for you and your children, exercise by walking or riding a bike, and saving money on parking and gas.

Limiting car usage would be beneficial for the environment because the gas wouldn't polute the air. Green house gas emissions from tailpipe polute the air that everyone is breathing. If the car usage was limited, then the air would start to become fresh again. Stated in the passage, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" This exerpt from the passage ""CarFree Cities"" explains that Europe's percentage is too high and they need to drop it fast or the percentage will grow and the greenhouse gas emissions will increase.

Limiting car usage isn't a big move like most people are making it out to be. Walking to pick up your child from school isn't such a bad thing! It gives you bonding time to spend with them outdoors. You can walk or ride a bike to the park to play. Especially if it is less than 1 mile! Walking is a great way to exercise and its free! FREE! This component of ""smart planning"" could work if eveyone helped by reducing car use.

Having a car is expensive! You have to pay for gas, which is expensive, and you have to pay to park your car! If you live in the area where you want to go, walk! But if you're going to the grocery store, obviously you would take your car if you're getting a lot at the store. You have to pay to park in the parking garage and that is 40,000 with a house. The passage ""CarFree Cities,"" states that ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here."" In that town, everything is pretty close to each other so you don't have to drive anywhere. If you needed to go visit a family member in a different city, the the train! It's fun, free, and calming.

As you can see, you don't need to drive a car. Yes, you can drive a car, but why would you? You have buses, and trains, and other ways of transportation. This way, you don't have to pay for gas to go to the park. Not using your car is healthy for the environment and it's great exercise. It's a good way to get outdoors and have a nice walk. So please, just try using your car a little bit less everyday and soon enough, you will rarely use it, the air will be fresh, and you'll be taking some nice strolls in the park with your family.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage in cities and suburbs can have numerous advantages for both the environment and the quality of life for residents. The passage set provides evidence of the success of car-free communities and events in Germany, France, and Colombia, highlighting the benefits that can be achieved through smart planning and alternative transportation options. By reducing car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote healthier and more active lifestyles, and create more accessible and sustainable communities.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By adopting a car-free or car-reduced lifestyle, individuals can contribute to the effort of drastically reducing these emissions. In Paris, enforcing a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped clear the smog that had reached levels comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world.

Limiting car usage also promotes more active and healthier lifestyles. In car-free communities like Vauban, residents are more inclined to walk, cycle, or use public transportation. The passage mentions that 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This shift in transportation habits can have significant health benefits, reducing the instances of sedentary behavior and promoting physical activity. Furthermore, car-free events, such as the Car-Free Day in Bogota, encourage people to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic congestion and creating a more pleasant and safe environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more accessible and sustainable communities. Smart planning initiatives aim to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, reducing the need for extensive road networks and parking spaces. The passage mentions that stores in these new approaches are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This creates a more pedestrian-friendly environment and encourages local businesses, leading to a sense of community cohesion. The passage also highlights the construction of bicycle paths and the transformation of sidewalks and parks, which improve the infrastructure and make it more enjoyable for people to walk or cycle.

In summary, limiting car usage has several advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting active lifestyles, and creating accessible and sustainable communities, we can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future. The successes seen in car-free communities and events in Germany, France, and Colombia demonstrate the potential impact of such initiatives on improving the quality of life for citizens. It is essential that we continue to explore and implement these alternatives to reduce our dependence on cars and create a more sustainable future.",1
"The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years. It allows for silly tricks to be played you can win the presidency with a mere forty percent of the country in support of you. You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count. The system even allows for massive corruption to go unpunished, which is one of the biggest offenses in our country.

The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country. According to source two, Al Gore ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Al Gore had a significant victory in popular vote for the nation, yet still was denied presidency due to the electoral college's vote assignment system. If we did away with the electoral college, each and every person would have an equal say, and would be equally important to the candidates. Even source three agrees that the trust in our electors is occasionally betrayed, albeit rarely.

Currently, the candidates can completely ignore portions of our country. Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital.

The electoral college system also allows for an astonishing amount of corruption with no punishment. If a state manages to vote one hundred percent Democrat, rogue electors can still cast their vote for the Republican candidate and this isn't against the rules. We're essentially putting the next four years of our country into the hands of 538 electors, and holding them to the lowest possible degree of accountability. Again, source three clearly states ""and that trust is rarely betrayed."" While it's rare, it's still more than possible, and can be quite disastrous.

Some may argue that the electoral college system puts into place a system of certainty and safety, for both the candidates and the people. This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, ""the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised."" While this source claims that ignoring biased parts of the population, this is quite far from the truth. People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only onehalf of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote.

Our country prides itself on being ""the land of the free, and the home of the brave,"" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.",0
"""Abolish the electoral college!"" is a famous statement that was made by Bob Dole on whether or not it would be a good idea to keep the electoral college. Though others may disagree and say that our founding fathers established the Electoral College. Also that it was established with the mindset of helping the American people, but i would like to think otherwise. I believe that the we should change the system by which we vote the president of the United States into election by popular vote. For many years we have been using the concept of the Electoral College and for many years, it has lead to unfair calls and the placing of bad leadership in our country. In the article titled, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author defines what the electoral collage system really is, the author states, "" Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This system is an unfair system, and can not be trusted. It time for change.

The electoral collage is a dishonesty to voters, it is an unfair system. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author makes a good claim. He or she talks about the winner takes all system that is affiliated with the electoral college. In the 13th paragraph the author specifically says, "" Because of the winnertakeall system in each tate, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races ""swing"" state."" That shows how unfair it is to us as the American people. Certain states may not get a chance to see who their choices are. They are forced to make a decision based on the little we know and the majority of the knowledge comes form the media which is a very unreliable source. "" During the2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" That shows how little our voices are heard in a desion that is crucial for how we go about and make decisions in our everyday lives. We the American people have to rely on states such as Ohio for who our president will be.

There is dishonesty every where you go. More so in the electoral college. When the electors are chosen we have no say so. The state legislatures are the ones responsible for picking the electors. In paragraph 11 of ""The indefinsible Electoral College"", the author makes a remark that everyone should put into regards. It says ""That those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Just like people can lie about their age, electors san also fib about their position or party in which they are representing. The author also mentions in paragraph 11, : In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please.""Not everyone can be trusted, and the dishonesty is another reason why we should do away with the electoral college and change to election by popular vote. With the election by popular, we are assured that there is fair play even though some of us may not get our voice heard completely.

People who are for the concept of the electoral college may argue other wise. For instance, in the article called, ""In Defense of the Electoral College"", the author argues that "" The Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons"", meaning its idea of support. I believe the Electoral College is an overrated nor practical.

I am in favor of abolishing the electoral collage amd changing to election of by popular vote. With the system of election of popular vote, you will be sure that the system is fair,honest, and speakes the voices of the American people. As a sentor you should take the best interest of the American people to heart.",0
"Dear Senator, Presidential elections are closer than they seem, and your people have a complaint you need to hear. It involves the right to vote directly for a leader, and the ignoring of the vast majority. People have spoken in favor of omitting the Electoral College and sticking to what the people themselves deem acceptable for a president not what one person decides for millions.

It does not make sense for the voters of America not to vote directly for who they want to lead, represent, and protect their country. Especially if the people cannot even choose who the electors are! That is ignoring the 23rd Amendment all together.

But do not get me wrong, I understand that some people are more comfortable with the Electoral College and they prefer to leave it in the hands of somebody politically intelligent and aware, but that usually means that those people need education and knowledge about the state of their country, and need to be aware of how important their right to vote directly is. The Electoral College can go so wrong so fast and we need to go by what the majority millions say rather than the minorities with little to no knowledge. Us as Americans need to be educated when it comes to who is running in order for us to be able to say yes or no for ourselves not depend on an unknown entity who might not even listen to what the people are saying.

So many great people who were voted most popular and accepted amongst the people have actually lost presidency over the fact that the College had the upper hand. This is unfair to those in America who took the time to directly vote and who took the time to learn and watch debates that the opponent won due to the fact that thousands upon thousands did not speak for themselves and left it to somebody else blindly.

In conclusion, Senator, I am asking you to think: is there ever really a happy turn out from ignoring the vast majority or doesn't that lead to an eventual uprising? Letting one speak for all is an unitelligent thought, we are a country where the people have power, have a voice, and are aware. Losing that is losing what makes us free. We all need the vote, we all need the voice, and we all have the right to choose exactly what we want for the future of this country.

Thank you for your time, and thank you for listening.",0
"Limiting car usage is a tremendous advantage. Haven't you ever thought why? limiting car usage has its reason why its an advantage. One of the huge reasons is pollution, cars tend to create pollution, congestion, smog and many other harmful things. Source 14 mentions useful information of the disadvantage of owning or driving a car. Source number two mentions how cars tends to create lot of pollution, for this reason in Paris they decided to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Nobody would like to live in a place where you have to be breathing dirty, contaminated air and knowing you produced it by your own car when Paris enforced to ban cars for a few days to clear out the global air not many fellow citizens participated about 4,000 citizen were charged with a fine for not following the rule. why would you try to be disobedient when what they are trying to do is help you clear out the global sir so the citizens living in that area dont get sick with any disease and dont harm our earth where we live. The advantage of limiting car usage will be creating less pollution to have a better global air. Cars aren't the only way to get to place to place there is other way to transport for example public transport like buses, train or even if its not that far walking and itll be a create exercise.

Yes, driving a car could sound great because you get to drive anywhere you want and get to places quicker instead of catching or waiting for a public transport when you need to get somewhere and your in a rush. Cars are a huge hand like a big help because it helps people get from place to place. Also remember that cars arent cheap at all an example is that source number one mentions "" Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two placesto parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" What this quote is pointing out is that to be able to park a car if you own one it has to be in a specific place and which you have to own and live by there which costs lot of money. Limiting yourself for car usage would make you save up a whole lot of money. Instead of wasting like 40,000 dollars in a parking place for a car and have to be living there you can easily just get on public transport and be able to live where you want. source 1 also mentions "" As a result 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a to move here. when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this also points out the not many people in Germany dont own cars and not owning a car really doesnt bother them because they found better way to get a transport and also believing that Saving up money is a really important thing because when you become independ you have to start paying bills, food, and many other things that wyour parents wont give you anymore so why waste it on gas and car washing instead of just getting somewhere in a easy transport and the money you wouldve been wasting in nonsense now will be saved up for something more useful. thinking about it car limiting is a useful thing finacialy and global reaosns too.

Lastly another advantage of limiting car usage is less congestion the less driving there is the less traffic there will be. Traffic is a big headche to people who try to get to their jobs or certain events on time. Public transportion might ttake long to get there also but its becauise there isnt as much buses because not many people get on public transportion and the less buses there is and more cars who cause traffic the more time it'll take off our time. Source 3 states "" in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams."" Bogota, colombia has a great point doing this event once a year will demonstrate citizen that the less car usage the less traffic jams there with be and it will be more relaxing and calming area to live instead of hearing screaming, beeping and other annoying sounds caused by unpatient people. This event that colombia has done has cause other states to realize that thats a great idea and some tried experminting it in their country.

In conclusion limiting car usage has its great advantages which benefits the citizens living in that area so if it benefits you why not try limiting car usage. Limiting car usage creates less pollution, less traffic jams, and your able to save up your money for something thats actually important. Cars aren't the only way you could get from place to place theres many other options like walking, or riding a public transport theres always an answer to everything. By limiting car usage we create less pollution in the air we breathe and there wil be less harm done to the earth and to the citizens. Always try new things and let limmiting car usage be one of them.",0
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and society as a whole. One of the main advantages is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. According to a study mentioned in one of the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change on the environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality and reduce smog in cities. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog highlights how congestion decreased by 60 percent after just five days of the ban (Duffer). This demonstrates how a reduction in car usage can lead to cleaner and healthier air for citizens. Furthermore, the passage about Bogota's car-free day shows how the event aims to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation (Selsky). The success of this program in other countries suggests that limiting car usage can be an effective solution for improving air quality in cities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. By making cities more accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, we can encourage a healthier and more active lifestyle for individuals. The passage about Vauban, Germany, where streets are completely ""car-free,"" demonstrates how this can create a more pleasant and peaceful environment for residents (Rosenthal). Furthermore, the passage about Bogota's car-free day shows how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams (Selsky). This not only reduces congestion but also promotes a sense of community and social interaction among citizens.

Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The passage about President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions mentions how a decrease in car ownership and driving can have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment (Rosenthal). This can lead to cost savings in terms of fuel consumption and maintenance. Moreover, the passage suggests that car companies are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, focusing on a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal). This indicates that the automotive industry recognizes the changing cultural shift towards reduced car usage and is adapting accordingly.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can positively impact individuals, communities, and the environment. These advantages include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and economic benefits. By embracing smart planning and adopting strategies to limit car usage, we can create more sustainable and livable cities for future generations.",1
"Today, many people all around the world rely too heavily on their cars. There are many great reasons that car usage should be limited. Car usage should be decreased because owning a car can be stressful, dangerous, and cars give off unwanted gas and pollution. Although cars have been used for many years, it is not too late to take action on this problem.

Many people today would agree that buying and maintaining a car is very stressful. It is very expensive to own a car, and it takes a lot of hard work to keep the car in good shape. ""I am much happier this way,"" states Heidrun Walter Rosenthal, 3. Walter states that she is much happier without a car due to all the stress that comes with owning a car. Walter also states that while she had a car, she was ""always tense,"" Rosenthal, 3. This is probably because of the expenses and time she had to sacrifice while trying to take good care of her vehicle. This includes buying the car, paying for gas and insurance, repairs, and washing it. People will save themselves a lot of time and money if the amount of car usage is limited.

Not only are cars are stressful to maintain, but they are also very dangerous to operate. People run the risk of severe accidents every day when they drive their car. In Source 4, the author states that new forms of public transportation will ""improve safety,"" Rosenthal, 43. The most occurring accidents are car accidents, which happen everyday. Families will have to worry less about losing people they are close to. There will be less unnecessary accidents, such as drunk driving, and using phones while behind the wheel. By reducing the amount of drivers on the road, the risk of these accidents will become much lower.

One last reason that car usage should be limited is that cars give off lots of unwanted gas and pollution into the air. Recently, Paris faced ""nearrecord pollution,"" Duffer, 10. This was caused by the extreme amount of emissions from their cars. The main cause for people wanting to reduce the use of cars is because of this unhealthy gas. Cities all over the world are making efforts to help reduce and prevent the emissions. The only way to do this is limit the usage of cars. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" Rosenthal, 34. If the change can be made, then it should, in order to keep the environment safe. There isn't much time before the pollution gets out of hand.

Although so many people rely on cars so much, they do not see the advantages of not using them. Most people don't put into consideration how harmful these vehicles are to the environment. On top of that, they cause uneeded stress and danger. Because of these reasons, the usage of cars should be limited.",0
"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe. In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban the car free city has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the environment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the environment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rushhour every day. Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.",0
"To Whom It May Concern, The Electoral College that is used when electing the president is a flawed system and should be replaced by and election by the popular voted. The Electoral College does not always show what the people want and it is unfair to voters in certain states.

The Electoral College should be replaced with an election by popular vote because it is not always a fair representation of what the voters want. This means that if most of the popular votes can be for one candidate, but the other candidate wins the majority of the Electoral votes. This is shown in the article In Defense of the Electora College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. In thsi source the author states,""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral voter will not win the popular vote.... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but fewer electoral votes""Posner, Line 16. This shows how what the majority of the people want to happen, will not always happen in this flawed system.

This system is also unfair to voters in certain states. Candidates usually campaign in what are called ""swing states"" that could vote for either candidate, but this means that many states that candidates are confident of winning in or states they are sure of losing in, will not be campaigned at all. This unfairness is shown in the article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This article says,""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad""Plumer, Line 13. This unfairness causes voters in some states to be uninformed about the candidates which could cause them to vote for people they wouldn't if they had seen some campaigning.

The Electoral College is a flawed system that is unfair to voters and does not always reflect what the citizens want.",0
"Should we keep the electoral college? No because when you vote for your candidate in the presidential election you are actually voting for hisher electors. Also because electors can be anyone not holdin up in the public office. Finally because voters cant always control their elected electoral college member will vote for the same candidate. Over 60 percent of todays voters would prefer a more direct way of electing our officials than how we are electing them now.

Did you know that when you vote for the candidate that you want to be elected into office you are not only voting for that candidate you are actually voting for that candidates electors? Under the electoral college system us voters dont vote for the president but we vote for a slate of electors which in turn elect the candidate we voted for. Say that you voted for Obama in last years election you didnt actually vote for Obama you voted for his electors to vote for im in turn of you voting for them. Many people see this to be fine but say that your candidates electors turned and voted for someone else thus leading you down a road of betrayl. This is one important reason for the electoral party to be disbanded.

Electors that represent a candidate in the presidential run can be anyone not holding public office. Who chooses for these electors? Not the voters of course but the state and sometimes the people who you are actually voting for the electors you havent even heard of or seen in any flyers or ads. That state chooses their officials from state conventions,and even sometimes at the state partys committee or the president has his own party of electors for himself which would in a way be cheating by having your own officials vote for you.

What if the electoral party you voted for to vote for a specific candidate and they went off and changed their mind mid election and passed that countries vote for a different xcandidate in the election? You cant always control the electors to stick with them voting for the elector you voted for but without the electoral college that group of voters who voted for a candidate would actually vote for the candidate that they actually want to win. Thus making the electoral college irrelevent because they dont need to form a party and change their vorte mid election.

We should not not keep the electoral college because of all the flawls in it and the deciving image it holds up. Because you do not vote for the candidate you vote for the electorial party member representing that candidate. That the candidate can be anyone chosen by the state and you cant always control that the member of the electoral college that you voted for to vot for a different candidate that the ended up voting for during the election. This is why we dont need the electoral college to help vote for the presidents we should have a more direct way of voting.",0
"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run out of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad pollution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide pollution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutants and it causes lot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there licenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear, as demonstrated by examples from around the world. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, with only two places available for car parking. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars when they moved there. The residents of Vauban have found that giving up their cars has led to a decrease in stress and an overall increase in happiness. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is growing in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Limiting car usage is an essential step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By separating suburban life from the use of cars, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce emissions from tailpipes. This approach is known as ""smart planning"" and involves making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, as well as reducing the space available for parking. By placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of in malls along highways, communities can encourage residents to rely less on cars for their everyday needs.

Efforts to limit car usage are gaining traction in the United States as well. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are beginning to take action. It is expected that public transportation serving suburbs will play a much larger role in federal transportation bills in the coming years. In the past, the majority of funding has gone towards highways, but that is likely to change as the importance of reducing car usage becomes more widely recognized.

Other cities around the world are also implementing car-free initiatives. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog, and the ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia has been hosting a car-free day for the past few years, which has gained popularity and drawn the attention of municipal authorities from other countries. These cities are discovering that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also promotes alternative transportation options, reduces stress, and creates a more connected and vibrant community.

The decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States may indicate a fundamental shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the country. While the decrease in driving can partly be attributed to the recession, researchers believe that there is something more fundamental going on. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the availability of car-pooling apps are all contributing to a cultural shift away from car dependence.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and impactful. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and reducing stress, communities around the world are finding that embracing alternative transportation options and creating car-free spaces can lead to significant benefits. By reimagining suburbs and promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking, we can create more sustainable and vibrant communities for future generations.",1

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for the Presidential Election

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a crucial component of our democratic system. In considering this issue, I have carefully reviewed several sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote system, where a dispute over the result can easily arise, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote. The winner-take-all basis in most states also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral vote victory. Therefore, the Electoral College system minimizes the likelihood of post-election disputes.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is ""everyone's president."" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a scenario where a candidate with only regional support becomes the president and neglects the interests of other regions. By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters, the Electoral College promotes a more inclusive and representative presidency.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in the Electoral College system motivates candidates to campaign in swing states. As seen in the 2012 election, candidates focused their efforts on toss-up states, where the election outcome is uncertain. This increases voter engagement and encourages thoughtful voting, as voters in swing states become crucial in deciding the election. By prioritizing the concerns and interests of states that are not firmly aligned with either party, the Electoral College forces candidates to address a wider range of issues.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. Large states, which suffer from the mal-apportionment of the Senate, regain some weight in the political balance through the allocation of electoral votes. A victory by a slight margin in a large state, such as Florida, yields a significant number of electoral votes, while a similar victory in a small state, like Wyoming, results in fewer electoral votes. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on large population centers and gives smaller states a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the cases of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This prevents the elections from becoming more complex and expensive with the requirement of run-off elections.

While I understand that opponents of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair and outdated, I believe that the advantages it offers outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College promotes stability, ensures a more inclusive presidency, encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College for the presidential election. It is integral to our democratic system and provides a fair and effective means of selecting the President of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope that you will consider my perspective in your decision-making process.

Yours sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to society, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more accessible and interconnected communities. The passage set highlights several examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to limit car usage and have seen positive outcomes.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly reduced, contributing to efforts to combat climate change. The passage also notes that recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, which could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog highlights how congestion was reduced and pollution levels dropped significantly during this period. By limiting the number of cars on the road, cities can improve air quality and create healthier environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage about Vauban, Germany, explains that the community is completely car-free, except for a few main streets with access to public transportation. As a result, residents rely on cycling and walking as their primary modes of transportation. This not only reduces car dependency but also encourages physical activity, leading to a healthier population.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more accessible and interconnected communities. The passage discusses how Vauban has stores placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than distant malls. This concept of smart planning, as described in the passage, makes it easier for residents to access essential services and public transportation without relying on cars. By designing communities with less space for parking and a greater emphasis on public transportation and walkability, cities can create more vibrant and connected neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of advantages to society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and create more accessible and interconnected communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive outcomes that can be achieved when communities and cities prioritize limiting car usage and implement measures to support alternative forms of transportation. By embracing these ideas, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the ModelT, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the environment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many ""celebrate"" no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his twoseat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraints throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summerlife to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around environmentally, but to also meet and be with friends and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more ecofriendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upperclass community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privileges due to the extreme amount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollution gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this twoday restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer environment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The environment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive. So every once in a while don't be afraid to pedal the old Shwinn or hop on the Greyhound, it just might be better than you think.",0
"We cuiiently live in a woild dependent on machines becoming moie and moie enveloped in this idea of ieliance. Howevei, now we have ieached a point wheie that ieliance is haiming us and oui planet, and it will continue to do so if we don't adjust oui lifestyles. Seeing as that we've iecently ieached that point of iealization, we aie staiting to limit ouiselves to the things that do haim oui planet, including limiting the usage of cais. Living in the twentieth centuiy almost inevitably means ielying on cais foi tianspoitation. Although it may seem impossible to convince so many to puisue this act of limiting the usage of cais, it is suiely not impossible, as we've seen fiom the iecent effoits made aiound the woild. It will take time to adjust to the diastic change, but the benefits aie woith the while. A few of the many advantages include, the conseivation of oui valuable space, impioving the quality of oui enviionment, and allowing foi the oppoitunity of new ideas, developments, and change.

The fiist of the advantages may not be the fiist you would think of, yet it is ceitainly an impoitant one. By limiting oui use of cais it would save and ieplenish oui amount of space that we cuiiently have available. It's not only the cais themselves that take up space, but it is also the space left foi stieet paiking in the big cities, the massive paiking gaiages used at shopping malls, and the diiveways and gaiages at the houses in laige subuiban neighboihoods. This method of limiting the use of cais as been successfully applied to a town in Geimany, known as Vauban. In Vauban, "" iresidents of this upscale community aie subuiban pioneeis, going wheie few soccei moms oi commuting executives have evei gone befoie: they have given up theii cais "" "" In Geiman Subuib, Life Goes On Without Cais"" . The town of Vauban, has given up theii aieas of stieet paiking, diiveways, and home gaiages to limitalmost entiielytheii use of cais. With the iemoval of all tiaces of automobile usage, some may be conceined about how they aie expected to ieach theii desiied destinations, but in Vauban and many othei places piepaiing the follow this plan, stoies will be placed "" a walk away, on a main stieet, iathei than in malls along some distant highway "" "" In Geiman Subuib, Life Goes On Without Cais"" . Although some may be conceined with the potential limit on theii cai usage, they must be ieminded that the space oiiginally used foi cais will ceitainly not go to waste, and will be used foi biggei and bettei puiposes that will not haim oui planet.

This second advantage is the one most associated with the limit put on oui use of caisthe impioved quality of the enviionment. The enviionment can be impioved with the deciease of gieenhouse gas emissions, which in tuin impioves the quality of the aii that suiiounds us. Oui Piesident, Baiack Obama, has "" ambitious goals to cuib the United States' gieenhouse gas emissions "" "" The End of Cai Cultuie "" , but that can only be done with the coopeiation of the citizens. Foitunately, that coopeiation has been seen with the "" foituitous assist fiom an incipient shift in Ameiican behavioi "", in which "" iecent studies suggest that Ameiicans aie buying fewei cais, diiving less and getting fewei licenses as each yeai goes by "" "" The End of Cai Cultuie "" . It is undeistood by piofessionals, that if the pattein continues, "" it will have beneficial implications foi caibon emissions and the enviionment, since tianspoitation is the second laigest souice of Ameiica's emissions "" "" The End of Cai Cultuie "" . Although some may be ieluctant to puisue the path of limiting theii use of cais, they should be well infoimed that by doing so, they aie impiovong theii oveiall state of living by not pioducing these haimful piopeities that aie being ieleased into the aii that we bieathe.

This last advantage is most likely the most consideiably accepted by the public, because of its simplicity on theii pait and the benefits they iecieve fiom it. With the limit put on the use of cais, that allows foi the oppoitunity of new ideas, developments, and change. The idea of limiting the use of cais has gone global, fiom Geimany to Colombia to Fiance, this idea is quickly becoming one widely accepted by the public and theii officials. The idea of a caifiee dat has spiouted fiom Colombia, in which the citizens of Colombia aie encouiaged tohike, bike, skate, oi take the bus to woik iathei than using cais foi tianspoitation "" Caifiee day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" . The public has iesponded positively to these iecent changes, saying, "" ' It's a good oppoitunity to take away stiess and lowei aii pollution ' "", which was spoken by "" Cailos Aituio Plaza as he iode a twoseat bicycle with his wife "" "" Caifiee day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" . Not only have new oppoitunities foi the public been intioduced, but so have new developments. The new developmets include "" paiks and spoits centeis...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been ieplaced by bioad, smooth sidewalks...and new iestauiants and upscale shopping distiicts "" "" Caifiee day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "" . The citizens of vaiious cities can also expect to see plans in which "" ' pedestiian, bicycle, piivate cais, commeicial and public tianspoitation tiaffic aie woven into a connected netwoil to save time, conseive iesouices, lowei emissions, and impiove safety ' "" "" The End of Cai Cultuie "" .

Theie have been many advantages associated with a limit put on the use of cais, including the conseivation of oui valuable space, the loweiing of the gieenhouse gas emissions, and the oppoitunity foi new ideas, developments, and change. All of these advantages can be fulfilled to theii entiie puiposes, but it is a gioup effoit as a planet. We can continue to live in the luxuiy of these advantages, as long as we do oui pait to limit oui use of cais.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This idea is supported by various examples presented in the passage set. The German suburb of Vauban, for instance, has successfully implemented a car-free policy, resulting in 70% of families not owning cars. This has led to a happier community, with residents feeling less stressed and enjoying the tranquility of car-free streets. Furthermore, Vauban's experiment aligns with a global trend of separating suburban life from auto use, highlighting the increasing importance of smart planning and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars.

In addition to the positive impacts on individuals' well-being, limiting car usage can also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a substantial percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By adopting policies that promote alternative transportation and reduce the dependence on cars, suburban areas can contribute to the global efforts to combat climate change. For example, Paris enforced a partial driving ban in response to high levels of pollution, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have an immediate and positive impact on the environment.

The success of car-free initiatives is not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia has implemented an annual car-free day with the aim of promoting alternative transportation and reducing pollution. This event has garnered significant participation, with millions of Colombians opting for biking, walking, or taking public transportation instead of driving. The positive response to this initiative highlights the willingness of individuals to embrace alternatives to car usage when given the opportunity.

The decreasing trend in car ownership and driving in the United States also provides evidence for the advantages of limiting car usage. Recent studies suggest a decline in both car sales and miles driven per person. This shift in behavior can have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment as transportation is a major contributor to emissions. Moreover, this change in behavior can be attributed to various factors, including advancements in technology that facilitate telecommuting and flexible commuting arrangements.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various examples found in the passage set. From improved well-being and reduced stress to lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality, there are numerous benefits to be gained from embracing alternatives to car usage. As cities and suburbs around the world adopt policies that promote smart planning and reduce dependence on cars, we can create more sustainable and environmentally friendly communities.",1
"Dear Senator, I am not alone when I say that I'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. According to the gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters prefer a direct election, but Congress does nothing to change that. Keeping the Electoral college is unfair to the people of the United States. We should not keep the electoral College because, when Americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people and the process of a tie in the Electoral College is too unfair to the people.

When Americans are voting for a new president, they want their opinion to count. The popular vote explains what the people wanted for president, but that's not what the people are voting for. When we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors they in turn vote for the president. Voters can't control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president.

In the 2000 presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, but Bush won the election due the amont of electoral votes over powering the popular votes. This completely goes against what the people want. The state legislatures are responsible for picking our slate electors these electors have the right to defy the will of the people. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please.

During a presidential election, one of the most worrying things to receive from an electoral vote is a tie. When there is a tie, the election is sent to the House of Representatives. Due to the fact that many voters vote one party for the president and another for Congress, the House's selection will barely reflect the will of the people. Their votes can be the complete opposites of the people's vote. You could help us bring an end to the Electoral College.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my thoughts on the topic of the Electoral College and its significance in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from multiple sources, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College for several reasons.

One of the primary reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article, the winner-take-all system in most states ensures that the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes is almost always the winner of the presidency. This reduces the chances of disputes over the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 election. Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes stability by requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal and prevents a candidate with only regional support from winning the presidency, ensuring that the president represents the interests of the entire nation.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, this forces candidates to pay attention to a diverse range of voters and regions, preventing a candidate from solely targeting specific demographic groups or areas. This ensures that candidates engage with a wide variety of voters and address their concerns, resulting in a more comprehensive representation of the electorate's interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states. As Posner mentions, the apportionment of electoral votes gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates, as their higher population translates to a greater number of electors. This system compensates for the malapportionment of the Senate and allows smaller states to have a proportional say in the election of the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This prevents complex and time-consuming run-off elections, maintaining the efficiency and integrity of the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters and that it diminishes the importance of individual votes, it is important to note that the goal of the Electoral College is to ensure the election of a president who represents the interests of the entire nation. As Judge Posner mentions, the majority of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections, indicating that voters are motivated by their desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that a single vote may sway the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven its worth by providing certainty of outcome, promoting trans-regional appeal, encouraging candidates to engage a wide range of voters, balancing the influence of large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. While the system is not perfect and has occasional flaws, the benefits it brings to our democracy outweigh the arguments for a popular vote. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully review the information provided and make the decision that best represents the interests of the constituents you serve.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The United States has ways of being civilized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. The U.S should stick with the Electoral College because its a game changer and trust worthy.

To start off the Electoral College is a game changer for Election Day. In the article "" In defense of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney"". In this piece of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. Now in the article ""the indefensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. But even thought bradford disagrees with the method, bradford still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. Basically the Electoral College is just a big game changer on Election Day.

Futhermore the Electoral College is just a trust worthy method to use. Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. So the electoral college just gives people want they want from trust.

All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent as cities and communities around the world experiment with car-free living. One example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where cars are prohibited from parking on the streets and in driveways and home garages. The only places to park are large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Residents report feeling happier and less stressed without the constant use of cars (Rosenthal). This trend is seen in other parts of the world as well, with efforts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislators are starting to take action (Rosenthal).

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, cities and communities can contribute to the effort of reducing these emissions (Rosenthal).

Another advantage is the improvement in air quality. Cities like Paris have implemented partial driving bans during periods of severe smog. During these bans, congestion decreased by 60 percent and the air quality improved significantly. The main culprit for the smog was diesel fuel, which is favored in France due to tax policies. Limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution and improve the health of residents (Duffer).

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and walkable communities. In Vauban, stores are located within walking distance on a main street instead of being scattered in distant malls. This ensures that residents have easy access to daily necessities without having to rely on cars. By creating more walkable communities, people can become more active, leading to better health outcomes (Rosenthal).

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In cities like Bogota, Colombia, car-free days are being implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite challenges like rain, millions of Colombians have participated in these car-free days. This event has attracted attention from other countries and is seen as a revolutionary change. Moreover, this shift in behavior has led to the construction of more bicycle paths, improved infrastructure, and the growth of restaurants and shopping districts. These changes can create economic opportunities and enhance the livability of cities (Selsky).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant and varied. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating walkable communities and boosting the economy, limiting car usage can lead to numerous benefits for individuals and society. As cities and communities around the world embrace car-free living, it is clear that this trend is a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent in many parts of the world. One example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where car ownership is discouraged. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents actually sold their cars to move there. According to one resident, life without a car has reduced stress and made them happier. This suburban experiment demonstrates the potential benefits of separating suburban life from auto use.

The trend of separating suburbs from car usage is not limited to Germany. It is also being adopted in other parts of Europe, the United States, and the developing world. Planners are aiming to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are being placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. Transportation for America, a coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States, is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. This shift in planning is necessary, as passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions.

The advantages of limiting car usage are not only environmental, but also social and economic. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. Congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Delivery companies did suffer some financial losses due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for specific types of vehicles, such as plug-in cars and hybrids. Public transit was also made free of charge during this period. This example shows that limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality and reduce congestion in cities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the quality of life in cities. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The program has spread to other countries, and there has been a significant decrease in traffic congestion during the car-free day. The event has also led to the construction of more bicycle paths and parks, improved sidewalks, and the development of new restaurants and shopping districts. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable cities with better infrastructure and amenities.

There are several factors contributing to the decrease in car usage. One major factor is the shift in behavior among Americans. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has been steadily decreasing since then. This decrease in driving has environmental benefits, as transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also leading to changes in the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range. This shift in behavior is attributed to various factors, including the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, the availability of car-pooling apps, and the proliferation of car-sharing programs.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease congestion, and create more livable cities. The shift towards limiting car usage is not limited to one country but is a global trend. It is important for policymakers, urban planners, and individuals to recognize the benefits of reducing car usage and work towards creating more sustainable and accessible communities.",1
"Dear Florida Senator, There is a major problem in how we elect presidents. The electoral College has to be replaced with a direct election because of how misrepresented many voters are, and how a candidate could lose the majority vote and yet still win the election.

The first problem of the Electoral College is that everyone is not represented. According to Bradford Plumer in paragraph 10, ""... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" and because the voters cannot directly control who they vote for, the electors could choosing a different person than who they said they would, which means that the voters are misrepresented. Another way that voters can become misrepresented is because of confusion. Since voters sometimes get confused about who the electors are voting for, they could end up voting for the wrong person. Also, the Office of the Federal Register states in paragraph 7 ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation"". Due to the ""winnertakeall"" system, many people are not represented in the electoral votes, especially in large, one sidedstates. As a result of this, many of the minorities do not even vote because they know that their vote will not win the state.

Another reason that the electoral College should be replaced with a direct vote is because of how the majority does not get the candidate they chose. In paragraph 16, Richard A. Posner states that ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the firs time since 1888."" and because of the fact that the electoral votes are the deciding factor in choosing a president and not the majority, most of America did not get who they wanted to see as their leader and president. Even though this hardly ever occurs, it still hasto be fixed. As a result, Bradford Plumer states in paragraph 9, that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" which would be a true democracy, unlike the Eectoral College. The Electoral College also has an even number of people in it, which means there could be a tie. However, the Electoral College ""requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" according to Richard A. Posner in paragraph 19. This is not a good thing because when a certain state or region is struggling, a transregional president will not focus their attention on that area of weakness. In a direct democracy, the voters could vote for a president that has an area of expertise in that region or state and could give them a much needed boost, leading to less weaknesses and an allaround better country.

To summarize this completely, the Electoral College has to go. It is unfair, misrepresentful, and is not even a democracy. Eventualy, it has to change.",0
"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking concepts to the suburbs. Residents of an upscale community in Germany have given up their cars, generating a revolutionary change.

Limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, a resident of Bogota, Columbia. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, but thanks to the partial driving ban, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. By reducing the amount of driving we do, we could decrease the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into our atmosphere, ultimately creating a greener, healthier environment for all of earths inhabitants.

An improvement in society is also being made due to the ambitious goals to decrease car usage. Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout cities uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The worlds love affair with vehicles seem to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly nine percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures, the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. If the pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.

""All of our development since World War Two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. By decreasing the amount of car usage, we could generate enough change to truly change the world.",0

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. While I acknowledge the criticisms against the Electoral College, I believe it remains an essential component of our democracy for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated in the passage by Judge Richard A. Posner, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are less likely than disputes over the popular vote outcome. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory. The Electoral College reduces the potential for prolonged election disputes that could undermine the stability and credibility of our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who represents all regions of the country, not just the populous ones. This system requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal and discourages them from focusing solely on winning heavily in certain states. As Judge Posner explains, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By balancing the influence of different regions, the Electoral College ensures that the president becomes a leader for all Americans, not just a select few.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which promotes greater voter attention and involvement. In the passage by Judge Posner, he highlights that voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions. By allocating more electoral votes to these states, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to engage with a diverse range of voters and address their concerns. This fosters a more inclusive and representative democratic process.

Fourthly, the Electoral College gives due weight to large states and mitigates the disproportionate influence of smaller states. As stated in the passage, a large state receives more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns due to the distribution of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of heavily populated regions and neglect the interests of less populated areas. The Electoral College strikes a balance between the voices of urban and rural communities, preventing the exclusion of any segment of the population.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections. When no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes in a direct election, the potential need for run-off elections arises. This could prolong the election process and create logistical challenges. The Electoral College method ensures that a clear winner emerges in every election, providing stability and efficiency to the electoral process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in states they know they have no chance of winning, it is important to note that voters do not necessarily expect their vote to sway a national election. The majority of voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preference and exercise their democratic right, regardless of the expected outcome. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves as a vital cornerstone of our democratic process. It maintains a certainty of outcome, encourages regional representation, fosters voter engagement, gives voice to both large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While it is not a perfect system, it strikes a balance that ensures the president represents the diverse interests of all Americans. Therefore, I implore you to support the Electoral College and resist any attempts to change it to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your continued dedication to upholding the principles of our democratic system and representing the interests of your constituents.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting car usage can put a new perspective in your life. Limiting car usage can be a huge benefit because first of all, you'll have better healthe. This even goes out to thee healtheiest people in theis world. Secondly, Global Warming will be less harsh and dangerous to all thee living creatures of thee world. Lastly, you can be more open and associate withe many people. Limiting car usage is probably thee best idea to reduce all thee hazards and bad theings on Earthe.

To begin withe, I want to inform you theat car usage has become worse and worse over thee years. Our healthe is in jeopardy because of how much we use cars. But withe limiting car usage around thee globe anyone can become a healtheier person. A great percent of our population in the United States are overweight or obese. Even all over thee globe! Withe limiting how much time we use cars we can reduce theat percent and become healtheier people because theat way we can walk to our places and not just sit down in a car doing absolutely notheing. People have become much happier in limiting theeir car usage. Those people go out and get fresh air and not sit in a car going from place to place. And withe being much happier has come less stress. People who are too stressed are not to happy theat's why its better not using a car just to go grocery shopping. You wouldn't have to worry about thee lights and stop signs or be scared if your going to be in a car accident. The only time you should be able to use a car is going long distances and places like otheer cities.

To move foward, Global Warming has become a really big issue for us. All thee pollution theat Planet Earthe gets from cars is absurd! Cars release so much gas and harmful substances theat we breathee in. It doesnt only affect us but animal too and all living theings. Now thee smog has gotten way worse. Paris has a huge percent of smog covering thee city theat even France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear thee air of thee city. Congestion has gone down to 60 percent. Beijing, China is known as one of thee most polluted city in thee world. Now everywhere you go even if its really cold nights arent as cold as theey used to be. Cold nights and warm days have caused thee warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Anotheer theing about limiting car usage is theat you can even associate withe otheer people around you. Just walking to you local market or a food restaurant you are probably say hello to different people some even communicating withe theem. You can walk to parks or go walk to a nearest pool or beach and I guarantee you theat you're going to be talking to many different people theroughtout thee day. You can use alternative transportation such as bus, bikes, scooters and let me tell you being in bikes and scooters is a lot more fun a relaxing theen driving a car or being in one. Walking and hiking around is a huge relieve of stress.

Hence, limiting car usage is a big improvement for us it will help us in so many ways. Such as, we can improve our healthe and we could be so much better because a great percent of theis world is eitheer overweight or obese and limiting cars can help you go out and walk or even bikes can get you where you want to go and theats a form of exercise. Global Warming has been on thee rise. It's been rising and rising and limiting how much we use cars can absolutely help withe it by lowering thee pollution thee temperatures may not be so hot you wont feel like your boiling just walking outside your front door. You can associate withe many different people theroughout your day even if it's just a simple hello. Walking to grocery stores and restaurants can make you feel a whole lot better and relieve your stress and also communicate withe otheer people.",0
"Global warming is one of the main reason, maybe the only reason the is destroying the atmosphere. Humans today are trying to prevent global warming because if we continue to pollute the atmosphere it can very well kill most of the living things, maybe all of the living thing on this planet, including humans ourself. I think reducing the usage of cars today is a great way to stop global warming.

One of the countries that are taking action in doing this is the countries is France. Paris has decided to partially ban driving to clear the air of the global city. In the text it states that, ""on Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31."" This show that paris is trying to get rid of the smog in the air, and now they are asking their citizens to stop driving their cars, bike etc. Also if you don't participate in you will have to pay a fine of 22euro. In addition one of the main substances to motor pollution is diesel fuel. the passage says that, ""diesel was the blame, since the France has...a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" Since France favors the usage of diesel, this one of the main reason why they have forbidden the use of motor in paris. Moreover it states that""diesel make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of the Western Europe."" This again also proves that diesel plays a major role in the pollution of France. As you can see France is making changings to there country due to the global warming.

France is not the only one that has taken action by reducing the car usage. The city BOGOTA, Colombia has also changed their ways in cutting down on car usage.""Millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" the text states. What this is trying to explain is that Columbia has a program that prevents the citizens from using vehicles, so the whole day they usa bikes, skates, and take the bus, even some of them go hiking to wherever they go. Consequently there are some benefits to having a car, such as basic transportation needs. In the text it states that,""but America's love affair with is vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily.""Although driving is something essential to human needs these days, it is also very killing. As you can see other countries have taken part in this struggle to prevent global warming to get any worst.

In conclusion the reduction of using vehicle today can be one big step in slowing down the rate of global warming, although taking away cars me be a major problem to in basic transportation needs, it is better than killing everything on the planet.",0
"Everyone assumes that the best way of transportation is by a car. Teenagers dream of getting their license on their sixteenth birthday and maybe even getting a car. Most adults use cars to get to and from work, drive their kids around and do fun activities. But what people don't understand is that there are so many other alternatives that ultimately result in a happier and healthier planet. There are so many downfall with driving and owning a car that many are now believing that it is much more reasonable to just not own a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal, line 6. Having cars stress people out and people don't even realize this. There are so many responsibilities that come with driving. No one enjoys sitting in long traffic jams. It is annoying and quite bothersome. Everyone gets so frustrated, nevermind the amounts of accidents that lead to injury and death from it all.

In Colombia there is a day once a year in which cars can not go on the road or they are served with a fine. This effort is to try to bring stress levels down and stop air pollution. ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily and devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky, line 23. This idea promoted excessive and got people out and doing things in the community. The citizens clearly were not against this day or else they wouldn't have been active. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city"" Selsky, line 28. This just goes to show what driving does. It isolates people. Without all the cars, one is more willing to spend time outside and interacting with other people and since people were out and about more and enjoying the community, the area has gotten more presentable and pleasurable to be in. ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Selsky, line 29. Officals and shop owners are making more of an effort because everyone is more active and caring.

In Paris, the officals made an effort to try and clean up the cities pollution rates. They assigned a day where even number licensed plates could not be on the road and a day for odd numbered plate cannot be on the road or else they will be fined. ""Congestion was down 60 percent"" Duffer, 14. If anything, it goes to show that the amount of cars on the road is absurb. 60 percent is more than half, that's a lot of traffic. Paris primarily uses diesel, causeing a lot more pollution in this busy city. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"" Duffer, line 17. Paris is a very touristy area and people go in hopes to see a beautiful city. This project went so well that officals planned to continue it. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Duffer, line 19. If officals planned to continue this idea, than it must be benifical in some way. If citizens just made an effort to not drive everywhere, than restrictions would not have to be mad. It's because of the amount of driving that is going on that officals have to get involved.

""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" Rosenthal, line 37 Motor vehicals cause so much danger to Earth. The amount of pollution is so high and dengerous. It is much easier to prevent than everyone believes. One could simply take the bus, ride a bike, only drive to work and needed places, walk, and even car pool. There are an abundant amount of ways to prevent so much pollution and stress. It's all over the world that this is an issue Paris, Colombia, the United States, and many other places. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. "" Rosenthal, line 11. That is a lot. It isn't difficult to help prevent this.

In the long run, not driving would result in happier people anyways. Cars are so expensive that is would cause less aggravation and economic stress as well as the basic stress of just driving and being in traffic. Society could make the world so much cleaner and safer for the next generations. It starts now. Get a bike or a pair of walking shoes and start getting active in the community. Start making the changes now so it isn't forced by officals later. make the effort and show the next generations how life should be. This could lead to a much happier and healthier life style.",0
"It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keeps things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or elect a horrible president, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes put in to elect a president.

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states ""other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president""Posner,19. The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearances but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try to evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. This is due to several reasons, such as the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable communities. By implementing measures to reduce car ownership and promote alternative forms of transportation, cities and suburbs can experience numerous benefits.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and more on public transportation, walking, or cycling, cities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the achievement of environmental sustainability.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the passage set, it is mentioned that high levels of smog and pollution were observed in cities like Paris and Beijing, primarily due to car emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in densely populated areas, cities can improve air quality and prevent respiratory issues. This is particularly important for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more livable and sustainable communities. In the passage set, examples such as Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia are highlighted for their successful implementation of car-free or car-reduced initiatives. These communities have prioritized public transportation, walking, and cycling, making it easier for residents to access essential services and amenities without relying on cars. By creating walkable neighborhoods with easy access to public transportation, cities can promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and improve overall quality of life for residents.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage set mentions that car ownership can be expensive, with high costs associated with purchasing, maintaining, and fueling cars. By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative transportation options, individuals can save money on car-related expenses. Additionally, cities can invest in public transportation infrastructure, creating job opportunities and stimulating economic growth.

In conclusion, there are several advantages of limiting car usage. By reducing the reliance on cars and promoting alternative forms of transportation, cities can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more sustainable communities, and provide economic benefits. It is important for cities and individuals to recognize the potential benefits of limiting car usage and take steps towards implementing measures to achieve these advantages.",1
"Dear State Senator, In voting for a new president we should keep the process of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is apart of the United states history. It was established by our founding fathers in the Constitution. If we keep the Electoral College there will be a less chance of a tie and a dispute then there would be in a popular vote process. Also the Electoral College is fair and we would be avoiding runoff elections.

The first reason we should keep the Electoral College is there will be a certainty of outcome. Even though the total number of votes is 538, the chance of a tie is likely ,but highly unlikely. ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney....Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state,"" this means that a tie is not likely, but it could happen Posner 18. If we used the process of popular vote in the United States there would be a bigger chance of a dispute over the outcome then there would the outcome of an Electoral College.

The next reason we should keep our historical process of the Electoral College is it's fair. According to an excerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" from Slate Magazine , ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" Posner 19. This means that all states are equal and none of them have more or less power than one another and none of the states have enough power to elect a president. Bradford Plumer from Mother Jones thinks ""It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" there are many arguments that state that the electoral college is upright, many people disagree saying its a great system involving easy and fair processes.

Also the Electoral College reduces the pressure which complicates the presidential election process. With the Electoral College the problem of elections where none of the candidates have the majority of the votes cast is avoided. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College"" Posner 22.

Keeping the Electoral College is very important. First off it is a part of our nation's history. It also keeps electing a president easy, fair, and nonpressuring. Even though the method of the Electoral College is outdated and old, it still is a good way of electing a new president. This process keeps disputes from occuring and makes all the states be heard and equal.",0
"Dear Florida Senator, I can't help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College promotes equality for the candidates and the people.

By using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as ""checksandbalances."" In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"": ""The founding fathers established The Electoral College as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,"" Office of the Federal Register 1. This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that ""most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,"" Office of the Federal Register 7. This means that the popular vote does determine for most states anyway whether or not the candidate receives all of the electoral votes for that particular state.

Not only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer whines about how, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,"" going on to say that, ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,"" Plumer 13. However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president...If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president,"" Posner 19. Moreover, Posner also writes that ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election,"" Posner 20.

Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called ""outdated."" But as the saying goes, ""If it 'aint broke, don't fix it.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. As exemplified by the German suburb of Vauban, a car-free community, giving up cars can lead to happier, more relaxed lives. The constant stress and tension associated with car ownership are eliminated, allowing residents to enjoy the tranquility of verdant streets and the sounds of bicycles and children playing. In addition to personal benefits, limiting car usage also has significant environmental advantages. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. By separating suburban life from auto use and promoting smart planning, suburbs can become more compact and accessible to public transportation, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to reduce car usage are not limited to Germany; they are happening around the world. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog, leading to a significant decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia, also implemented a car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce air pollution. These examples show that limiting car usage has been successful in various locations and can be replicated elsewhere. Moreover, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses, indicating a cultural shift away from car dependence. This trend has positive implications for the environment, as transportation is a significant source of emissions. Although the decrease in car usage may have negative impacts on the car industry, companies like Ford and Mercedes are already adapting by rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader range of products. Furthermore, demographic shifts suggest that the trend of reducing car usage will continue, with younger generations showing less interest in car ownership. Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage include personal well-being, environmental sustainability, and the potential for transformative cultural shifts.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. These advantages are highlighted in the passage set, which explores the experiences of different cities and communities that have implemented car-free policies. The benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, decreased traffic congestion, and a shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and work towards meeting environmental goals. For example, the passage mentions the case of Vauban, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to live in the car-free community. This shift away from car usage has contributed to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog highlights the negative effects of car emissions on air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly decrease air pollution levels. This has been demonstrated by initiatives such as the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. The resulting decrease in traffic congestion and car emissions led to a day with significantly cleaner air.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passage set mentions the case of Vauban, Germany, where streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. This car-free design has improved traffic flow and created a more pedestrian-friendly environment. Similarly, the passage about the car-free day in Bogota highlights how banning cars for a day can lead to streets without traffic jams. By limiting car usage, cities can alleviate traffic congestion and create a more efficient transportation system.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes a shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. By discouraging car ownership and providing alternative transportation options, communities can encourage residents to adopt healthier and more environmentally friendly ways of getting around. This is exemplified by the case of Vauban, Germany, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. Similarly, the passage about the car-free day in Bogota mentions the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths and the promotion of buses as alternatives to cars. These initiatives not only reduce car usage but also promote a more active and sustainable lifestyle.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, decreasing traffic congestion, and promoting sustainable modes of transportation, communities can work towards creating a more environmentally friendly and livable future. The passage set provides examples of cities and communities that have implemented car-free policies and reaped the benefits. It is clear that limiting car usage is a step in the right direction towards creating a more sustainable and enjoyable way of life.",1
"Limiting car usage has many advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can make significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more sustainable communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this percentage can be as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a greener and more sustainable future.

Another advantage is the improvement in air quality. Cars emit pollutants that are harmful to human health, such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the level of these harmful pollutants in the air, leading to cleaner and healthier communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable communities. Instead of relying on cars for transportation, we can promote alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. This can result in more compact and accessible communities, with less space dedicated to parking lots and highways. By placing stores and amenities within walking distance, we can create vibrant and livable neighborhoods that encourage community interaction and reduce the need for long-distance travel.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The high cost of car ownership, including fuel, insurance, and maintenance, can be a burden for many individuals and families. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce the financial strain of car ownership and provide more affordable options for transportation. This can free up resources for other essential needs and improve the overall well-being of individuals and communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating more sustainable communities, and providing economic benefits, we can work towards a greener, healthier, and more livable future. It is important for individuals, communities, and governments to recognize these advantages and actively promote and support initiatives that encourage the limitation of car usage.",1
"Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, one that centers on sustainability, public health, and community well-being.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Explanatory Essay

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable forms of transportation. This movement recognizes that the dependence on cars in suburban areas is a major obstacle to achieving these goals. By adopting smart planning principles and creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, we can enjoy several advantages, including reduced emissions, improved quality of life, and a stronger sense of community.

One of the most compelling reasons to limit car usage is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article in the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. For example, in the car-free community of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This reduction in car ownership has led to a noticeable decrease in emissions and a cleaner environment for the community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is an improved quality of life for residents. Rosenthal describes how the residents of Vauban, Germany, have more peaceful and less stressful lives since giving up their cars. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, explains that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now she is much happier. Without the noise and pollution of cars, the streets in Vauban are filled with the swish of bicycles and the laughter of children. This car-free environment provides a more tranquil and enjoyable living experience for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can strengthen the sense of community in suburban areas. In the past, suburbs have been built around car ownership, with houses spread out and connected by extensive road networks. This type of development isolates residents and makes it difficult to interact with neighbors. However, by adopting the principles of smart planning and creating car-free communities, we can encourage more interaction and socialization among residents. In the new approach, stores are placed within walking distance, and public transportation becomes more accessible. This creates a sense of connectivity and encourages people to interact with their neighbors. As David Goldberg of Transportation for America states, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers several advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving quality of life, and fostering a sense of community, we can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment. It is crucial that we continue to explore and implement smart planning principles in order to promote car-free communities and reduce our dependence on cars. As the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota show, this movement is already gaining traction and has the potential to make a significant impact on our society.",1
"  Navigating the Road to Sustainable Urban Living  In a world characterized by relentless urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making room for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. As seen in the passage set, various cities and communities have implemented measures to reduce car dependency, resulting in positive outcomes such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable and efficient transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the passage, passenger cars account for a substantial portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, either through car-free zones or car-free days, emissions can be greatly decreased, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment. For example, the article about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how implementing a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transit. By creating car-free zones or designing communities with accessibility to public transportation, individuals are encouraged to use these more sustainable options. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides health benefits, as active modes of transportation like walking and biking promote physical activity. In the article about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, it is mentioned how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams and promoting alternative transportation.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can contribute to the development of more compact and walkable communities. Instead of relying on vast amounts of land for parking spaces and sprawling suburbs, smart planning can create neighborhoods with amenities within walking distance. This approach, as demonstrated in the German suburb of Vauban, leads to a higher quality of life, reduced dependence on cars, and a stronger sense of community. The article describes how Vauban’s streets are completely car-free, with car ownership limited to a few designated parking areas. As a result, a significant percentage of residents do not own cars and have reported feeling happier and less stressed.

In addition to the environmental and social benefits, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. The passage on the end of car culture highlights that recent studies suggest Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior can lead to lower carbon emissions and reduce the need for extensive highway infrastructure, saving costs in the long run. Moreover, it opens up opportunities for business innovation, such as car-sharing programs and alternative modes of transportation like bike-sharing. These new business models can create jobs and drive economic growth while providing people with affordable and convenient transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, society, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative transportation methods, creating walkable communities, and stimulating economic growth, the limitations on car usage can lead to a healthier, more sustainable, and more enjoyable way of life. As demonstrated in the passage set, various cities and communities around the world are already implementing these measures and experiencing the benefits firsthand. It is crucial for fellow citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that encourage the reduction of car dependency for the betterment of our future.",1
"There is a lot controversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the campaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have already experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic. We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy.

The electoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and incentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the electors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process.

In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saughtafter swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more.

Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights.

For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid RunOff Elections which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner. However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.

The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, which can have several positive effects on physical and mental health.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to global warming, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact in combatting climate change and reducing our carbon footprint.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. Cars contribute to air pollution through their emissions of pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. These pollutants can have harmful effects on human health, leading to respiratory problems, cardiovascular issues, and other illnesses. By reducing car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air, leading to cleaner and healthier environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Walking, biking, and public transit are all more sustainable and eco-friendly options compared to driving. Encouraging people to use these alternative modes of transportation can have numerous benefits. Walking and biking are excellent forms of exercise and can help improve physical fitness. Public transit can also help reduce traffic congestion, making commutes faster and more efficient.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. Traditional suburbs that rely heavily on car usage are often spread out, making it difficult to access essential services like grocery stores, schools, and healthcare facilities without a car. By adopting a model similar to the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, where amenities are within walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible, we can create more sustainable and efficient communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has various advantages for individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, promotes alternative modes of transportation, and creates more compact and accessible communities. By embracing these advantages and adopting smart planning measures, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1
"In many ways, driving is a great resource. But with this great resource, comes flaws. When cars burn gas made of fossil fuels, it causes many environmental disadvantages. Limiting the usage of cars could be good for the people who live on this planet everyone in many ways.

To start, one reason why limiting the usage of cars would be an advantage for our society is the reduction of smog. Smog is caused by the smoke and fog of car exhaust and it is very harming to the environment as well as to humans. In Paris, in 2014, driving was banned because of smog. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro 31 dollar fine. The same would apply to oddnumbered plated the following day."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This quote from the source shows that because Paris is such a huge and global city, the amount of cars needed to have the city function in the way society has been making it function for the past years has created serious pollution. This crazy amount of pollution created smog in Paris. In fact, according to the article, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog This type of pollution is know for causing certain kinds of cancer in people, and is what is thought to be the reason for the Ozone hole above antarctica. Not to mention it makes the day gloomy and not as bright because of the trapped smoke and pollution. In Vauban, Germany, the ""streets are completely carfree'"" Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars A resident from this suburb said ""'When I had a car I was Always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Heidrun Walter says this as an example of how it is less stressful to walk places and hear the sounds of nature rather than feel the responsibility and worry that comes with driving her children place to place.

Another reason why it is more advantageous to limit the usage of cars is that it makes people be forced to start working on healthy habits walking, riding bikes as well as keeps pollution levels down with car pooling and other different means of travel. ""Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spears to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota This car free day program in Bogota is a good example of how people choose healthier ways to get around the city. Skating hiking and biking are all great ways to get around the city to work because they cause the person commuting by these methods to exersise. Also, if some peopkle so choose to take the bus, they are still helping to make the city, and world, more healthy by reducing the amount of pollution. There are also trends within the youth of the United States that shows a decrease in wanting to drive. ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 1639yearolds getting a license..."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture This shows a distinct drop in the number of new aged drivers getting their license. Most teenagers these days don'r see the big deal in driving as was seen when it was a new phenominon. ""He Mr. Sivak and I have similar observations about our children. Mine 19 and 21 have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy."" This was stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal Source 4: The End of Car Culture Rosenthal isn't the only parent to see a decline in the interest to drive from their kids. Many people have arguments with their children everyday trying to get them to drive, but there is far less of an interest from teenagers anymore. Most young people see a car as ""just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesnt work."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture With this disinterest, there could be a large decrease in the pollution given off by cars, and cause a much healthier future for Earth and the people who inhabit it.

In conclusion, by limiting the usage of cars we would be given several advantages. Of these advantages are a healthier life style, and the reduction of pollution and smog. Both of these would lead to a happier and healthier Earth for humans, and the future of human kind to exist and live on.",0
"The electoral college has many inherent flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttal to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unnecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?

Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes tenfold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.",0
"Dear Senator of the United States, I am a student in Miami Senior High School and I've been learning a lot about the Electoral College Vote. I know that the Electoral College is a process in the system and it consists of the selection of the electors and you don't want to get rid of it but I've got some reasons why you should remove it.

I've been reading about the Electoral College Vote and I found a passage that is full of details about how the Electoral College is affecting us, the citizens of the United States. The passage, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", states that, ""thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This is trying to say that the citizens don't like the fact that we don't even vote for a president anymore, we just vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college vote isn't giving us the opportunity to pick a president we want to win and we sometimes even get confused about the electors and the candidate we decide to choose. This makes it really hard for all of us to have the rights of voting.

Also, I found another quote that supports our thoughts, it says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" What we're trying to say is that we need a chance in choosing who we want to win in an election. In my opinion, the electoral college vote is unfair to all the voters. Most citizens do agree with what Bob Dole said one day: ""Abolish the electoral college!"" To sum it all up, there are some positive things about the electoral college. In the passage I found called ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" says that, ""Obama received 61. 7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney.."". However, we just want the electoral college vote to be abolished because the citizens would appreciate to have a chance in voting for a president by our opinion. I think that the popular vote is a better way to let us do this because it depends on the voters and who they chose for. This way, it will be equal for all of us.

I would like to thank you for taking your time to read this letter and to think about the thoughts that some of the citizens in the United States have in mind. Your service is appreciated by all of us.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can improve air quality, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. This can be seen in examples from around the world, such as Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are a major contributor to global warming. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In the United States, car-intensive areas can contribute up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In her article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer explains how a partial driving ban in Paris resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and significantly reduced smog levels. Similarly, Andrew Selsky discusses the popularity of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leading to clear streets and reduced traffic jams. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can lead to cleaner air and a healthier environment for all.

Moreover, limiting car usage can promote a more active and healthier lifestyle. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""The End of Car Culture,"" she highlights the decrease in car ownership, fewer miles driven, and a decline in the number of licenses being acquired in the United States. This shift in behavior suggests a cultural shift towards alternative modes of transportation. The presence of more bike paths, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and improved public transport options can encourage people to walk, bike, or use public transport more frequently, resulting in increased physical activity and improved overall health.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can improve air quality, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Examples from around the world, such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. It is clear that embracing alternative modes of transportation is not only beneficial for the planet but also for our own well-being.",1
"The Electoral College is how America votes for the President and Vise President, which is a process that the U.S. shouldn't have. initially, if people are voting for a President, they know what they want and have done their research. Along with that, it gives the electoral College more rights than the actually people voting for the President and Vise President. Lastly, it's just down right unfair to the voters. The U.S. wants every person to have equal chance at the election for a president and if about 500 people are voting compared to the millions, it's just unfair to the citizens. In the world now, this process is taking away the freedom of decision or making it seem useless to the people. The electoral College shouldn't be a process we use for voting.

Most people voting, actually care who is running the country and they took the effort to make sure they got the vote in. The votes from the actually people should count because, evidently, they know what they want. Most people do not go to a place if they do not care for the purpose, but if citizens are voting for their president, it should count, not having other elected officials vote. The elected officials voting, are in the government and that creates a biased vote which is uncalled for. The votes need to be from the people because they see the actual truths of what is happening to the economy, salary, taxes, the process of the government, and much more. It is obvious that having the people vote is a more efficient choice than preelected officials.

Secondly, the electoral college takes away the rights to choose what president they want. Yes, they get to vote for which electoral college member they want but, it doesn't actually add up to the number the citizens actually participate in. As stated in the Constitution, citizens of America have freedom, and they should have the freedom of choosing the Preseident and Vice President they want without out any ifs,ands, or buts. America has the freedom to choose and the electoral College shuts it all down, which is disrespect to citizens and to the country.

Lastly, it is such an unfair process. As said previously, it geneuinly takes our freedom of choice away. People need to be heard and listened for what they actually want but the government lives their own way and doesn't take into count what the people, that make the country up, want. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the laidback defenses of the syster are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This here proves that the candidates are only in for the game and not the real true choice in who will be a perfect official that runs the country all together. Clearly, the process all together is a complete unfair, brutial game to the people.

In Retrospect, having the electoral College is a disaster and having it as a process makes we use every four years is unbelieveable. It treats the Americans like there freedom is worthless and makes the voting process unfair. If the people take the time to actually stand in line to vote, they hould earn the right of having their vote count in full picture. This process shouldn't continue on, for it is 500 or so people voting for the President and Vise President for over millions. That itself, is outragious and shouldn't be apart of the American voting process anymore.",0

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my thoughts and concerns regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in the provided texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is typically higher than their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear victor. This helps to avoid political gridlock and potential legal battles that could arise from close popular vote margins.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is ""everyone's President,"" as Judge Posner points out. With its requirement for trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates with only regional favoritism from winning the presidency. This is crucial in a diverse nation like ours because a president elected via popular vote may not necessarily represent the interests and concerns of all regions equally. By requiring broad support across multiple states, the Electoral College ensures that the President governs with a national perspective.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. One of the main criticisms of the Electoral College is that it leads to candidates exclusively focusing on a few swing states during their campaigns. However, this also means that voters in those crucial states receive the most attention and information from the candidates. These voters are likely to be more informed and thoughtful, which ultimately benefits the democratic process.

Fourthly, the Electoral College provides a balance of power for big states. It is no secret that large states hold significant political influence due to their population size. However, the Electoral College allows smaller states to have a proportional say by granting them more electoral votes per capita. This prevents large states from dominating the political landscape and ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and communities during their campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. With this system in place, there is a reduced likelihood of multiple candidates running with no clear majority winner. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections, allowing for a smoother transition of power and maintaining the stability of the presidential election process.

While some argue that a popular vote system would be more fair and democratic, it is important to consider the potential disadvantages. As mentioned in Bradford Plumer's article, a popular vote system could lead to a disastrous outcome, such as when state legislatures have the power to select electors. It also has the potential to disenfranchise voters in regions that have no chance of electing a president, leading to a decrease in voter turnout.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College provides an effective and balanced method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College offers greater stability and representation for all citizens. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the information provided and make the best decision for our state and our nation.

"Every four years there is an election. The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years. The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections. The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use. On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results. One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal. This is crucial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" Posner. With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them. Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes. It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" Posner. Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory. Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair. It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win. In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes. This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency Plumer. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates. If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them. The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" Plumer. The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation. All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign. With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states."" They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote. In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited. Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina Plumer. Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision. Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign. A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" Posner. Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President. To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College. The President of the United States plays an important role in our country. The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country. It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This essay will explore the benefits of reducing automobile dependency, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and the creation of more pedestrian-friendly communities.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing automobile dependency, communities can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. This reduction in emissions can have a positive impact on air quality as well.

The improvement in air quality is another advantage of limiting car usage. In Robert Duffer's article, it is mentioned that the smog in Paris reached levels comparable to Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The main culprit for this smog was diesel fuel, which France heavily favors over gasoline due to tax policies. By decreasing car usage, especially diesel-fueled vehicles, communities can improve air quality and reduce the negative health effects associated with pollution.

Promotion of alternative transportation is another crucial advantage of limiting car usage. Andrew Selsky's article describes the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This event aimed to reduce smog and promote public transportation. By limiting car usage, communities can encourage the use of more sustainable modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides individuals with healthier and more environmentally-friendly options for getting around.

Additionally, limiting car usage can contribute to the creation of more pedestrian-friendly communities. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article about the German suburb of Vauban, it is mentioned that street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in this car-free community. Instead, large garages are provided at the edge of the development, emphasizing the prioritization of pedestrians and public transportation. This approach allows for the design of communities that are compact, walkable, and accessible to public transportation. By limiting car usage, communities can create safer and more enjoyable environments for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of alternative transportation, and the creation of more pedestrian-friendly communities. By reducing automobile dependency and embracing sustainable transportation options, individuals and communities can contribute to a healthier environment and a more enjoyable way of life. It is imperative that society recognizes the benefits of limiting car usage and takes active steps towards achieving a more sustainable future.",1
"Hot topics in todayas world are pollution and global warming. While there is still debate, many people agree that cutting down societyas use of cars would help the world be a better place. Greater limitation of car use will reduce pollution and better society.

To commence, reduction of car use will reduce pollution. Pollution is essentially hurting the planet as a whole, as well as all the organisms living in it. In fact, Paris, France, has recently taken action against car use effectively. According to Robert Duffer, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In only a few days, after banning half of the diesel and gasrun cars in the cities per day, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" If such a change can happen in under a week, the entire world could benefit greatly from adopting similar policies. In the U.S, things are also turning around for the better. According to as article, ""The End of Car Culture,"" ""transportation is the second largest source of Americaas emissions, just behind power plants."" This is largely due to car culture in the U.S, which is fortunately declining. In fact, in the same article, it is said ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" This shows that America is well on itas way to becoming a greener nation without having to make dramatic changes to itas way of life.

Continuing, more limited car use can better society, or at least work in a community. Society is currently too dependant on cars. However, Vauban, Germany is starting to change that. In another New York Times article, Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""70 percent of Vaubanas families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The remaining thirty percent of people hardly use their own cars for anything more than distant traveling, as most of Vaubanas streets are ""carfree."" This can show that a population of people, in this case over 5,000 of them can survive without constantly being behind a wheel. In another case, in Bogota, Columbia, there is a designated holiday to celebrate not using cars. Appropriately titled, ""Day Without Cars"" is an annual event held in order ""to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,"" according to the Andrew Selsky. While it may sound silly, the event had a huge turnout in spite of bad weather. Other cities joined into the fun after a few years, and also in the article, Enrique rivera, the mayor of a Paraguay town, said of the event, ""'These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.'"" The simple effort to better the world has brought people together for a good cause.

In retrospect, the idea of declining the use of cars will help humanity as a whole greatly. Doing so would simultaneously slow down the destruction of the Earth for all organisms inside of it, and also help the human race better itself socially.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States, despite the calls for its abolition. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, strikes a balance between election by Congress and election by popular vote, ensuring fair representation and protecting the interests of all states.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcomes. The possibility of dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is significantly lower than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, due to the winner-take-all basis of awarding electoral votes. This system creates a clear victory and prevents elections from becoming uncertain and contentious.

Additionally, the Electoral College system ensures that every region is represented in the election process. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, necessitating candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign across various states, preventing them from focusing solely on regions where they are already popular. By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of regions, the Electoral College guarantees that the President is perceived as representing the interests of the entire nation rather than just a particular region or group.

Moreover, the Electoral College system directs candidates to pay attention to swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on states that are closely contested. This means that voters in swing states receive greater attention from candidates, leading to more informed and thoughtful decision-making. Swing state voters, being crucial in determining the outcome, are more likely to engage in the political process and make well-informed choices.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not disadvantaged in the election process due to the apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College grants more weight to large states, as they have a larger number of electoral votes. This balance helps in offsetting the influence of small states, ensuring that presidential campaigns are not exclusively focused on states with larger populations. By providing a balanced distribution of attention, the Electoral College system promotes the interests of all states, regardless of their size.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This reduces the complexity and costs associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more efficient and decisive outcome. The Electoral College serves as a safeguard against prolonged election cycles without compromising the democratic nature of the process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system is unfair and outdated, I contend that it ensures fair representation, guarantees certainty of outcomes, encourages trans-regional appeal, protects swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Preserving the Electoral College is essential in upholding democratic principles and protecting the interests of all states.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College system when making decisions that will impact our nation's electoral process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear Senator Don Gates, There has been many arguments about whether or not to keep the electoral college or to change the election process by popular vote. The best way to go would be to use popular vote. The Electoral College is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Plumer, paragraph 14. There are so many reasons as to why you should change to popular vote, When you vote for your candidate, you're actually voting for your candidates electors, sometimes the state legislatures pick the electors, and also its an unfair process to voters. The Electoral College needs to be booted out!

When you go to vote, you think that you are directly voting for your candidates, that is no the case. You are actually voting for your candidates electors. You cannot control who your electors vote for either. They do not always vote for the same person you want them to. Voters may sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This has happened. If the process were done by popular vote then their wouldnt be these problems taking place.

Who picks the electors? Sometimes it is the State legislatures. They are responsible. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" , it states that in 1960, segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones that would then oppose John F. Kennedy. This was so a popular vote would not go to Kennedy. Also it was stated that ""faithless"" electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please. This doesn seem fair to the people.

The whole process of the Electoral College is ""unfair to voters"". There is a reason behind this accusation. The winnertakeall system to be more precise. Candidates dont spend time in states that they know they have not a slight chance of winning, they tend to focus more on the ""swing"" states. During a campaign in 2000, seventeen states didnt get to see candidates at all. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. As it was stated in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", ""If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it..."".

The Electoral College is not the best way to decide who runs our military, or nation. We need a way to have a fair and equal vote. Popular vote is the way. Though the electoral college is a quick and easier way to get votes in, it isnt very efficient. The process isnt fair to the people at all, you're not directly voting for the candidate of your choice, and state legislatures, who have opinions, pick the elctors.",0

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is essential in maintaining the integrity and fairness of our presidential elections.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the purpose and history of the Electoral College, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register in their publication ""What Is the Electoral College?"" The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, allowing for an equitable representation of both states and individuals. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. This system ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election process, preventing larger states from dominating the outcomes. Critics argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, but its purpose is to protect the interests of all states and promote national unity.

One of the main concerns raised by opponents of the Electoral College is the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency, as mentioned in Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" While this has occurred on rare occasions, it is crucial to note that such cases are infrequent. The current system ensures the certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes and confusion. In addition, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing candidates from focusing solely on highly populated areas and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populated states. As Judge Richard A. Posner states in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" this system encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, thereby promoting inclusivity and preventing regional disengagement.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system protects swing states, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates must address the concerns and desires of a broader range of voters. This encourages voters in these states to become more engaged and informed about the candidates and their policies. Without the Electoral College, candidates would concentrate their efforts on densely populated urban areas, potentially leaving rural and less populous areas marginalized and unheard.

The Electoral College also provides an important balance of power between large and small states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner. The system properly acknowledges the constitutional provision of equal representation for each state in the Senate. This prevents candidates from solely targeting large states, making smaller states relevant and their interests considered. It also discourages the need for run-off elections, which could complicate the election process and lead to further polarization within the country.

Although critics argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters, particularly in states that are consistently favorable towards one party, it is worth noting that the voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, as explained by Judge Richard A. Posner. Voters understand the significance of expressing their political preference. Furthermore, a popular vote system could result in only highly populated states receiving campaign attention, leaving other states feeling neglected and rendering their voters irrelevant.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a balance of power, ensuring regional inclusivity, and promoting national unity. It protects the voice of smaller states, encourages trans-regional appeal, and maintains certainty of outcome. While some reforms may be necessary to address certain concerns and make the system more efficient, completely abandoning the Electoral College would undermine the principles and values upon which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh these arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College. It is my hope that you will continue to support this important aspect of our democratic process.

Yours sincerely,

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, serves as a vital safeguard to our democratic process and ensures fair representation for all states.

First and foremost, it is essential to understand the purpose of the Electoral College. As explained by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College was created as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. Its process includes the selection of electors, their vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system allows for a balance of power between smaller and larger states, preventing tyranny of the majority.

Proponents of abolishing the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and unfair to voters. However, Judge Richard A. Posner highlights the practical reasons for retaining it. One crucial reason is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the electoral vote have occurred, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes creates a clear winner and avoids the complexities of run-off elections.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region's interests are considered. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on solid regional support. As stated by Judge Posner, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. This system fosters representation for all regions and prevents potential disenfranchisement of voters from certain parts of the country.

Additionally, by focusing campaign efforts on swing states, candidates engage with more thoughtful voters who pay closer attention to their policies and messages. This, in turn, leads to a more informed electorate and better decision-making during the election. The Electoral College encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states and provides an opportunity for diverse voices to be heard.

Lastly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of large and small states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, it restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. The electoral vote system ensures that candidates pay attention to diverse states with varying populations, rather than solely focusing on populous regions.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as an essential component of our democratic system. It maintains fair representation for all states, prevents potential disputes over election outcomes, ensures trans-regional appeal in candidates, encourages thoughtful voter engagement, and balances the political influence of large and small states. While there may be valid concerns and criticisms, the benefits provided by the Electoral College outweigh any perceived drawbacks. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I strongly urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and advocate for its continued importance in our electoral process.

Sincerely,

"Dear Florida state senator, In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable decisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final decision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is an idea gaining traction around the world as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on the information presented in the passage set.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a considerable portion of these emissions, with Europe attributing 12 percent and some car-intensive areas in the United States up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions to automobiles (Passage 5). By promoting alternatives to car ownership and usage, communities can contribute to a significant reduction in carbon footprints and combat climate change effectively.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality
Limiting car usage also has a direct positive impact on air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to severe smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality (Passage 14). This measure demonstrates that reducing car usage, even temporarily, can have an immediate and tangible benefit in terms of cleaner air. Implementing similar initiatives in other cities can significantly improve public health by reducing respiratory illnesses caused by pollution.

Body Paragraph 3: Increased Accessibility to Public Transportation
Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative means of transportation, such as public transit. The German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, exemplifies this approach (Passage 2). By designing communities with proximity to public transportation systems, residents have greater accessibility and are more likely to utilize buses, trams, and trains. This shift can result in decreased traffic congestion, reduced carbon emissions, and improved mobility for individuals who may not have access to private vehicles.

Body Paragraph 4: Enhanced Quality of Life
Limiting car usage also offers an improved quality of life for residents. In Vauban, where a majority of families have given up car ownership, residents reported feeling less stressed and happier (Passage 3). The absence of cars creates a quieter and safer environment, encouraging more active modes of transportation, such as walking and biking. Additionally, proximity to essential services, like stores and amenities, promotes a sense of community and fosters healthier lifestyles.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various communities worldwide. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting alternative transportation options, and enhancing the quality of life for residents, limiting car usage can contribute significantly to a sustainable and vibrant future. Governments, city planners, and individuals must rally behind these methods, adopting smart planning principles and prioritizing people-centered development to ensure a cleaner, healthier, and more accessible environment for all.",1
"The time for the automobile is slowly passing. More and more people prefer carpooling and walking then driving a car. Why is that? It could be due to the unemployment rate skyrocketing or less people wanting a car. There are many benefits to driving a car. Being able to get to point A to point B, faster travel time, and it is more private than a bus. But what are the downsides? Pollution, more antisocial humans, and the cacophony of horns and engines. Giving up the car should be on every countries todo list.

Some nations, such as Paris, France, find out about the downside of cars the hardway. Pollution is a very real problem in todays society. In 2014 the city had a nearrecord high of pollution, rivaling Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world source 2. After debating, the French ruling party decided to ban driving for odd and even licence plate numbers on opposite days until the smog count went down. It took five days, but they managed to have most of the smog cleared. Decisions like these cause controversy everywhere, but we have a responsibility to our planet not to destroy it with greenhouse gases.

In a suburb in Germany, they have a carfree neighborhood. They are allowed to own cars but it costs 40,000 and they can only park at the edge of the neighborhood. This alone caused 70% of the neighborhood to not own cars source 1. A woman in Vauban,the neighborhood,said that not owning a car makes her less tense and more happy. With this you can conclude that most of her neighbors feel this way also, otherwise they wouldn't have moved there. Having less stressed people, less polluted airways and less car accidents always sounds like a good solution to me.

In a city in Columbia they have a carfree day, where cars are banned from the city source 3. Even though it was rainy it did not stop people from participating at all. In fact, it has even spread across its borders. A businessman said this was a good way to lower stress swell. Without cars, this city has seen more bikeway paths, parks and community centers being built and rush hour traffic being cut down dramtically. This new trend has promoted people to be more healthy and social. Not only has this affected the airs it has affected business. With more people walking, new restaurants and shopping centers have cropped up. Having more and more people spending their money helps their nations economy in great ways.

After all this evidence the only conclusion we can come to is that having less cars would help humans immensly. Not only does it promote physical exercise but but cuts down on polution. Yes, it would have hurt car manufacturers but the businessmen don't exactly just lay down and take it. Bill Ford has already suggested working with the new trend source 4. Without cars the obesity problem, especially in America, would decrease. As well as the number of asthmatic people. Taking this data and doing something with it would not only help the life living on this planet, but it would help the planet too.",0

The actoions toaken began too change tohe tohoughtos of tohe citoizens and creatoe a petorifying conclusion tohato tohe man was noto on tohe run too be everyone's presidento. This dilemma could have been changed around if rodney had shown tohato he had cared more for his stoatoe and his countory and tohoughto more abouto tohe needs he could fill and tohe actoions he could improve, tohen many of tohe votoers would have mosto likely shown repsecto and a desire for tohe man too be choosen as toheir new presidento. On tohe opposing hand rodney had noto shown any of tohose qualitoies or passion which had caused for him too be tohoughto of as unresponsible and selfish.

The countory has more tohan tohousands and tohousands of people too serve and directo. Ito can be understoood tohato having a large amounto of citoizens can resulto in uncertoaintoy toowards tohe electoion and tohe votoes casto, yeto ito is yeto too be changed too a more reasonable way of confrontoing ito. Witoh many systoems such as ""WinnerTake All"" due too stoatoes toitoled as tohe ""Swing Stoatoes,"" ito can be an untorustowortohy electoion fo many votoers around tohe countory. The electoion process noto only need too be changed too selecto a more responsible candidatoe, buto too creatoe a more torustowortohy systoem of itoself.

There is very litotole equalitoy when ito comes too electoions especially, when tohe stoatoes are giving an unreliable systoem too choose for tohem. Stoatoes tohato are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded tohe systoem named ""WinnerTakesAll"" due too how tohey apparentoly pay closer atotoentoion too tohe campaign. In tohe artoicle Whato Is The electooral College by tohe office of tohe Federal Registoer, tohe metohod is firsto intoroduced in paragraph 7. Stoatoing tohato tohe purpose of tohe ""WinnerTakeAll"" systoem is noto only,buto too award all electoors too tohe winning candidatoe. Ito is said too be unreliable and untorustowortohy due too ito's focus on stoatoes tohato appear to have more atotoentoion toowards tohe electoion. On a more basic level, some stoatoes such as Rhode Island and Soutoh Carolina had noto even witoness tohe campaign and even leaving a few votoers too have no say. Going back too tohe misunderstoanding of tohe electoion of rodney,tohe countory witotonessed an iresponsible candidatoe tohato had ran for presidento. Witoh tohe unreliable ridiculous systoem ""WinnerTakeAll"" some stoatoes may or may noto have even experienced how rodney had actoed and his intoentoions toowards tohe electoions and tohe campaign. Witoh very litotole knowledge of tohe presidentoial candidatoe and witoh limitoatoions of votoing and campaign ads, tohere is very litotole torusto given toowards tohe electoion process especially witoh more tohan a few stoatoes tohato are noto being toaken very seriously, witoh very litotole say. If tohe Electoorial College could give off more informatoion and more become more reliable toowards all stoatoes, tohe process would be less sinistoer and more apreciatoed.

There are many more otoher factoors in which tohe Electoorial College musto be changed too meeto tohe appropriatoe dilemmas and needs of tohe votoers and toheir intoentoions toowards tohe campaign. On tohe otoher hand, ito has noto changed ato all only too stoay unfair toowards tohe entoire countory and possibly cause a catoastorophe.

Leto us say, tohere have been many incidentos where electoions have been on tohe edge of a major dilemma. Wondering why a storaighto up orderly process can go too tohe pointo of a catoastorophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.

Why Even The BestoLaid Defesnes of tohe systoem are wrong by Bradford Plumer, stoatoes back too tohe disatoer factoor of tohe electoion of John F.Kennedy. Ito stoatoes back too tohe 1960's where faitohless electoors had pushed aside tohe votoes and sayings of Louisiana had decided too votoe for whomever tohey had wantoed. Ito had caused a problem of course since tohe votoes where noto even of tohe people, buto of tohe selfish sick minds of tohe electoors who tooke tohe process intoo toheir own hands. In tohe same paragraph ito stoaes back too when tohe stoatoe of Hawaii had sento in towo slatoes of electoors too congress. Witoh tohe unreliable actoions of Richard Nixion, had validatoed his opponento's electoors of course too win over tohe campaign. once again anotoher issue arises in tohe artoicle Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Metohod Of Choosing The Presidento, ito agrees witoh tohe unfairness of tohe electoorals by giving tohe example of how tohe Electoorial College had tourned off tohe potoentoial votoers due too tohe knowledge tohato toheir votoes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, ito stoatoes tohato in tohe stoatoe of Texas, ito was known tohato tohe votoes would have know effecto of tohe campaign whato so ever. Ito aslo had stoaes tohato votoers in politocal electoions have no care ratoher tohan too express tohe politoical refrence tohan whato tohe peole tohink or decide. This sums up tohato tohe process is unfair too many of tohe stoatoes votoers and musto be changed too become more open and share tohe equalitoy witoh tohose who are losing tohier torusto.

In conclusion, tohe Electoorial College muto be changed too meeto tohe need of tohose who agree tohato is ito irresponsible when givng a repsonisble presidento, a more torustoworhtoy electoion and an unfair process. Yeto tohis can all be fixed simply by changing tohe ways ito is run and too give more freedom for tohe people.",0
"Driving a car around can be very a affective aspect in people's lives it can also be a very stressful and dangerous liferisking task to do each and every day. All across America, citizens are constantly driving their cars. A car can be used to go to work, to the grocery store, or to drop a loved one off to school and even other places. It is to the point were a simple car has become an important necessity to manage everyday life. It is also to a point at which every year cars are responsible for thousands of deaths and accidents. If people around the world limited their car usage everyday it could significantly better our lives.

Clear the air. Pollution from cars has severely polluted the air we breathe and our environment. Beijing, China is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world and has been effected my the smog. Many places around the world are trying to make a difference in their environment by trying to get citizens in that area to limit their driving. According to an excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris has enforced a parital driving ban to help clean the air of the global city. As stated in the excerpt, ""On Monday motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Just because of that one action congestion in the capital of France was down 60 percent and as time goes by the air will start to clear up faster.

If one had the opportunity to take away stress while lower the air pollution, would the do it? In Bogota, Colombia once a year millions of Columbians take part in a day without cars know as carfree day. As stated the the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky the goal of the carfree day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Many citizens of Colombia take advantage of the day by hiking, biking, skating or taking buses to work, which benefits one's health and is a great source of excessive. Because of this day many parks and sports centers have opened, sidewalks have been replaced, and rushhour restrictions have created a better flow in traffic.

Putting away something you constantly use everyday can be a difficult thing to do but it is worth it in the end. Minimizing the use of cars can greatly reduce the amount of polluion of the air. If we all comply with is task year by year our air will get cleaner and the environment will be better.",0
"Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the ""...birth place of the Model Tthe home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""mustang Sally'""The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal Cars and automobile have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been steadily decreasing and for all the right reasons.

A new movement is trending everywhere,it's called ""smart planning"". It's simple, separate suburban life from auto use. In doing so this movement is going to help out the economy and also the environment. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" emphasis on original That many emissionsarehorrible for the environment and even worse for our pockets, because they're just going up in smoke.New citiesare rising and are acctuly trying to adopt this trend by making cities denser, which means that all the stores and your work place are in walking distance. By being able to walk to your local shopping store or favorite move theatre means that you're saving gas, and by saving gas the ecodimey is saving money which will make prices in all the stores and other businesses cheaper for the consumer, you!

The infamous smog is not only in Bejing, or the United States, but also in The City of Love. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."" Paragraph 17, Duffer The city is not so lovely as you'd think it would be, but the trend has cought onin Paris! Not only that but it also has been great for the environment. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...The smog rivaled Begjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Paragraph 14, Duffer Most people would think ""I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!"" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and ""...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog."" Paragraph 21, Selsky Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the environment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Paragraph 28, Selsky Just one day a week could cut down smog and other green house gasses a lot and help our enviromentand the edodomey.

Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work."" Paragraph 35, Rosenthal Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe 10 on gas that day you're missing out on the 125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Carpool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money. Once a week you could to this to stop in increes of smog in our environment and even help with traffic jams. And without traffic jams eveyone is less stressed out and a lot more happier.

By not using our cars as much,we can help ourselves and everyone aroud us by making a better world that makes it better for our children, or even our childrens' children. We can save money by just taking one day off of not driving. We should limit car use so we can stop car accedents from happening, getting stressed in traffic jams, to helping out the economical heart of the United States,and just to make our world a better place to have fun and thrivein.",0
"""Less Cars"" ""Vrroooom vroom,"" that is all that people hear when they step outside in the city along with honks and angry people, and police chasing people speeding. What if that was not what you had to hear all the time? What if that sounds would only be heard once every few hours or days? Thus can be a reality with limitation of car usage people would be happier, there would be less smog in the sky, the global health would go up.

With less cars comes less trouble. in Andrew Selsky's artical ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" he states "" millions of Colombians Hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work tduring carfree day"" this caused the ""streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Because of the carfree day there were less people on the road, less traffic, and less stress about getting to work. When there is no one driving and almost everyone is taking bikes or walking, it seems like it would make small sidewalks congested it does not, because, as Andrew Selsky says, ""throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..."" This helps make transit even easier and less hectic. In Elisabeth Rosanthal's artical, ""In German Suburb, Life Gose On Without Cars,"" she asked someone in a carless community how they felt about not having a car, she said ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" People are happier without cars and without the stress that comes with them. Having less cars would also make places less polluted.

With less cars there would be less pollution in the air and less greenhouse gases that we would emit as a society. In Robert buffer's artical, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" he states that "" after days of nearrecord pollution"" in Paris the city officials ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In Paris action was only taken when the smog made carrying out their day difficult, instead of before it got to that point. Some might say that if the imediate threat had not been there none of the citizens would have lisened to the ban but they might listen to the banning of cars now that they see how bad it can get. In Bogota, Andrew Selsky states that ""the goal of the Day Without Cars is to promote alternitive transportation and reduce smog."" This helps the enviroment and the people living there, especially those with asthma and those with heart disease can develop better exercise habits.

With less cars means more walking and less greenhouse gases. Many of the people that do not choose to ride the bus or a taxi, as Andrew Selsky says, ""hiked, biked"" or ""skated. This means that these people were exercising and getting fit, even if it was just one day. Imagine if it was not just one day though what if carfree day was carfree week, or month. This would decrease obesity in children and adults, along with lowering the hisk for heart contitions. Carfree weeks or months would make the enviroment better but also make it better for people with asthma. Less smog would mean people with asthma would be able to breathe easier in places like New York. Improving the health of people on a global scale.

Limiting car usage would be an amazing thing if it was on a global scale. Carfree days once every year are a great start to improving the planet. Car limitation would mean happier people, less pollution in the sky, and an improved standard of living. Less cars equal a better planet for every one.",0
"Dear Senator, I, STUDENT_NAME, am in favor of changing our democracy to popular vote. Electoral college does no good to our society. It's out of date, it's irrational, everybody in this case has a great chance of becoming president. That is no good, we do not need idiots running our country. Election by popular vote is the best way to go. You will have a certain outcome and votes will be fairly made. It benefits everybody. More than half of our population wants you guys to make the switch.

The electoral college is not an up to date voting method. Our founding fathers made it many years ago while writing the constitution. It is a long process of nonsense that has no advantages to us, the people. By popular vote, it's faster, simpler, and better. Popular vote is basically a group of qualified citizens voting for the president. Popular vote is the best way for people to directly voice their opinions by picking the president of their choice. If we use the Electoral college, the electors of our state may not deliever it properly.

Over 60 percent of voters prefer direct elections. Government officials such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others all thought we should abolish the electoral college. Many things are wrong with the electoral college, we don't directly vote for the president but for the slate of electors, who eventually vote for the president. It in no way benefits the people, they have no control over who the electors pick. In many cases, people have decided to not even vote because there was no hope.

If there are greater chances of everybody being president, not only is there a fool running the country,he isn't going to worry about your interests or needs. If your own president won't help your interests, potential voters may be turned off. Isn't that horrible, to feel that our president isn't our president? Knowing that our vote will have less of an elect, we won't want to vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who have something to say and actually want to express themselves. They are not the people who don't care and just vote to vote.

You and the rest of the senate should consider this very deeply. It isn't just benefiting the people, but congress, the whole senate and most importantly, the president. It will make us a better nation and one as a whole. I hope you take this into great consideration and make the change. The only way to get back the peoples trust and votes is by taking baby steps. This is one great step and good things may come out of this.",0
"Dear Senator, I want to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it is easier and makes a lot more sense. When you vote by the Electoral College, you are actually voting for your candidates electors. When you vote for the electors, it doesn't necessarily mean they will vote for their candidate. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, as stated in ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" There is a single argument against the Electoral College is best known as the disaster factor. In 1960, segregationists who were in the Louisiana Legislature succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. They did this so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In almost the same way, ""faithless"" electors sometimes refuse to vote for their party's candidate. Instead they cast a deciding vote for whoever they want.

The electors and segregationists in the Electoral College think they can do whatever they please. They make decisions that wouldn't be fair to the voters or the candidates. If the voter votes for a certain candidate but the elector votes for a different candidate, this could cause trouble and madness within the election. The Electoral College is not always fair. However, if we switch to the election of the popular votes, the election would be fair. The candidates would be chosen based on the number of votes they got from voters, not by who the electors want to vote for.

People also worry about the prospect of a tie in the Electoral College. If this happens, the election would be handed over to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote on the president. In this case, the Senate would choose the vicepresident.""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative in Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". From this context, we can say that the House's selection can barely be expected to reflect the will of the people.

I think the Electoral College is not accurate and the electors in it are not very fair. If someone elects a certain candidate, but the elector votes for someone else, there really isn't a purpose for people to vote. If people don't vote, then our country won't have a president. The Electoral College can take this country downhill in several ways. We should let the people decide who they want to run their country. That way, the voting will be more fair, easier, and not as many bad things could happen while the process of voting is going on. I think the Electoral College should not be the way that our country's citizens should vote by.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the question of whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After reviewing the information from various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained. While there are arguments to be made for a popular vote system, the Electoral College provides several important benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an election is less likely compared to a direct popular vote system. The winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states also creates landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied national electoral vote. This certainty of outcome helps maintain stability and avoids prolonged disputes and uncertainty following elections.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Because no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must appeal to voters across different states and regions. This requirement ensures that the president has broader support and considers the interests of different regions of the country. Without the Electoral College, candidates with strong regional appeal could win the popular vote by focusing solely on their strongholds, potentially leaving other regions feeling disenfranchised and ignored.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives greater attention to swing states. In a winner-takes-all system, candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This focus ensures that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to a more informed and thoughtful electorate. By giving greater weight to the concerns and interests of these swing states, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a significant say in the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states. While the Senate already provides some degree of balance between large and small states, the Electoral College further ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of larger states. In the Electoral College system, winning a small state by a slight margin may provide fewer electoral votes compared to winning a large state by the same margin. This motivates candidates to consider the needs and issues of larger states in their campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can complicate the election process. The Electoral College guarantees a clear winner by rarely allowing a candidate to win the electoral vote without securing a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the need for further elections and ensures a smoother transition of power.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage some voters in non-competitive states from participating, the overall voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. This suggests that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, regardless of their state's electoral outcome. Additionally, efforts can be made to promote engagement and increase voter turnout in all states, regardless of their electoral competitiveness.

In conclusion, despite the criticism that the Electoral College has received, it provides crucial benefits that should not be overlooked. From ensuring certainty of outcome to promoting trans-regional appeal and preventing run-off elections, the Electoral College serves an important role in our democracy. While there may be merits to the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the advantages of the Electoral College outweigh the potential drawbacks. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important issue. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.

Sincerely,

"The Electoral College was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own. And in that time, it made sense. It made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president, the electors, were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues. However, now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet, newspapers and television, this is no longer a problem this is why election by popular vote would be a better system.

With the Electoral College, voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president. They have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know. People who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want. This system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics.

If our nation switched to election by popular vote, everyone's vote would matter. In the Electoral College system, many people in states that are decisively one way or the other, don't vote, knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them. This makes certain people, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, feel that their vote has no power. In an election by popular vote however, every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president.

Our Founding Fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time, however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world. The Electoral College eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them. This is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the Electoral College.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and urge you to consider the benefits it brings to the presidential election process. While there are arguments for both keeping the Electoral College and changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides a more balanced and fair representation of the American people's voices.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it offers. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the election result is more predictable and less likely to be disputed compared to a direct popular vote system, as seen in the 2000 election. The winner-take-all method in most states also creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate, further solidifying their legitimacy as the chosen president.

Another important factor to consider is that the Electoral College ensures that the president-elect has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to solely determine the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to campaign across different regions and appeal to a diverse range of voters. A candidate with broad appeal is more likely to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation and avoid regional biases.

The Electoral College also emphasizes the importance of swing states, as pointed out by Judge Posner. Toss-up states receive more attention from candidates, leading voters in these states to be more engaged in the campaign and make thoughtful decisions. This focus on swing states ensures that the candidates address the concerns and interests of a wider range of voters, resulting in a more representative outcome for the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big states and small states in the political process. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate favors smaller states, the Electoral College allows larger states to maintain influence by granting them more electoral votes. This system ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are taken into account during presidential campaigns, preventing a disproportionate concentration of power.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This saves time and resources, allowing for a smoother and more efficient election process. The winner of the electoral vote is the clear victor, avoiding potential political gridlock and uncertainty.

While arguments can be made against the Electoral College, such as the limited attention paid to non-swing states or the potential disenfranchisement of voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to consider the overall benefits of the system. The Electoral College provides a balanced representation of the American people's preferences, ensures the certainty of the election outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, gives weight to swing states, balances the influence of big and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic process and should be retained. It offers a fair and representative system for electing the president, while addressing the practical challenges and complexities of the election process. I trust that as my senator, you will consider these factors when making decisions related to the Electoral College. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College or, alternatively, changing to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that it is essential to carefully consider the arguments from both sides before making a decision that will impact the future of our democratic process. In this letter, I will present the case for both perspectives using evidence from multiple sources.

One of the main reasons for keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to those over the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system used by most states ensures that a slight plurality in a state results in a substantial electoral-vote victory. While a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely. Thus, the Electoral College ensures a decisive outcome in presidential elections.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to make every citizen feel represented. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. As a result, candidates are motivated to campaign in various regions, ensuring that the interests of all citizens are taken into account. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on winning states with heavy party affiliations and neglecting the concerns of other regions. Consequently, the Electoral College promotes a sense of inclusivity and prevents regional divides.

The swing states also play a crucial role in the Electoral College system. These states receive heightened attention from presidential candidates due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes. As Bradford Plumer states, voters in these toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, respond to candidate messages effectively, and be more thoughtful in their decision-making process. Their swing votes essentially determine the outcome of the election. This focus encourages candidates to address the needs and concerns of swing states, ensuring that their interests are considered.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to give weight to large states in the political balance. Judge Posner highlights that the Electoral College offsets the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that large states have more influence in the presidential election. This is notable because presidential candidates prioritize campaigning in states with large populations, which would result in more attention being directed towards these states. The Electoral College thus maintains a level of equity among states, preventing smaller states from being overshadowed.

While the Electoral College holds various advantages, it is important to acknowledge the arguments in favor of an election by popular vote. Detractors often argue that the system is unfair to voters, as candidates tend to focus solely on the swing states. According to Bradford Plumer, this leads to presidential campaigns neglecting certain states, with Rhode Island and South Carolina being examples from the 2000 campaign. However, the Electoral College provides a slender advantage to less populous states and ensures that their voices are not drowned out by the larger states. Additionally, voters in non-swing states still possess the power to engage in the democratic process by expressing their political preferences.

In conclusion, there are valid arguments to both keep the Electoral College and change to an election by popular vote. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures every citizen feels represented, and gives weight to both swing states and large states. Nonetheless, it is essential to seek a balance that addresses the concerns of detractors, such as ensuring that candidates value the concerns of all states. As we consider the future of our democratic process, it is crucial to approach this issue with careful consideration and keep the best interests of our nation in mind.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your dedication to serving the people of our great state. I trust that you will consider all perspectives before making a decision on this important issue.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my position on the electoral process for electing the President of the United States. After careful consideration of the arguments and evidence, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. While there are valid concerns regarding the Electoral College system, I believe it provides several practical benefits that would be lost if we were to switch to a popular vote system.

One of the main reasons for keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, a dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Furthermore, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region, such as the South or the Northeast, has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates are incentivized to campaign nationwide and appeal to voters from different regions. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it prevents one region from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the so-called swing states. These states play a pivotal role in deciding the election and therefore receive the most attention from candidates. This type of targeted campaigning encourages voters in these states to be more engaged and informed, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the final outcome.

The Electoral College also provides a balance in representation between large and small states. As Bradford Plumer points out, large states like California, with a significant population, receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the greater number of electoral votes they possess. This ensures that candidates address the concerns and interests of both small and large states, thus maintaining a fair representation.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Run-off elections can be time-consuming and expensive, and the Electoral College system guarantees a clear winner in each election. This stability in the electoral process allows for a smooth transition of power and avoids further political divisions and disputes caused by inconclusive outcomes.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, I believe the practical benefits it offers outweigh the potential disadvantages. The Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses campaigning efforts on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages contribute to a fair and effective election process that upholds the principles of the Founding Fathers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope you will take my viewpoint into consideration when discussing any potential changes to the electoral process.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of whether the United States should keep the Electoral College or change to a system of election by popular vote for the president. After carefully considering the arguments from various sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the candidate who wins the electoral vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner is more likely to have a clear majority and a strong mandate to govern. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in close elections, and the potential for disputes and run-off elections, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. The Electoral College avoids such complications and ensures a clear winner.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election of the president. As Judge Posner argues, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents and takes into account the interests of all regions. This prevents one region from dominating the election and gives a voice to voters in states that might otherwise be overlooked.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This forces candidates to not only target densely populated areas but also reach out to voters in states where the outcome is not predetermined. This means that candidates are more likely to listen to the concerns and issues of voters in these states, making their campaigns more inclusive and representative. In a popular vote system, candidates would have little incentive to campaign in states they know they have no chance of winning, which could lead to certain states being ignored.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it balances the influence of large states with smaller ones. By awarding electoral votes based on representation in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that states with smaller populations still have a significant say in the election. This is important for maintaining a fair and equitable system where the voices and concerns of all citizens, regardless of their state's size, are taken into consideration. In a purely popular vote system, large states would have a disproportionately large influence, potentially marginalizing smaller states.

While critics argue that the winner-take-all system in the Electoral College leads to a lack of attention to non-swing states, it must be acknowledged that candidates cannot campaign in every state. The Electoral College forces candidates to strategically focus on states where they have the best chance of winning. This allows candidates to reach a larger number of voters overall and ensures that the interests of various regions are taken into account.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept because it provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal for candidates, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College strikes a balance between the preferences of the individual states and the need for a clear winner with broad support.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you carefully consider the benefits of keeping the Electoral College when making decisions regarding our electoral system.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world. The idea is being implemented in suburban areas as a part of the movement called ""smart planning."" There are several advantages to limiting car usage, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life for residents.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and the percentage is even higher in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, emissions can be significantly reduced, contributing to efforts to combat climate change.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. Cities like Paris have experienced high levels of smog due to car emissions, and partial driving bans have been enforced to tackle the issue. By restricting car usage, cities can decrease the amount of air pollution and ultimately create healthier environments for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the quality of life for residents. In car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without cars. The absence of cars allows for quieter and safer streets, where people can freely walk, cycle, and socialize with their neighbors. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages the use of public transportation, which can reduce traffic congestion and make commuting easier and more efficient.

Moreover, reducing car usage can lead to more compact and accessible suburban areas. In places like Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, encouraging residents to travel on foot for their daily needs. This approach not only supports local businesses but also reduces the need for vast parking spaces and sprawling shopping malls. By creating more pedestrian-friendly environments, communities can become more sustainable and enjoyable for residents.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance the quality of life for residents. By adopting smart planning techniques and promoting alternative modes of transportation, cities and suburbs can create more sustainable and livable environments for everyone. It is crucial for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace this concept and work towards a future with fewer cars on the road.",1
"The people of our great nation are told to vote on who they would like to lead and represent them. This is a Democracy and American citizens deserve this right. There have been incidents where the majority of the popular vote from U.S. citizens did not lead to the election of that candidate. This is because of the electoral college. This is the cause of citizens not having the president they asked for. Most American people do not agree with the electoral college. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses are wrong, Bradford Plumer.

The disaster factor is a what the electoral college should really be concerned about. The system allows for many slipups. ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses are wrong, Bradford Plumer. In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Also, electors who aren't loyal to the county have occasionally chosen to vote for the party that they'd want rather then vote for their party's candidate. Popular vote is what our founding fathers wanted in the beginning. They wanted equality between people, and the wanted the people to vote for who they wanted as a leader. With the electoral college, this vision cannot become reality.

The popular vote is what a Democracy is all about. ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachorism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense"" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to Keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President, Richard A. Posner. There is no point in having the people vote if they aren't voting for what they need as a nation. We have brought our nation together so that they can decide on someone to watch over them and protect them.

The Electoral college is non Democratic and needs to be abolishes as soon as possible. There is no more use for it, as the population continues to grow. The popular vote is the way our great leaders taught us how to vote.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College as a Vital Component of Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as an essential process for the election of the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that retaining the Electoral College is crucial for ensuring fairness, regional representation, and political stability in our presidential elections.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote, comprises 538 electors. These electors are crucial in the selection of the President and Vice President, as they represent their respective states' interests in the electoral process, offering a balanced approach to electing the President.

One of the significant advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of a disputed outcome. This ensures a smooth transition of power and prevents potentially chaotic situations that could arise if the popular vote were the sole determining factor.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters national representation and prevents regional dominance. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign in different states and appeal to a broader range of voters. With the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, candidates prioritize swing states, thereby engaging a more diverse electorate and preventing the disregard of certain regions' interests.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states, giving appropriate weight to each. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which benefits small states, is counterbalanced by the Electoral College. Presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to states of varying sizes, ensuring that voters from both small and large states receive due consideration during electoral campaigns. This balance of representation favors a more equitable and inclusive democracy.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This reduces the potential complications and expenses associated with run-off elections, thereby maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of the presidential election process.

It is important to remember that the Electoral College encourages voter participation, even for those residing in states that often lean heavily towards one party or another. Despite the perception that their votes may not have a significant impact on the national result, approximately half of the eligible American population still exercises their right to vote. Voters are driven by their desire to express their political preferences and contribute to the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a necessary process that upholds the principles of fairness, regional representation, and stability in presidential elections. It ensures certainty of outcome, guarantees national representation, promotes balance between big and small states, and avoids run-off elections. By preserving the Electoral College, we can uphold the values and traditions established by our founding fathers while ensuring a robust and inclusive democratic process.

I urge you to consider the merits of the Electoral College and advocate for its retention. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid concerns and criticisms of the Electoral College, I believe that it plays a crucial role in our democracy.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the election results are conclusive and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome. With the winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral-vote victory, making the process more predictable and stable.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure victory. This means that candidates have to consider the interests and concerns of voters from different regions of the country. This results in a president who is more likely to represent the diverse needs and perspectives of the entire nation. It also prevents the possibility of a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected, ensuring that the president is a unifying figure for all regions.

The winner-take-all method and focus on swing states also contribute to the strength of the Electoral College. Candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on toss-up states, prompting voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This system encourages thoughtful voting and makes it more likely that the most engaged and informed voters will decide the election, rather than a few swing voters in a direct popular vote.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it provides an opportunity for smaller states to have a say in the election. As Judge Posner rightly points out, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states, ensuring that presidential candidates give attention to citizens in states with smaller populations. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated states and neglecting the needs and concerns of citizens in smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections by invariably producing a clear winner. This eliminates the complications and uncertainty that can arise when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. The Electoral College guarantees a decisive outcome, preventing prolonged and potentially divisive run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, the high voter turnout in recent elections demonstrates that voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the outcome. The Electoral College does not diminish the significance of individual votes but rather ensures that each state's voice is heard in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a critical role in our democracy by providing certainty of outcome, encouraging trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, balancing the influence of large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. It ensures that the president represents the diverse needs and perspectives of the entire nation while preserving the stability and integrity of the election process. For these reasons, I strongly urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I appreciate your commitment to serving our state and country.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have long been a symbol of freedom and convenience, but recent trends suggest that limiting car usage may actually have several advantages. Whether it is through car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, or car-free days, there are various strategies being implemented around the world to reduce the reliance on cars. This shift is not only beneficial for the environment but also for the overall well-being of communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars contribute significantly to global warming. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number goes up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 2009). By reducing car usage, emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce air pollution in urban areas. In Paris, a partial driving ban was implemented during a period of intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion (Duffer, 2014). Cities like Bogota, Colombia, have also experimented with car-free days, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams and decreased smog levels (Selsky, 2002). By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, cities can improve traffic flow and create more livable spaces.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. Studies have shown that increased physical activity through modes of transportation such as biking or walking can lead to improvements in cardiovascular health and overall well-being (Rosenthal, 2013). Car-free neighborhoods, like Vauban in Germany, provide residents with the opportunity to walk or bike as the primary means of transportation, resulting in improved health outcomes and a stronger sense of community (Rosenthal, 2009).

Limiting car usage also promotes sustainable urban planning. By creating compact communities with accessible public transportation and less space for parking, cities can reduce urban sprawl and create more sustainable living environments. This approach has been adopted in places like Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street instead of distant malls (Rosenthal, 2009). By designing communities that prioritize people over cars, cities can create vibrant, walkable, and socially connected neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and promoting sustainable urban planning, the shift away from car dependence offers numerous benefits. By adopting strategies such as car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, and car-free days, societies can create more livable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly communities. It is clear that limiting car usage is no longer just a trend but a necessary step towards a more sustainable future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can offer numerous advantages to both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing the reliance on cars, not only can we improve the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we can also create more sustainable and livable communities. The passages provided highlight examples from various countries where limiting car usage has been implemented successfully.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, with some areas in the United States reporting emissions as high as 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can effectively decrease these emissions and mitigate climate change. In Paris, for example, a driving ban was enforced to combat high levels of pollution, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality (Robert Duffer).

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable and compact communities. The article mentions Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally not allowed. As a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars and 57 percent had sold their cars to move to this community. Residents report feeling less stressed and happier without the constant reliance on cars (Elisabeth Rosenthal). This approach is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, with the aim of making suburbs more accessible to public transportation and reducing the need for extensive parking spaces (Elisabeth Rosenthal).

Limiting car usage also promotes alternative transportation options and reduces traffic congestion. Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day, during which millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. The event not only reduced traffic jams, but also demonstrated the feasibility of promoting alternative transportation modes and reducing smog (Andrew Selsky). By providing infrastructure and incentives for walking, cycling, and using public transportation, cities can encourage people to choose these modes of transportation, resulting in less congested roads and more efficient transportation networks.

In addition to the aforementioned benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to improved public health. By reducing car dependence, people are more likely to engage in physical activity through walking or cycling, which in turn can lead to improved cardiovascular health and lower rates of obesity. Furthermore, the decrease in air pollution from fewer cars on the road can contribute to better respiratory health for individuals living in car-restricted areas.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society. It can help combat climate change, create more sustainable communities, reduce traffic congestion, and improve public health. These benefits have already been observed in various countries where such measures have been implemented successfully. By prioritizing alternative transportation modes and creating spaces that are less reliant on cars, we can create a more environmentally-friendly and livable future.",1
"Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote. Source B also in paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million. That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70. That is a tremendous difference in population. Don't let our country plummet into bad election. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote. With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right. Source C says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the ""swing"" states."" Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000. Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads. Just as Source D states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people. What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress? It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" What if it happened again? Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush? Thank that to the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. But why?

First of all, Source E states, ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does."" But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair. The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do. This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play. It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California. Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, ""They are the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" Once again, this statement is unfair. This is favoritism. This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more ""thoughtful"". Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.

People want to make their own decisions. It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important. With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote. So it's official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason. It's fair. There's only one thing I have to say to you. State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.",0
"Over the course of years new technologies have been invented to better our life style. there have been inventions like trains,airplanes and boats to better our transportion however there is one transportion vehicle that has spun up many controversies. The automobile or ""car"" as most people call it has spanwed more harm than good rates of pollution have risen and smog can be found almost anywhere. Limiting the usage of cars should a solution due to the advantage of reduced pollution, less green house gas and it could even make a person happier!

As most industrial inventions cars do produce tons of smog due to Diesel fuel a chemical found in cars. Smog has been such a issue that the city of paris actully had to enforce a law that would ban cars for a few days. This law was so stressed that any one caught driving would bee fined 22 euros in which converted in dollars would add up to 31 dollars. Paris had more smog than any other european capital they had about 147 micrograms compared to London on the other hand which only had 79.7. With such high numbers of micrograms the intensity of the smog worsend causing the extreme idea of banning cars. This example should be a reason on why we should reduce the usage of automobiles so that extreme measures are not acted on but more importantly the possibility of having pure of cleansed oxygen.

In alliance of having minimum pollution safety is also one advantage that reducing driving may enhance according too Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company stated that the plan of reducing usage of cars did bring a safer world for pedestrians not only does is bring about safety but it does conserve natural resources like oil that may take hundreds of years to replenish. We need to keep in mine that as inhabitants of earth we must care and value every natural resource. We only have one planet and we must protect it. Reducing driving has been such a triumph that a mother of two even said ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" once again this statement only poves that reducing the usage of automobiles is a better life style for all.

All in all reducing driving does bring some great advantages and should really be consider as a plan to make the world a better place. this plan should be acted upon all over the world.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While it is true that the Electoral College has faced widespread criticism and calls for its abolition, there are several reasons why I believe it is crucial to maintain this system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes allows for a clear winner to emerge, even if their popular vote share is slight. This certainty plays a vital role in maintaining stability and avoiding disputes over the outcome of the election. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to closer margins and potentially contested results, as seen in the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that the president has trans-regional appeal. A presidential candidate must have support across different regions to secure the required number of electoral votes. This prevents a candidate with merely regional appeal from being elected. By requiring candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions and does not favor a specific part of the country.

The focus on swing states during campaigns is another significant advantage of the Electoral College. With a winner-take-all method, candidates concentrate their efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, leading to a more engaged and informed electorate. In contrast, a direct popular vote campaign would limit candidates' attention to densely populated urban areas or specific demographics, leaving other regions and their voters feeling disenfranchised.

The Electoral College also restores balance to the political influence of large states. By taking into account both population and state representation in the Senate, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a say in the presidential election. This prevents larger states from dominating the political landscape and ensures that candidates address the concerns and issues of citizens living in less populous areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate secures a majority, a run-off election could complicate the process and potentially delay the selection of a president. The Electoral College, by design, guarantees a clear winner and avoids the need for further voting.

While critics argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their chosen candidate has little chance of winning, the data shows that voter turnout remains high in presidential elections. Voters participate to express their political preferences, rather than with the expectation that their vote will decide the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system that should be retained. It provides certainty, ensures the election of a president with broad regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. While there may be room for reforms that address some of the criticism, it is essential to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the Electoral College.

I urge you to consider these points when discussing the issue of the Electoral College and make decisions that best serve the interests of our democracy and the American people.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"For many years people have been using cars to get around to do their important tasks. The stress every individual has to go through just to make it through the day could be difficult. It is better if we create a car free world. Just picture you waking up in the morning peacefully without the sounds of car motors turning on or the smell of smoke in the air. With the reduction of cars, the planet would be a healthier and safer place to live on.

Limiting car usage can have a numerous amount of advantages to citizens. With all the issues every country has, the most important one is the emission of green house gases. With the use of less cars, the green house gas percentage rate will go down significantly. In source 3 it says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As this event starts to happen the Earths atmosphere will start to recover and there would be less traffic on the roads. In source 3, Bogota Colombia has a program named the ""Day Without Cars."" This program has a goal to promote another way of transportation to the people and to reduce smog in their capital city. While it on their third year, ""people are generating a revolutionary change..."" said Enrique rivera. Since this event is becoming more successful parks and sports centers have been used more throughout the city. In source 2, Pari has a situation of smog too. They decided to created a ""partial driving ban"" which allowed the air to be cleared in Paris but also fined 4,000 drivers with the cost of 22euros 31 or impounded cars for their ""reaction of the fine."" Another advantage citizens have to limiting car usage is that it lowers the cost of individual of paying their car bills and the amount of gas which is really high. With other types transportation like public buses, walking or riding a bicycle this effort helps to conserve resources that are about to disappear since we use them too much and it improves our safety with the reduction of having car accidents due to traffic jams. In source 1 Vauban, Germany their is a community that has 5,500 resident that do not own a car. This community restricts car into their streets. This community is a ""lowcar suburban life"" that has a wallkway,stores on the main street and some distant highways with the help of public transportation.

As we continue our effort into establishing a ""car free"" community it will benefit us in the future. While we reduced the percentage of green house gases in the air then the government will not have to worry about one problem and move to something that needs to be fixed right away. All the taxes we've have beeen paying will to crisis outside of our country. If we expand these no car communties that Colombia and Germany have then there will be a ""shift in American behavior"" source 4 states. Americans love cars but as the years passed by from ""20052013 the miles driven per persons have slowly decereased 9 percent."" Hopefully,as the next few year it will make a difference.

Even though us humans love cars their is a limit into how much we should use them. But as we grow we will have a healthier and dafer planet to live on, spend less moeny on cars and more money on important nessesites, and it woyukd create a better future for our children an their families.",0

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and the method by which the President of the United States is elected. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote.

One of the key reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the outcome of the election is clear and reduces the likelihood of disputes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to closer margins and potential disputes over results, as evident in the 2000 election.

Another important consideration is that the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. Judge Posner highlights that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the election and potentially neglecting the interests of other regions. In this way, the Electoral College promotes a more unified and balanced representation.

Additionally, the focus on swing states in the electoral system encourages candidates to campaign and connect with voters across the country. As mentioned by Judge Posner, candidates direct their efforts towards toss-up states, where voters are more attentive and engaged in the political process. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who closely consider the candidates' messages, have a significant impact on the election outcome. It encourages candidates to address issues that are relevant to a wide range of voters, rather than solely appealing to the interests of densely populated areas.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a system that proportionately recognizes the influence of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large states, as they receive more attention from candidates due to their larger number of electoral votes. This prevents a situation where candidates solely focus on the needs of highly-populated areas, thus allowing for a more diverse representation of interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time and resources by providing a clear winner and preventing the possibility of extended election cycles. The integrity of the election process is maintained, and the transition of power is smoother and more efficient.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained due to its ability to provide a clear outcome, promote trans-regional representation, encourage candidate engagement across all states, proportionately recognize the importance of large and small states, and prevent run-off elections. While the popular vote may seem appealing, it is important to consider the practical benefits and safeguards that the Electoral College offers.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to carefully consider the advantages outlined above when evaluating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

Sincerely,

"Cars have been a huge advancement in technology in the past 100 years. Although they make traveling much easier, cars are a big reason for economical displeasure. Limiting car usage can help us in many ways. It will reduce pollution, more building space, and death rates will decrease.

Initially, limited car usage can play a major factor in pollution for the world. In ""Paris Bans driving due to smog,"" it says that 147 micrograms of particulated matter was fount in London. This is causing sickness and illness in lot of countries. If we would reduce car usage there would be lot less smog and greenhouse gases in the air that we breathe every day. Who wants to live in a cloud of dust?

More so, cars are contesting the roads and towns of almost every city. In France they had a day where they didnt allow you to drive your vehicle a certain day, and the congestion rate was down 60%. With less vehicles on the road, it gives more space for buildings to be built. Parks and sport centers will be built, giving more kids the chance to grown up being healthy and fit. As you can see limiting car usage can help in more ways than you thought. Also the less cars being bought and made, the more money we can have to better the lives of the sick and poor in the world. to use the money for events in the world swell. The jobs that would become available to people for building more bicycles and sidewalks would increase tremendously.

Therefore, the limitation of car usage will drastically change the rate of death in America and throughout the world. A study shows that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. If there are less people on the road then there will be less devastating fatalitieson the road. The road is a path to your next door, not soppose to be the last path that you take. I dont want to be remembered as a statistic in this world, so less people driving and more people living is a great thing. Maybe we can see more good news than bad news whenever we turn the television on on sunday mornings after all.

In conclusion, The reduced limitation on car usage in the world can drastically improve our pollution problem, help with more buildings, and the death rate. Now let me ask you, if you had to choose wheither to drive that Mustang or to walk. After reading this passage, which would you choose? Like i said, i dont want to be remembered as a statistic.",0
"Dear Florida State Senator, It has been brought to my attention as to which method of voting shall be used in future elections. As of now we use the Electoral college method, but looking back through previous years there is evidence this method has caused some dispute. Due to these problems I suggest using the popular voting method. The popular voting method is not only a direct vote for the desired candidate of the people's choice, but this method is also less complicated, leaving less room for many problems.

Initially the Electoral College voting method sounded like a great idea but over recent study some people are beginning to become more fond of the popular voting method. The popular voting method is directly controlled by the people and their vote is sent directly to their desired candidate. On the other side, by using the electoral college method voters vote for a select member of the state's electoral college votes and that member is eligible to vote for any presidential candidate of their choice. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, "" when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors."" Further evidence from this article quote on quote claims there is a "" lack of democratic pedigree."" Electoral voting also only benefits the larger states because of there is a larger amount of members of the electoral college for the larger states. Popular voting provides a more direct way for votes from the people to reach their desired candidate as opposed to someone who may not vote for a candidate of their choice.

In addition to many down sides of the electoral college voting method, there have been incidents in the past while using this method of voting. For example, evidence in the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, in 1960 there was an indicident pertaining to the election of John F. Kennedy. In his case, segregationists from Louisiana were planning to and just about succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with electors to whom opposed JFK. This article also brings up another problem with the electoral college votes in the year of 2000 listing it as the ""2000 fiasco"" and ""biggest crisis of the century."" While the electoral college holds many faults I'm sure in the past there have also been popups of downsides to the popular voting method also. Through reading a select amount of articles I have picked up more recent and destructive faults within the electoral college voting method.

In conclusion, the popular voting method should be applied as the designated process of electing the United States President because it guarantees a direct vote towards a desired candidate of your choice. As our country is listed as a democracy, the votes towards the President should lie in the hands of the people. The electoral college is prone to many more problems and is a more complex method of voting. With votes in the hands of the people, voters can get a full "" hands on"" voting experience. As to not repeat myself, in this way voters can really understand the voting system and get the idea in their head their vote is going towards their chosen candidate. Popular voting has not only been proven to be the more preferred method of voting, but in my opinion, shall be the established method of voting to use in the future elections.",0
"Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to society. This shift in behavior can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation methods, and improve the overall quality of life in communities.

One of the most significant benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to combating climate change. This is especially crucial considering President Obama's ambitious goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

Additionally, limiting car usage can promote alternative transportation methods and improve public transportation systems. The passage set mentions various examples of communities and cities that have implemented car-free or car-reduced initiatives. In Vauban, Germany, for example, street parking and home garages are generally forbidden, and car ownership is limited to designated areas. As a result, the community has seen an increase in public transportation usage and a decrease in car ownership. Similar initiatives have been adopted in other cities, such as the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. These examples demonstrate that limiting car usage can encourage people to utilize other modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or using public transportation, which can lead to reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on the overall quality of life in communities. The passage set highlights the experiences of residents in Vauban, Germany, and their satisfaction with giving up their cars. Many residents reported feeling happier and less stressed without a car. By reducing car usage, individuals can enjoy cleaner and quieter streets, increased opportunities for walking and biking, and a stronger sense of community. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the revitalization of city centers and the development of compact, accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers significant advantages for individuals and society as a whole. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative transportation methods, and improving the overall quality of life in communities, we can create a more sustainable and livable world. It is essential for individuals, communities, and policymakers to embrace these ideas and work towards a future with reduced dependence on cars.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner. Based on the evidence presented, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical method for electing the President of the United States. The founding fathers established it as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. The process of selecting electors, the meeting of these electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress ensure a fair and constitutionally sound election process. The Electoral College has been successfully used for centuries and changing it would require significant modifications to the Constitution.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system in most states means that the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the President. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote and ensures a clear outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, a dispute over the popular vote is more probable than a dispute over the Electoral College vote. Therefore, maintaining the Electoral College ensures a more stable and predictable election process.

In addition, the Electoral College promotes representation of all regions in the United States. It requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning specific regions and encourages them to campaign across the entire country. It ensures that the interests and concerns of all regions are taken into account in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states. This system incentivizes candidates to dedicate more attention and resources to states where the election outcome is uncertain. As a result, voters in these swing states are more likely to be engaged and informed about the candidates' positions and policies. Their thoughtful votes should have a significant influence in deciding the election, and the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the power among small and large states. The system helps to restore some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Judge Posner explains, the Electoral College allows large states to receive more attention from presidential candidates compared to small states. This ensures that candidates must consider the needs and interests of diverse states, promoting a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and effective.

While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, such as greater fairness to voters and increased attention to all states, the existing system of the Electoral College has proven to be functional, practical, and has multiple advantages that outweigh these potential benefits.

In conclusion, it is important to maintain the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its practicality, certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power among states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a valuable and effective system. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating any potential changes to the electoral process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our nation and its citizens.

Subject: The Value and Necessity of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to urge you to continue to uphold its importance in our presidential elections. While some argue for a shift towards a direct national popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic process for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty in election outcomes, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" Because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their popular vote percentage, disputes over the outcome are less likely compared to a popular vote system. This stability is essential in maintaining public trust in the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that every region of our diverse nation has a voice in the presidential election. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to singlehandedly elect a president. This requirement for trans-regional appeal encourages candidates to campaign and address a wide array of regional concerns, rather than focusing solely on the needs of highly populated areas. It fosters a sense of inclusivity and prevents regional favoritism.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its promotion of swing states. In swing states, which offer a more balanced distribution of voters, candidates are compelled to focus their campaign efforts to win over these crucial swing voters. This practice benefits all voters, as those in swing states tend to be more engaged, informed, and thoughtful in their decision-making. By empowering these voters, we ensure that the most considered individuals have a say in electing our president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College safeguards the influence of larger states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can lose some political weight. However, the Electoral College rectifies this issue by giving more attention to states with larger populations. As Judge Posner highlights, a narrow victory in a large state like Florida results in a significant number of electoral votes, whereas a similar margin in a smaller state like Wyoming would yield fewer electoral votes. This balances the influence of big and small states, ensuring a fair distribution of power.

Lastly, the Electoral College offers a solution to potential run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, which could complicate the presidential election process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. It streamlines the election process and avoids the need for time-consuming and costly run-offs.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely contingent on the possibility of influencing the outcome. As evidenced by the high turnout in the 2012 election, citizens engage in the electoral process to express their political preferences and be part of shaping our democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a cornerstone of our democratic system. It ensures certainty in election results, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to cater to swing states, balances the influence of larger and smaller states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I urge you to defend the Electoral College and reject any efforts to replace it with a direct national popular vote.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in your commitment to safeguarding our democratic institutions and upholding the principles upon which our nation was founded. If you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

"Cars come in different colors, and are what we use to transport anything. Whether it a family going on vacation, going to work or going to school. With all of these possible benefits and more is what we gain from cars. We don't realize how cars really have an effect in our everyday changing world. That the moment we put the car key in to turn on the car we are creating are more hazardous world for the present time and the future to come. By,limiting car usage in the world we can do many positive and beneficial things like in our atmosphere, becoming a independent person without the need of a car, and to be relive as oneself.

To begin with, pollution can be reduced like never ever before in are world named history. Pollution now in days is just terrible to have. It not just make it difficult for us to breathe but, as well it destroy the atmosphere that we need protect us from the harmful rays of the sun. The greenhouse effect can be lowered if we limit the use of cars. This can be actually proven with the following exert of the passage,"" And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Source 1 The point that I'm really trying to convey, is that we can do this all together if we limit the car usage. There should be a well and profounded effort to do so. Another example would be that if we dont limit the usage of cars we can not have a fresh and clear atmosphere. Can you imagine a day that you wake up to find, that all that was around you be nothing but a smog and prevent you to see and do anything? The car we have produce dangerous toxic that can up in are air and can be very hard for us later on. But if limit car usage, we can prevent this from happening. Not, just us but to other place in the world. This was what happen in France ,to prevent the usage for cars producing that smog they created an renforce day to prevent the use of car. Which lead to a shocking over turn of news. Like so in the following,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" Source 2 What I'm trying to inform once again is that we limit we can create a better fit living world to be in. This is one advantages that we can do as fellow citizens in our country Which lead to me to my othe point, there is more that we have in advantage of limiting the usage of cars. It is a way of ""smart planing"" ourself as a community. We can live a more free caring world without the need of a car. Technology can play a part in the limit of of car usage. As stated in the folllowing ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Source 4See this occur and happen this a will fitted advantage to us all. Another, advantage that we have in hand is the ability to relieve our stress level to a much stable level. which lead to me to my other insight of information, ""When I had a car I was alwaystense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter"" Source 1 Being in the car makes it complicated and diifficult. This is another way for us take advantage to limit the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantegous for that we can benifit from that if we limit the use of care by lower pollution in are atmospher, creating a more benficial way for ouself without the need of a car, the relive of oneself.",0
"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions Rosenthal 34. Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizarre due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. genetically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.Rosenthal 6"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States Rosenthal 5"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied carfree day in Bogota, and he stated ""rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic28"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress...Selsky 24"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris Duffer 14. Heidrun Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health Rosenthal 43. You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options and you have the opportunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.",0
"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughout the years, different countries have encouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their ""goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to ""clear the air of the global city."" This is due to ""days of nearrecord pollution."" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage girl in front of you isn't paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressful days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.",0
"The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. From there, it steadily dropped to, as of April 2013, nine percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This decrease has had positive effects, though. Limiting car usage saves time, improves safety, conserves resources, and causes more social interactions with people.

Recent studies suggest the Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Still, in places like paris, cars are still causing pollution. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. Because of this ban, congestion went dow 60 percent in the capital of France. By having fewer cars out on the streets, it lowers rates of traffic and the time it takes people to get to work. Also, in result of a decrease in traffic, there would be less accidents and less lives lost to motorvehicle collisions.

France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel over gasoline results in higher percent of people using diesel vehicles. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. By cutting back on car usage, the world would save an astronomical amount of resources. If people stopped buying cars, there would be less production of them. Thus conserving the metal, as well as other materials, used to make the cars.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdent streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Sitting in a car to get to work, or any where in fact, restricts how much interaction you have with other people. By walking, or even taking public transportation, you get the chance to run into people you know or meet new people.

Time saving, improvement on safety, conservation of resources, and more social facetoface interactions can be accomplished by limting car usage. The decrease in the percentage of miles driven in the United States from 2005 to 2013 proves that people are starting to understand this. If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment as well.",0
"Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport bike riding, bus outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.

Now more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", source two, where the government took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.

Paris, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate mattercubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an improvement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.

With all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the ""Day Without Cars event""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3. In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.

One could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then The End of Car Culture, Source 4. People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding bicycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.

So with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There""s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This strategy has been implemented in various places around the world, and the results have been promising. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience benefits such as reduced pollution, improved health and safety, and enhanced community cohesion and accessibility.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a substantial portion of these emissions, which contribute to climate change. For instance, in Europe, passenger cars alone contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, a significant decrease in emissions can be achieved.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality by reducing pollution. In cities like Paris, where smog levels reach alarming levels, driving bans have been implemented to clear the air (Duffer, 2014). These measures have resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and pollution, providing citizens with cleaner and healthier environments to live in. Similarly, car-free days implemented in Bogota have shown how reducing car usage can improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion (Selsky, 2002).

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on public health and safety. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transit, individuals can increase physical activity levels, leading to better overall health. Moreover, with fewer cars on the roads, the risk of accidents and injuries decreases, making communities safer for pedestrians and cyclists.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the enhancement of community cohesion and accessibility. Suburban areas that are designed with a car-first mentality often lack the amenities and services that are easily accessible by foot or public transportation. By implementing smart planning strategies that prioritize compact and walkable communities, like Vauban in Germany, residents have access to shops and services that are within walking distance (Rosenthal, 2009). This fosters a sense of community and reduces the need for long-distance commutes, which can be time-consuming and costly.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting public health and safety and enhancing community cohesion, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on individuals, communities, and the environment. Cities, suburbs, and countries around the world have already started implementing strategies to limit car usage, and these efforts should be encouraged and expanded to create more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many societies. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated in various examples from around the world. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can achieve a multitude of benefits, including reduced emissions, increased accessibility, and improved physical and mental well-being.

Body:

Paragraph 1:

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, an experimental car-free community, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold a car to move there. As a result, Vauban's residents experience reduced carbon emissions, with cars being responsible for only 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This example highlights the potential impact of limiting car usage on reducing environmental harm.

Paragraph 2:

Beyond environmental advantages, limiting car usage can improve accessibility to services and amenities. Smart planning, which focuses on compact communities with accessible public transportation, makes daily tasks more convenient. Instead of relying on cars, stores are located within walking distance on main streets, reducing the need for long-distance travel. This approach has been adopted in many places, including suburbs in the United States. By making suburbs more compact and accessible, the dependency on cars decreases, improving the overall quality of life for residents.

Paragraph 3:

Additionally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being. Car-free communities, such as Vauban, create environments conducive to walking, cycling, and other physical activities. These means of transportation not only contribute to a healthier lifestyle but also reduce air pollution and noise pollution. Studies have shown that increased physical activity and reduced exposure to pollutants have significant health benefits, resulting in lower rates of obesity, respiratory diseases, and stress-related disorders.

Paragraph 4:

The success of limiting car usage is not limited to specific regions. Examples from around the world demonstrate the potential for positive change. For instance, a car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event introduced millions of Colombians to alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and taking public buses. The overwhelming participation in the event highlights the willingness of people to embrace change and prioritize sustainability.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage brings numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve accessibility, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The examples mentioned in this essay demonstrate the success and potential of limiting car usage, urging societies to reconsider their dependence on cars and embrace a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. It is essential for citizens and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards making our communities more sustainable and livable for future generations.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my support for the current Electoral College system used in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue that it is an outdated and undemocratic method, I believe that it serves important purposes and provides several advantages that outweigh the disadvantages.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner of the presidency is more likely to have a clear majority of electoral votes, reducing the chance of disputes over the outcome. In a country as diverse as ours, it is essential to have a system that provides a clear winner and avoids prolonged legal battles, as witnessed in the 2000 election.

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures the election of a president with trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner states, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This forces candidates to campaign in various states across the country, rather than focusing solely on heavily populated areas or regions where they have the most support. This requirement promotes a president who represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just one particular region.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article, are often the ones where the outcome is uncertain and could go either way. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and the issues at hand because they know their votes will have a significant impact on the election. This results in a more engaged electorate and a better-informed decision-making process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance and prevents the dominance of large states. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate and the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes help ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns of both small and large states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on the interests of heavily populated areas, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the needs of voters across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complexity of run-off elections. Instead of potentially having multiple rounds of voting to determine a winner, the Electoral College always produces a clear victor. This simplifies the election process and ensures that the country can move forward swiftly, without any uncertainty or prolonged periods of political instability.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who live in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election. This shows that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if the outcome may not swing an election.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College provides necessary checks and balances in our presidential election process and ensures that the president represents the diverse interests of the entire nation. It guarantees a clear winner, encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, gives voice to both small and large states, and streamlines the election process. While the system is not perfect, it has proven effective over the years and should be retained.

Thank you for considering my stance on this matter. I urge you to support the Electoral College system and continue to make decisions in the best interests of our nation.

Sincerely,

Subject: Support for the Electoral College to Ensure Fair Representation

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system, which I believe is crucial to the fair and balanced representation of the American people in the presidential election. While some argue in favor of changing to an election by popular vote, I firmly believe that maintaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our nation. In support of my claim, I will address the counterclaims and provide evidence from multiple sources to outline the benefits of this system.

One of the significant advantages of the Electoral College is ensuring the certainty of outcomes. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote almost always surpasses their share of the popular vote. Additionally, we must acknowledge that almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, which further solidifies the legitimacy and clarity of the Electoral College system.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the concept of a president who represents the entire nation. Unlike a popular vote, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, preventing the dominance of any particular region in electing the president. This system ensures that candidates campaign across the country, listening to the concerns and interests of voters from all regions. Judge Posner rightly points out that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The Electoral College fosters a sense of inclusivity and representation for all Americans.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives voice and importance to swing states. As Judge Posner explains, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes drives candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, carefully considering the competing candidates' policies and visions. This is crucial in maintaining an informed and engaged electorate, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters play a decisive role in determining the election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states. In our Constitution, large states already experience a loss of proportional representation due to the apportionment of the Senate. Judge Posner rightly argues that the Electoral College system restores some weight to the political balance by providing greater attention to large states during the campaigns. This preserves a sense of fairness and equity among the states, preventing the dominance of one group of states over the others.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections that can prolong and complicate the presidential election process. By producing a clear winner, the Electoral College avoids situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, as seen in the Nixon and Clinton elections mentioned by Judge Posner. This simplifies the election process and prevents unnecessary strain on the American people.

While some critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters from states where their vote may not affect the outcome, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express their political preferences. They are not solely motivated by the belief that their single vote may decide the election. In 2012, approximately half of the eligible American population voted, indicating a significant level of political engagement in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a crucial role in ensuring fair representation in the presidential election. It offers certainty of outcomes, promotes a president who represents the entire nation, gives significance to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is important to consider these practical reasons when discussing the future of the Electoral College.

I urge you to consider the benefits outlined above and support the continuation of the Electoral College system. Maintaining this system will help uphold the principles of fairness, inclusivity, and balanced representation in our democratic process.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your support on this matter.

Sincerely,

"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to both individuals and society as a whole. The following points outline the benefits of reducing car dependency based on information provided in the passage set.

One significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing measures to reduce car usage, such as promoting alternative modes of transportation and making suburbs more accessible to public transportation, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how car emissions contribute to poor air quality, often reaching dangerous levels in cities. By reducing car usage, we can alleviate smog and create cleaner and healthier environments for citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is reduced traffic congestion. In the passage about Bogota's car-free day, it is mentioned that millions of Colombians participated in the event, leaving the streets without traffic jams. This demonstrates that alternative transportation methods, such as biking, walking, or using public transport, can alleviate congestion and make commuting more efficient.

Limiting car usage also promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle. When cars are less accessible or used less frequently, individuals are more likely to engage in activities such as walking, biking, or skating. This promotes exercise and can lead to improved overall health and well-being.

Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to cost savings for individuals. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban mentions that 70 percent of families in the community do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This indicates that people can save money by not owning cars, as they do not have to bear the costs of purchasing, maintaining, and fueling vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage brings several advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, alleviate traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and result in cost savings. By adopting smart planning strategies and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable communities for both present and future generations.",1
"Being a person of politics yourself, you of all people should know that many compromises have been made over the course of the establishment of the United States. However, some of the compromises, like the electoral college, were made because of factors in the past and are now not needed in today's modern democracy. While the electoral college once worked as a compromise in the past, it is an archaic system that unfairly represents the votes of citizens all across the nation. A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions.

In implementing the electoral college, most states' votes either go to one candidate or the other, leading to candidates to only campaign in swing states Bradford Plumer 13. This may not seem like much of a problem, but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous. Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics.

With the Electoral College, there is also the risk that electors may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president. In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" Bradford 10. These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president.

In addition, a tie is likely in an electoral vote because of swing states, which has the potential to lead to a disaster. If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives Plumer 12. The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio.

Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision Richard A. Posner 20. However, this is not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of other welleducated voters in other states who have opinions that will never be counted because of the electoral college. If the popular vote becomes the new method in choosing the president, voters all across the nation will pay more attention to elections because they feel that their vote can make a difference, and it will. This will in turn increase the number of voters actively paying attention to their country's decisions. Because of the Electoral College, ""about onehalf the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election"" Posner 23. Although this number is mentioned as a success in Posner's arguement, this means that there is onehalf of American voices left unheard. Democracy only works if all citizens vote, but they will only take the time to vote if they know that they can make a difference.

Change needs to happen and it has to soon. If not, a poor president could be elected and then who knows what bad things could happen? With the popular vote, more people will be heard, and they will better take part in their country's government, leading to a better nation.",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options, such as public transportation and cycling. Finally, reducing car dependence can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. These advantages make it clear that limiting car usage is a positive step towards a more sustainable and livable future.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. The passage set states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make progress towards achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The passage set mentions that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options. The passage set describes an experimental community in Germany called Vauban, where car ownership is limited and public transportation and cycling are prioritized. Similarly, the passage set mentions a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, which aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By investing in public transportation infrastructure and prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transit, we can create more accessible and sustainable cities that are less dependent on cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. The passage set mentions that some residents of Vauban, Germany, feel happier and less stressed without cars. By reducing car usage, people are encouraged to walk or cycle more, leading to increased physical activity and improved health. Additionally, by investing in walkable neighborhoods and improving pedestrian infrastructure, we can create environments that are conducive to active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, promote sustainable transportation options, and encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. By prioritizing alternatives to cars and investing in sustainable transportation infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly cities. The benefits of limiting car usage make it clear that it is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and prosperous future.",1
"  A Blueprint for Sustainable Urban Futures  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban life. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making room for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the primary benefits of car-free cities lies in their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"The elector college is a controversial subject today in america, based on many questionable policies that leave many americans confused and cheated. This is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states.

With the electoral college way of electing a president voters arent actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors who will then vote for the candidate. There are so many things that can go wrong when electing like this. Voters can't necessarily control who their electors vote for, you may vote for a certain slate of electors but they may still go ahead and vote for someone else. Sometimes voters get confused and may vote for a slate of electors who are for the wrong candidate. For example, in 1960 segragationists in the Louisiana Legislature almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually go to him. Although these things dont happen all time their is always the possibility and why take that chance on such an important event, choosing our president the person who will lead our country.

In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winnertakeall basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. Why not just cut out all of the extra processes and focuses on the decision of the people directly.

Although there are many arguments against the electoral college there still are people who argue in favor of it. There is a certainty of outcome with this process. There will less likely be a run off election with this process. All in all the major arguments against this process outweigh the pros of it, which are few.

With all of the reasons to go against this process I think it is necessary to change the election to popular vote for the president. We need to give the voice directly back to the people of our country so we know that we really do choose our fate in these elections.",0
"The age of cars has come to a grinding stop. Atleast, That's what the general consensus of these 4 articles seems to be. Although current youth do not see car buying as a major thing in their lives right now, it is highly unlikely it will remain as such because of the structure of an average american lifestyle.

Cars are a massive staple of the world and hold many things together and allow for fast, easy, convenient travel. The young people of today do not currently have to use cars to get where they are going because of many factors such as friends with cars, human powered forms of transportation such as bicycles, skateboards, etc.and pareits with cars. Once these children move away from home to a college or to a job elsewhere they will need a car to maintain a normal lifestyle. We are currently in a second babyboom, this means that there are many young people that do not need cars and thus do not have one, swaying the data away from the ""car culture"". While it is true that some people are trying to reduce their ""carbon footprint"" by driving less and using public transportation, the number of them is very small and irrelevant when compared to all people in the world. Cars maintain a large amount of appeal that cannot be found in any other form of transportation: This appeal is that it is your vehicle, to do whatever you want with and be free, it is also easy and convenient to get from place to place, it is a place to hang out with your friends andor a significant other, it is also faster than any other form of transportation short of a helicopter or plane. Cars have so many benefits that people will not just quit driving because of increased carbon emissions, most of which is not entirely the fault of cars.

While cars do put out a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, that amount is inconsequential compared to the massive amou its of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanos and by other human creations. One volcanic eruption emits around the same amount of carbon dioxide in a few hours as the entire country of America does in 1015 years. Cars are not the true issue here, the main reason carbon dioxide is on tthe rise is because of the lack of trees and worldwide deforestation. All plant life can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, this means that more plant life equals less carbon dioxide. Instead of trying to reduce the number of cars in the world and make life harder on many people, the focus of the world should be to increase the amount of vegetation in the world so as to counterbalance the number of cars in the world.

Cars have long been an important factor in the world social, political, and economical structure. Before the second World War, Fuhrer Adolf Hitler decided that his people needed a cheap, basic car so as to increase Germany's economic prowess. Due to this vision Volkswagen, The people's car, was started. Volkswagen marked the start of cheap, affordable cars for everyday people. Although Germany lost World War II, their technology and ideas diffused to much of the world thanks to American and Soviet research. Their idea of a people's car spread around the world and the 1950's marked the start of massive sprawling suburbs that relied on personal vehicles to get to and from work, the store, school, or anywhere outside of the suburbs. This was a totally new type of lifestyle It wasn't urban life where you could walk or ride a bus wherever you needed, and it wasn't rural where you made everything by hand and didnt travel often. No, this was something entirely new that was brought about because of the advent of cheap affordable personal transportation. Now everyone can get to work relying on only themselves and not bus drivers or train operators, people have a new sense of freedom afforded them by this magnificent new machine, the car.

The same ideas and principles that made cars such an important part of culture and life in the 1950's still remain in our lives today. Cars will remain an important part of world culture until another form of transportation is easier, more convenient, andor cheaper. A car gives its driver a fast, freeing, and flexible form of transportation unparalleled by anything today. Car use should not be limited, it should be encouraged.",0
"The Electoral College has been here for many years. Over the aast years many aeoale think it is unfair to the voters. There are many conflicts that have risen about it. Without a doubt , the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because they voters are basically voting for no reason.

The electors that are chosen have only a little amount of oainions. If the voters would be included there would be a variety of choices of who should win. Every american should be comfortable and certain about who they voted for and if the Electoral College votes contradicts that there can be aroblems.

Furthermore , In a direct election everyone is treated equally. Unlike , the voting we have now , ""If you lived in Texas , for instance , and wanted to vote for John Kerry , you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors aledged to Kerry"". source 2, a. 10. Voters cant always control whom their electors vote for but voters sometimes can get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Why have so much going on when you can aeacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together?. Yes , they may be the electors and might have more knowledge of whats going on but they are just aeoale too and everyone is created equally so definitely their votes shouldnt be the only ones actually counted.

Moreover , Bigger states may have a bigger effect on the votes because of their large amount of aeoale voting. By , not making their vote count some aeoale can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting haaaens for a reason if gives the world a chance to aick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right aerson but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their aower and freedom to saeak. "" Voters in aresidential elections ae aeoale who want to exaress a aolitical arefeence rather than aeoale ho think that a single vote may decide an election"".source 3 , a.23. The Electoral College may have worked in the aast but now its not working as well.

To conclude , The Electoral College arocess should be stoaaed for numerous number of reasons. It limits aeoales oainions and aeoale are voting for no reason if they cant aick who they want. Whoever is running for aresident and everyone who votes for one aerson shouldnt just be heard from a certai groua of aeoale. Everyones oainion should matter.",0
"The presidential Elections.

The elections are a brutal time candidates compete for the favor of the citizens they campaign, give great speeches about why they would be best for the position of leading the nation, often state why their adversary would be the worst person for the job. This causes opposition in the nation tearing it apart, however now not only are the people emotional about the election but also about the process, their are aguments about whether or not that the original process would remain. The system that the elections have been held since the Constitution has been written was that each citizen in a state would vote for one candidate or the other by voting for the electors of that specific person then the electors in turn would vote for the candidate and their votes would decide the presidency as stated in paragraph six and seven of the first source"" What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register. This system although it has worked so far it is not the best way of conducting the elections in this time and age citizens should modify and conform the process to fit the need we have now.

The problems claimed by the ones poised to the electoral college, as told in the second source "" The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, are that the process cause individuals to have little to no say in the person that will be their leader for years, they do not have control over who their candidates elect and must simply hope that they do indeed vote for who they promised to, also the election is decided by the few states that do not have a predetermined majority of voters in each state leaving the rest of the country feeling left out of the fiasco of the election and as if their perfered candidate dose not care of them or their support and opinions. This presents the system to be truly flawed in the way that it is currently operating.

Individuals,as source three ""In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, wish to claim that the system is not flawed in great lengths because it has worked for such a time that it is seen by them sufficient in its orcastration. It is said that the electors often do vote for who they pleaged they would and that decite is uncommon: however why should America risk the possibility of decite it has happened befor and if not prevented it will happen again. Do we not owe it to ourselves, posterity, and country to fix all potental harms to our nation the presidency should not be taken lightly it is a grand position that gives power and fame to all who hold those who have it could maintain the country, grace the nation with new prosperity, or condem Americans to years of suffering, toil, and misery. As citizens we should not alow anyone but the most valid character obtain this place. Mistakes are not alowed! we should take it upon ourselves now to modify this method be for it is to late and avertid.

There is no mitake America must act fast and modify this method for the nation, for their children, and for themselves.",0
"As we get older we want to travel to more places and get there faster, what if their was a quicker way without using cars. Certain places have been introducing a new concept, they calls themselves suburban pioneers. They live in places that have little or no cars, besides for the occasional bus, and all the stores that they would normally drive to are much closer now. Their are many beneficial points to this new way of life such as a dramatic drop in greenhouse gasses, a stress free way to live, and also who doesn't desire to save a buck or two. If people start to limit the usage of cars this planet might actually become a safer more joyful place to live.

In the past years greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed. The ozone layer is now trapping car exhaust fumes in earth and leading to what some might call global warming. Summer becomes hotter and longer, vice versa with winter. The U.S alone is to blame for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission. In europe it's 12 percent which is still quite a grave deal. Causes of not cutting back on the use of cars leads to tragic events such as the one that unfolded in Paris. Thier was so much smog in the air from motorized cars that for five days no one could start their cars unless they had a wish of paying a pricey fine. If people start to diminish the use of cars we can restore this humble planet to its former glory.

Forking out money for a car and having the luxury of fixing it up overtime a piece falls off or something malfunctions can become expensive quite rapidly. Who doesn't crave to save money anyways? Those who have chosen the suburban pioneer way of living have saved enormous enough of money. They don't have to pay for the insurance of the car and they don't have to pay to fix up the ole' rust bucket. Though some would rather have a car, but those who drive do the honors of car pulling which might not be the most time saving mechanism but in the long run it truely is beneficial. Also the government gains from all this. The government pays to build highways and roads for your car, but if cars aren't so common as time goes by roads get shorter and people start to get paid more because of all the money that the government is saving. Though money can't make us happy is still is an important piece to own in life.

In retrospect cars cause a lot of stress related problems. Everyone has one of those days where they wake up late and then suddenly remember that they have to get across town in a few minutes. Yes a car could get you there in less than no time, but wouldn't it be much simpler if you could just walk a closer distance. With the desecration of cars, stores and outlets would be much closer to your home. The stress of forgetting something at home and then having to drive 30 minutes to go get it would be diminished. Families could have more interaction with each other which means a closer bond could be formed. Receting the number of cars wouldn't be such an inhuman thing to do if you knew that the outcome was far more appealing.

To sum up, limiting the number of cars that roamed this earth would be more of a gain than a loss. Cars create hazardous gasses that are released into the air that are slowly but surely rendering us useless. Cars also cause safety hazards that can lead to a stressful environment. Plus if you don't use a car as often or get rid of it all together you can retain money for more important matters such as bills for your house or maybe a well deserved vacation. The posibilities are endless if we begin to limit the use of cars.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This essay will discuss the benefits of reducing car dependency based on the passages provided.

Firstly, reducing car usage can lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. The passages highlight that passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions. In Europe, they account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while some car-intensive areas in the United States contribute up to 50%. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where middle-class families tend to rely heavily on cars, it is possible to make a significant impact on reducing emissions.

Secondly, limiting car usage can improve the quality of life for individuals and communities. The passage on Vauban, Germany, demonstrates how residents are happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. One resident mentioned feeling tense when they owned a car but now feels much happier. This suggests that relying on alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or public transportation, can lead to a more relaxed and enjoyable lifestyle.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage on Vauban explains how the community is designed to be car-free, with only a few designated parking spaces available. This encourages residents to live closer to amenities and use public transportation or other forms of active transportation to get around. Placing stores on a walkable main street rather than in distant malls also promotes a sense of community and reduces the need for long commutes.

Furthermore, reducing car usage can have positive economic implications. The passage on Paris banning driving due to smog mentions that congestion decreased by 60% during the driving ban. This shows that limiting car usage can improve traffic flow and reduce the time wasted in congestion. Additionally, the passage on Car-free day in Bogota mentions that the event promotes alternative transportation and can lead to reduced smog. These factors can contribute to a more efficient and sustainable economy.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have several advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving quality of life, creating more accessible communities, and having positive economic implications. Based on the passages provided, it is clear that there is a growing trend in various countries to reduce car dependency and encourage alternative forms of transportation. By embracing this shift, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and enjoyable future.",1
"Starting with the end of World War II, cars have been a cultural hub all around the world, with businesses and even entire economies relying on the production and sale of cars and car products. However, after over sixty years of a car based global economy, the use of cars is beginning to slowly decline. With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and the dawn of a new era of culture and economy around the globe.

Several major cities around the world have attempted to lower caruse through laws or even annual days devoted to reduced caruse. In Vauban, Germany, seventy percent of the population does not own a car, and fifty three percent of that population sold a car to move to Vauban. Vauban has condensed its suburban layout so that everything is within practical walking range for the most part. They have also discouraged caruse by making parking only available in two places, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home"" Rosenthal, paragraph 2. Vauban has reported drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting ""carreduced"" communites in order to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, and legislators are acting on the issue. Experts claim that public transportation is beginning to play a larger role in suburbs, and a larger budget is now being given to public transportation instead of highways. Paris also has reduced driving to reduce smog, but they did it through laws. After suffering recordbreaking pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving. On Monday, evennumbered license plates could not drive, or they would be fined twenty two euros, or about thirty one dollars. On Tuesday, the same thing applied to odds. From this driving ban, congestion was lowered up to sixty percent in the French capital. Throughout multiple global cities, these reductions of caruse have had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and more cities are beginning to join in.

Along with the benifit of reduced greenhouse gases, carreduced societies also have a more relaxed living style. In Vauban Germany, citizens have claimed that they are enjoying a more relaxed life with much less stress. Heidrun Walter was quoted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal, paragraph 3. Andrew Selsky's article on carfree days in Bogota, Colombia also states that people enjoy the relief of less stress when they don't use their cars. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife"" Selsky, paragraph 24. If a drop in caruse leads to a happier, healthier life style, this will most likely set off a cyclicle action of caruse reduction to relief of stress and back to caruse reduction. As more people realize this potential benifit of reducing caruse, more people will beginning to join the population of reduced caruse.

The vast empire of cars that began with the end of World War II has reached its peak and is beginning a steady decline. For nearly seventy years, cars and car products have been a cultural and economical stimulant in both developed and developing countries. From the ModelT to the Buggatti, cars have been percieved as the thing to have over radios, television, and other mass media. Now that they are becoming less used, culture will slowly begin to shift to a different source to hype about. The production of new models of cars and new types of cars will slow and eventually halt all together. As well as culture evolving to a new phase, economy will also undergo major changes. Economy all around the world has been stimulated by auto industries, and international trade has been influenced heavily by it. For example, foreign cars are driven in America more often than domesticallymanufactured cars. Now that caruse is declining, the economy will suffer a major crash in stocks in the auto industry. Although this crash will harm the economy, the everchanging population of Earth will quickly find some new innovation to obssess over and the market will quickly recover and improve on this new product. With a new culture and economy, the world will be in a new era, a new age of living.

With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and a possibilty of a new era of culture and economy around the globe. As the problems with cars are found, people have and will continue to resolve the problem by reducing caruse. The Earth will become healthier with a nicer atmosphere, the population will lead happier lives, and culture itself will transform with the end of major caruse.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Changing to Election by Popular Vote

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my strong support for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democracy, ensuring fair representation and preventing the tyranny of the majority.

The Office of the Federal Register describes the Electoral College as a process that was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. This compromise was intended to strike a balance between the authority of individual states and the need for a unifying national leader. By allowing smaller states to have a voice in the election, the Electoral College ensures that candidates are not solely focused on winning over highly populated areas, but rather on appealing to a diverse range of voters across the country.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is that it provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winner of the electoral vote usually exceeds his or her share of the popular vote. This means that disputes and challenges over the election results are less likely than if we were to rely solely on the popular vote. The winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes also helps to avoid the need for run-off elections, ensuring a clear winner and preventing further complications in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a majority of states, rather than just a majority of individuals. This prevents candidates from exclusively focusing on highly populated regions or urban centers, but instead encourages them to campaign and address the concerns of voters from a wide range of states. This is particularly important in a country as diverse and expansive as the United States, where the needs and interests of each region may vary significantly.

The argument that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters is baseless. Although some voters in ""safe"" states may feel that their vote does not swing a national election, the purpose of voting in a presidential election is to express a political preference, not to singlehandedly decide the outcome. Furthermore, studies have shown that voter turnout remains high, indicating that individuals still value their ability to participate in the democratic process, even if their state consistently leans towards a particular party.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair and outdated, it is essential to recognize the practical reasons for its existence. A direct popular vote may lead to the concentration of campaign efforts and policies around a handful of heavily populated states, leaving the rest of the country without adequate representation. By maintaining the Electoral College, we can preserve the integrity of our democracy and ensure that candidates are held accountable to the diverse interests of the entire nation.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the practical benefits of the Electoral College and support its continuation. While there may be valid arguments for reforming the system, changing to a pure popular vote would have unintended consequences and risk further undermining the representation of certain states and voter groups. The Electoral College provides a fair and balanced method for electing the President of the United States, and it is crucial that we uphold its principles in order to maintain the strength and stability of our democracy.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your continued support for the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Many people in the world today think that cars and driving everywhere is a necessity however, many people feel that owning a car is ""impractical and undesirable."" paragraph 43 There are many advantages to having cars, but there are also many more advantages to not using cars wherever people go. Some advantages include conserving resources, making people have a little more money in their pocket and it also improves safety in many suburban cities.

In the world today, a major problem that still exists is greenhouse gases. Cars emit a lot of gas that isn't good for the environment. In the first source, it says that people living in cities ""is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent...in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States.""paragraph 5 Exports mean to say that it is better for people to live in cities so they don't have to drive everywhere. This means that the more people that live in cities, the less gas goes into the air. In Paris, the city issued a ban for driving to try and reduce the smog. The second source says that ""congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" paragraph 14 Only after five days of the no driving ban, more than half of the smog was gone in Paris. It also says that the amount of smog was almost as polluted at the city of Beijing, China, which is the most polluted city in the world. Bogota also did the same thing. They have an event called ""A Day Without Cars."" Participant Carlos Arturo Plaza says it is a good way ""to take away stress and lower air pollution.""paragraph 24 They also got other cities, and even other countries, to follow suit and join the event. America faces the same problem as Paris too many greenhouse gases are being put into the atmosphere. President Obama has a goal that he wants to achieve and that is to try and make the environment healthy. The last article says that driving less ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.""paragraph 34 This implies that the amount of gases let into the air will be reduced. If peolpe didn't drive as much from place to place, the world would be a happier, healthier place.

Apart from the fact that cars give of gas, not driving everwhere also means people save more money. In Vauban, Germany, nobody has any cars, they walk or bike to wherever they need to go. ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the egde of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.""paragraph 2 People would be more inclined to not getting a car rather than spend an extra 40 grand on top of getting a house for a parking space. Also, in Paris, a fine was issued for people who drove their cars during the car ban. The second article says ""evennumber license plastes were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine..""paragraph 11 If people didn't drive their cars around when they weren't supposed to, they would still have the 22 euros they lost. The same type of fine was issued in Bogota, Columbia. If people drove their cars on ""A Day Without Cars"", then they would have to face a 25 fine. However, in the United States, ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""paragraph 29 Without having to pay for a car or gas money, Americans are saving way more money they had been when they first got a car. Wit people not having to worry about payments or gas prices, they have more money in their wallet.

Not only does not driving save money and reduce gas, it also improves cities and people's lives. Heidrun Walter, a German media trainer, says that ""when she had a car, she was always tense. She's much happier this way."" paragraph 3 She likes not having to drive everywhere, it makes her feel more calm and less tense. It's not only changing peoples lives, but it's changing the cities. Cities are attempting ""to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with eless space for parking.""paragraph 6 Cities are changing their apperance in order to intice people into driving less and walking or biking more. They intend to make the stores closer together rather than having to drive across the highway to get to the next store. Also in Bogota, there has been a ""cunstruction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and ""parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city.""paragraphs 27&28 With more people walking, the city wants to make the outside apperance different and more appealing than what it looked like before people just used cars. Not driving is not only good for personal well being, but for the a city's well being.

There are many advantages to driving cars, such as saving time and getting to places faster but, not driving cars is way better in the long run because of a better environment, saving money and better cities and personal health.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various cities around the world. This trend is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit.

One example of a car-limited community is Vauban in Germany. The streets of Vauban are completely car-free, except for a few main thoroughfares and designated parking areas at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move to this car-free community. This demonstrates that living without cars can lead to a happier and less stressful lifestyle.

The benefits of limiting car usage go beyond personal well-being. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease carbon emissions and combat climate change. Additionally, limiting cars can help alleviate traffic congestion, particularly in densely populated areas. This improves overall transportation efficiency and reduces the time and money wasted in traffic jams.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the development of sustainable and walkable communities. Instead of relying on cars to access daily necessities like shopping centers, stores are placed within walking distance in these car-limited communities. This not only encourages physical activity but also reduces the need for large parking lots and encourages the use of public transportation. In fact, many car-limited communities offer free or discounted public transit as an alternative to owning a car.

Car-limited initiatives have been implemented in various cities worldwide. Paris, for example, enforced a partial driving ban during a period of intense smog. This led to a significant decrease in congestion and air pollution. Bogota in Colombia has also successfully organized car-free days to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These examples show that limiting car usage is a viable and effective solution to combat environmental issues and create more livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, reduces traffic congestion, and promotes sustainable and walkable communities. Car-limited communities like Vauban in Germany have shown that living without cars can lead to a more enjoyable and sustainable lifestyle. As the world continues to face environmental challenges, it is crucial that we prioritize the limitation of car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation for a greener future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, called ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and has numerous advantages. Limiting car usage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more accessible and pedestrian-friendly communities.

One of the major benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, suburban communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint. For example, in Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited and the emphasis is on walking and biking, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This results in lower emissions and a more sustainable lifestyle.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In cities like Paris, where driving was partially banned due to smog, congestion decreased by 60 percent and the air became clearer. Diesel fuel was identified as a major contributor to the smog, emphasizing the need to transition to cleaner modes of transportation. By reducing car usage and promoting electric vehicles or hybrids, communities can improve air quality and create healthier environments for their residents.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can promote more accessible and pedestrian-friendly communities. The traditional suburban model, centered around car ownership and spread-out homes with private garages, has limited accessibility and forced people to rely heavily on cars for transportation. However, by adopting the principles of smart planning, communities can place stores within walking distance, create bike lanes and pedestrian paths, and improve public transportation infrastructure. This not only reduces the need for cars but also promotes a sense of community and livability.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. By reducing the dependence on cars, communities can focus on improving public transit and alternative modes of transportation. This can lead to cost savings for individuals and less spending on maintaining roads and parking infrastructure. It can also create opportunities for new businesses, such as bike-sharing programs and carpooling services. In Bogota, Colombia, the car-free day initiative has been successful in reducing traffic jams and promoting alternative transportation, leading to positive economic and social changes.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas has multiple advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more accessible communities, and can have positive economic impacts. By adopting the principles of smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, communities can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future. It is important for individuals and governments to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and take proactive steps towards implementing such measures.",1
"Car, bikes, walking and such are many forms of transportation. Cars are the main favorite overall. But as time continues we see that the drastic need for cars is growing smaller and smaller because we are now seeing the bigger picture limiting car usage is a bigger plus than a negative.

In Vauban,German the suburb is going ""carfree"". Rosenthal speaks about how Vauban allows cars but there are only two locations where they may park these cars. If you want to park your car you must buy a space for 40,000, and a home along with your parking space. Due to these facts 70% of Vauban families do not own a car. An advantage of this limited car usage is that people like Heidrum Walter speak about how she is much happier and less tense without her car.

Vauban is in an area that is more accessible to public transportation and closer to stores. The closeness allows people easier accessablity to buses, or walking and biking places. With everything close its easier to get to point A to B. Also reduces pollution and greenhouse gases due to the fact they aren't using cars to get to there locations.

In Source 2 Duffer, speaks about how in Paris bans are being placed against the usage against cars, due to the fact Paris has a high level of smog. Paris had motorists with evennumbered license plates on Mondays leave there cars home or suffer a fine. On Tuesday motorists with oddnumbered license plates were to leave cars home or suffer a fine. The advantage of this ban is that having so many people leave there cars home on Monday allowed the smog to clear enough that the ban for Tuesday was rescind. If Paris were to do this ban for a couple of years there smog issue would be completely gone. This would be a major advantage for them, it would give them less pollution, not as many people getting sick due to the smog, and a less car dependent city.

An event was created in Bogota, Colombia called A Day Without Cars. Which was to have people go carfree for a day. Colombians used many other transportations such as biking, buses, and hiking. This event allowed smog to be reduced due to the fact Colombians could not use a car this day or be fined. Also this event helped spark other areas want to pertake in this event. This was a huge advantage having many other places join A Day Without Cars this meant more areas helping reduce smog and helping many more areas become aware of the fact cars dont have to be the only form of transportation people use.

All in all if areas become less car dependent, there shall be less smog, pollutions and lastly people wont have to travel as far due to the fact everything will be closer. The smaller amount of cars we have, the more positive outcomes.",0
"Dear State Senator, I think we should get rid of the electoral college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the electoral college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non democratic method of selecting our president. It should be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

Another reason why would get rid of the electoral college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign.

It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Whats wrong the electoral College?

When we are under the electoral College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.",0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The majority of people that own a car have a lot of stress due to gas money and paying for the car. Owning a car is a serious expense. There are other types of transportation that can be useful for the people.

According to Source 1, in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of the people that live there do not own a car, and 57 percent sold a car in order to move there. People were starting to realize that when they owned a car they would always be tense. After getting rid of the car, they have been much happier and less stressed.

Since there are less cars in the streets of Germany, people have stopped and realized how beautiful everything was. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, is now relived as she walks the verdant streets where she can hear the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children.

In Paris, France due to the cold nights and warm days, the car emissions have been trapped by the warmer layer of air. Sometimes, weather can be the effect of something bad happening to your car. In the everyday world, people have been killed and have been in serious accidents. Not only because of the weather but also because of the lack of responsibility and concentration it takes to drive a vehicle.

As said in Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia many people do not drive cars. The majority of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work or wherever they need to go. The goal of this is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman, said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" while he was riding his bicycle along with his wife next to him.

As people ride bike or hike or even just walk around their city, they can see and learn many new things just by being more aware of their surroundings. Cars have been in this world for a long period of time already. It's time to take a break from the madness and start realizing how beautiful life is and how beautiful it can be by not destroying it with such a machine. Not only will there be less stress, but the world will be a lot more safer than it was.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation as our method of electing the President of the United States. While there are certainly arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential purpose in our democratic process and should not be abolished.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome after a presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is lower compared to a dispute over the popular vote. Additionally, the winner-take-all system ensures that even a slight plurality in a state can create a significant victory in the electoral vote.

Another critical advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is representative of the entire nation rather than just one region. As Judge Posner points out, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign nationally and appeal to voters across different regions. It prevents candidates with only regional popularity from being elected and helps prevent a sense of disenfranchisement among residents of regions that may feel neglected.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system focuses campaign efforts on swing states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. These states are more likely to receive significant attention from candidates, and as a result, voters in these states become more educated and thoughtful voters. This gives them a greater impact on the outcome of the election and ensures that their interests are taken into account.

In addition to ensuring regional representation, the Electoral College also helps to balance the power of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance for large states that lose representation in the Senate due to population mal-apportionment. This ensures that presidential candidates do not solely focus on states with higher populations and instead allows for attention to be given to states of varying sizes.

Lastly, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for run-off elections. As seen in previous elections, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, even if the candidate does not receive a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the complication and expense of additional elections and allows for a smooth and efficient process of selecting the president.

While arguments can be made against the Electoral College, I believe that the advantages it provides, such as certainty of outcome, balanced regional representation, and the avoidance of run-off elections, outweigh the perceived disadvantages. As stated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College is a compromise that was established by the Founding Fathers to ensure fair and balanced representation in the election of the President. It is a process that has served our nation well for over two centuries, and I believe it should continue to do so.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope you will consider my perspective and support the preservation of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The Electoral College system is not something American citizens should experience. Theis system of voting has many flaws, even some of the top political leaders such as richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter agree. I believe that we should get rid of the electoral college system and change it to election by popular vote for president for these reasons, It is unfair to voters and the electoral college has a big disaster factor.

The electoral college system is very unfair towards voters. Under this system voters aren't even voting for president, rather they are voting for a slate of electors who vote for the president. Ins't that the whole point of voting for president that you actually vote for president? Well under this system it is impossible. In source 2 it gives the example, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes"". As show in this statement when voters want to vote for president they dont actually vote for president, in turn they vote for electoral votes. This defeats the whole purpose of Americans voting for their president. This goes against the American ideal that American is a Democracy in which people vote for their leaders. Another reason why this system is unfair to voters is because of its winnertakeall system in each state. According to source 2 "", candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This in turn is unfair to those people in the states where candidates didn't visit. As mentioned in source 1 ""Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This statement is not at all fair. It is saying that the electors of the winning candidates team are rewarded while the other electors on the other side are not. How is this in any way fair towards the oposing teams electors? All of this is caused by the winnertakeall system caused by electoral college, which again is unfair to many American citizens.

Another reason why we should get rid of the electoral college system is because of its disaster factor. Americans should considers themselves lucky due to the whole 2000 election crisis which was the biggest in a century. This system allows for much worse to happen during these elections. Getting rid of it is one of the only ways to solve that problem. This system causes many problems, for example source 2 states ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. P"" This shows that this system has caused many mishaps in the past that could occur again. The American people should not be subject to these disasters. Another disaster factor that goes along with the electoral college system is that some electors have not voted for their own party, causing a disturbance in the voting. Source 2 states ""In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" In no way shape or form is this fair towards the candidates party's. This infidelity can sway the predicted outcome of the election. Resulting in a surprise for many of America's citizens when they see the voting results. This electoral college system can cause many different problems resulting in disasters. A few have already happened in the past, as mentioned, and America shouldn't have to endure another one. This is why we should eliminate the electoral college system and change to election by popular vote for president.

All and all, the electoral college is unfair and disasterous. It causes many issues with the voting for President in America. Many Americans believe that is system is definatly not working. This is why we need to change to election by popular vote. Famous politition Bob Dole one stated, ""Abolish the electoral college!"" and he seems to be right.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for society and the environment. One of the main benefits is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report from the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage of reducing car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the case of Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped reduce the pollution levels in the city (Duffer). Similarly, in Bogota, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event was successful in reducing traffic jams and encouraging citizens to use public transportation, walk, or bike (Selsky).

Limiting car usage can also make urban areas more compact and accessible. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and instead rely on bicycles, public transportation, and walking. This has led to a more vibrant community with stores and amenities within walking distance (Rosenthal). By adopting this approach in more suburban areas, we can reduce urban sprawl and create neighborhoods that are less dependent on cars.

Additionally, reducing car usage can have positive health impacts. Research shows that people who walk, bike, or use public transportation as their primary mode of transportation have better overall health and are less likely to suffer from obesity and heart disease (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can encourage more physical activity and improve the well-being of individuals.

While there may be concerns about the impact on the car industry, it is important to adapt to changing behaviors and prioritize the environment and public health. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle (Rosenthal). This shift in focus can lead to the development of alternative modes of transportation that are more sustainable and less reliant on individual car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about several advantages for society and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more compact and accessible communities, the benefits of reducing car usage are significant. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and prioritizing the environment and public health, we can work towards a more sustainable future.",1
"Dear Senator, If you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don't even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors ""vote for president and vice president,"" and then are counted by the Congress Source 1, paragraph 1. They don't realize that their votes can be overridden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntled about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.

Most voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, ""... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,"" paragraph 9. Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. As active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. We want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not overridden.

We need a system us as people can control ourselves. As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, ""Who picks the electors in the first place?"" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state government in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidential candidates themselves can pick them paragraph 10! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,"" paragraph 15. It's outrageous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.

As you probably already know, each state's ""...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation..."" Source One, paragraph 3. Most representatives spend most of their time campaigning in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. ""In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all..."" and that campaign was refered to as a ""fiasco"" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute Selection 2, paragraph 13. This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states or larger ones ""... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates,"" paragraph 20.

Selection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, ""... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,"" paragraph 12. This shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly.

Altough many downfalls, ""The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose"" and ""avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,""Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22. Yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 5050. Just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.

Therefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. We demand for a direct system! So I ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the Electorial Colleges.

Sincerly, A concerned citizen.",0
"Many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use to the public. There comes some great advantages when doing this. You can help limit greenhouse gases, relieve the stress from cars, and become less dependent on your car for transportation.

The big advantage about limiting cars is to help prevent the rapid spread of greenhouse gases the creates smog in cities. From source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions polluting cities even more. With these dangerous gases in the air, the world is in great danger of becoming unhealthy and we are to blame for this awful cause because of the over use of cars. By limiting the use of cars you limit the amount of pollution in the air.

By limiting car use an finding other means of transportation, you can actually relieve stress put on you from the constant beeping and noises made by cars. By walking or riding a bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds of the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good to you and the environment. Some people, as seen in source three, have taken this experience of the limiting of cars to share the experience with their companion riding a twoseated bike. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" By limiting the use of cars you begin to be less depended on cars. By this happening you learn your life will know longer be circled around your car and you begin to see that driving a car everyday is not really needed. By using public transportation of carpooling you greatly decrease the amount of pollution in the air while also having a ride to work or where ever you need to be.

Limiting cars can have multiple advantages to it. You can help stop half of the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars, relieve stress, and become less dependent for the need a car. This will cause you to become a better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds of generations to come.",0

Subject: Maintaining the Electoral College or Transitioning to Popular Vote for Presidential Elections

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in determining the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, including the summaries you provided, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our democratic system.

First and foremost, the Electoral College is a process that was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and direct popular vote. As outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a candidate needs at least 270 electoral votes to be elected as President. This ensures that candidates have to gain support from a diverse range of states rather than relying solely on the popular vote, thus ensuring that the President represents the interests of a broader spectrum of citizens.

A major advantage of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of an election. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, we avoid disputes over the popular vote. Even if a candidate has a slight advantage in a state, they receive all the electoral votes from that state. This helps prevent the need for tedious recounts and minimizes the potential for controversy surrounding the election results.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign more widely across multiple states. Posner emphasizes that candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the necessary electoral votes. This system prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated or swing states, as they need support from a variety of regions. Therefore, it ensures that the President does not overlook the interests of citizens from different parts of the country. Furthermore, it encourages candidates to address the concerns and needs of residents in smaller or less populated states, ensuring their voices are heard in the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance to the political influence of large states compared to smaller ones. As Posner explains, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives smaller states less political weight. By assigning electoral votes based on congressional representation, the Electoral College restores some of the weight to large states, enabling more attention from presidential candidates. This system prevents the disenfranchisement of citizens in large states and maintains the relevance of their voices in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process. Instead, it consistently produces a clear winner. This is crucial in ensuring a stable and efficient transfer of power, preventing prolonged periods of uncertainty and potential political turmoil.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as the issue of regional favoritism, I believe that the benefits it offers outweigh the drawbacks. It helps maintain a balance between large and small states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, and ensures a clear outcome in the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College or potentially exploring alternative solutions that keep its key principles intact. It is essential to protect the fairness, stability, and representativeness of our democratic system. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"State Senator, The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for who you would like to win, you are voting for an electors who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for who we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there has also been a few fiasco.

This style of voting has been going on since the beginning, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electorss they are not reliable. ""Can voters control whom their electorss vote for? Not always."" This right here proves that the electorss don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electorss anyways? ""Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" We don't even get to select our electorss, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for who we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,"" This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.

The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabotage the election. What is stopping more poeple from this? Some electorss refused to vote for who they said they would. ""faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electorss to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who ""validated only his opponent's electorss, but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent.'"" Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.

In conclusion, more people are against the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Less people would have a problem with the election process and it would go a lot smoother.",0
"Dear Senator of Florida, Being a man of your caliber and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today because I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to today economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of ""If it aint broke dont fix it."" Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.

Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.

Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popular votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number538. Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.

In closing, I just wanted to express my thoughts about the electoral vote process with you today. I believe its very unfair, outdated, and irrational. With all the infractions that can occur and risks that are involved, I believe it needs to be changed. And I believe now is time for that change! Thank you.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and create more vibrant and walkable neighborhoods. These benefits have been observed in various places around the world where car usage has been limited.

One example is Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars (Rosenthal, paragraph 3). This is because cars can be a source of tension and anxiety. In contrast, walking and biking in car-free neighborhoods can provide a sense of freedom and connection to the community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, paragraph 5). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and biking, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality, especially in cities where smog is a significant problem. Paris implemented a driving ban in response to severe smog, and congestion decreased by 60 percent (Duffer, paragraph 14). This demonstrates how reducing car usage can have an immediate positive impact on air quality. Diesel fuel, often favored in France due to tax policies, is a major contributor to air pollution (Duffer, paragraph 16). Encouraging the use of cleaner modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles or bikes, can help combat this issue.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to create more vibrant and walkable communities. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day is held annually, during which millions of people use alternative modes of transportation. This event aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Selsky, paragraph 21). Such initiatives can lead to the construction of bike paths, parks, and improved infrastructure for pedestrians. As a result, neighborhoods become more accessible, enjoyable, and conducive to social interaction.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and create more vibrant neighborhoods. Initiatives in various parts of the world have demonstrated the positive impact of limiting car usage, and it is essential that more communities adopt measures to encourage alternative modes of transportation. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Dear Florida State senator, I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. inputting this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S citizens opinion on who the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.

As you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much workmuch more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they compromise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.

While reading an article about the electoral collegeby Brad Plumer, I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a ""Disaster Factor"" according to paragraph 11 in the article ""The indefensible Electoral College"" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other peopleNo party, Democrats, etc. that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.

The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.",0
"Car-free cities have become a subject of increasing interest and debate in recent years, as urban areas around the world grapple with the challenges of congestion, pollution, and limited resources. The concept of a car-free city involves creating urban environments where private automobiles are either significantly restricted or completely banned, with a focus on alternative transportation methods and sustainable urban planning. This essay explores the benefits, challenges, and potential solutions associated with the idea of car-free cities.  Benefits of Car-Free Cities  Environmental Sustainability: Car-free cities promote environmental sustainability by reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Fewer cars on the road mean cleaner air and a significant decrease in the contribution to global warming.  Improved Public Health: A reduction in automobile usage can lead to better public health outcomes. Fewer cars on the road result in fewer accidents and a safer urban environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Moreover, less air pollution can lead to reduced respiratory and cardiovascular problems.  Efficient Use of Space: Car-free cities utilize urban space more efficiently. Parking lots and wide roads can be repurposed for green spaces, parks, and pedestrian zones, enhancing the overall quality of life in the city.  Reduced Traffic Congestion: By eliminating or restricting car usage, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to faster commute times and less frustration for residents and commuters.  Cost Savings: Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive. Car-free cities allow residents to save money on vehicles, fuel, and insurance, improving their overall financial well-being.  Challenges of Car-Free Cities  Resistance to Change: Transitioning to a car-free city can face resistance from citizens, especially those who rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: An effective public transportation system is crucial for the success of car-free cities. Cities need to invest in and expand their public transportation networks to ensure that people have viable alternatives to cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that rely on car-dependent customers may experience a decline in revenue in a car-free city. It's essential to address this economic impact and find ways to support affected businesses during the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The redesign of urban areas for car-free living requires significant planning and investment in infrastructure, which can be a lengthy and complex process.  Solutions for Car-Free Cities  Expand Public Transportation: Invest in the expansion and improvement of public transportation systems to provide convenient and affordable alternatives to private cars.  Promote Active Transportation: Encourage walking and cycling by building bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly streets, and ensuring safe infrastructure for these activities.  Implement Carpooling and Ride-Sharing: Promote carpooling and ride-sharing services to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road.  Adopt Electric and Sustainable Transportation: Encourage the use of electric vehicles and promote sustainability by using renewable energy sources to power transportation.  Education and Public Awareness: Educate citizens about the benefits of a car-free city and involve them in the planning process to increase support and understanding.  Conclusion  Car-free cities represent a vision for a sustainable and healthier urban future. While the transition to a car-free city is not without challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, and efficient urban living make it a compelling goal. Through a combination of investment in public transportation, promotion of alternative transportation methods, and public engagement, cities can work towards a future where cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities offer a promising vision of a more sustainable and vibrant urban environment.",1
"Many countries world wide have gone ""carfree"" due to either smog or other areas has simply banned them. Not only is banning cars good for the environment it is also good for the well being of the human race. In the following passages ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Carfree day is a big hit in Bogota"", and ""The End of Car Culture"" mention the finner points about why being ""carfree"" is beneficial.

By far, Europe is once again ahead of the United States due to the fact that many countries dont use cars, but they travel to their next destination by train, tram, bus, and walikng. Unlike America, almost every one is using a car to get to their next place, and barely use a bus. According to the passage "" The End of Car Culture"" our own president of the United States is making goals to help improve the ""greenhouse gas emissions"" but just like the title suggest the end of cars are near. "" The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures"" researchers are noticing a decline in the buying and selling of cars nation wide. ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.""It has already accelerated in Europes biggest capitals the world has come to know and love.

Paris. The ""city of love"" or the city of smog, has banned driving due to record high reports of smog. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" according to the passage "" Paris bans driving due to smog"" smog in the ""city of love"" is not quite romantic as a city without smog. Paris alone ""... had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter..."". Banning cars and fining people is one way to help clear the air of pollution, so their is more room for love, laughter, and happiness. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" well maybe the smog and love can share the air. Lets travel all the way back to the Americas to see how the smog is doing there in the countyr of Colombia.

Bogota, Colombia located in South America has had its own little smog problems just like Paris. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" a whole day of either biking, hiking, skating, walking,or taking a taxi andor bus, to get to work or school. In the Passage ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" explains to us why we should stop using cars but rather rely on our body than a 3,000 pound peice of machinerery. "" The days without cars is part of an imporvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s."". For almost 25 years Bogota, Colombia once a year celebrates a day to help reduce smog, and produce a happy, healthy, and smog free life style. ""'The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,'"" remarks Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. there may have been a few gray clouds, but that doesnt keep people form not supporting their own environment. Good Job to Bogota, and see what tricks Germany has up their sleeve.

Picture this: an upscale suburban community in Vauban, Germany where soccer moms are taking there children to soccer practice, and big CEO executives are going to work. They're getting to their next destination not by car, because in this town of 5,500 people, nobody has a car because they have give up the life of ""Car Culture"". The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", well truely they do. Who needs cars when you go to work by bike, train, skateboard, roller skates, or the traditional walking. ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called 'smart planning.'"" What amkes this ""smart planning"" truely genius, is that everbody is totally cool with it. For ""the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs..."". Vauban may be just an experimental suburb, but the people who live in it seem to enjoy the life without the hastle of smog producing vehicles. ""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" states Heidrum walter, a resident of the green suburban town Vaubran.

Many countries world wide have gone ""carfree"" due to either smog or maybe even banned them entirely. Countries all over the wolrd are seeing a difference in their community every day when they don't drive a car. not only is going ""carfree"" great for the reduction of smog, but you can live a happier, healthier, and stressfree life style like most people have noitced from Bogota, Colombia to the small suburban town Vauban, Geramny. Next time when you leave your house for work, just think how stressfree you'll be if you biked, walked, or take the train.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a system based on popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College serves as a crucial mechanism in our democratic system for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, where disputes over the result could occur more frequently, the Electoral College guarantees that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear and decisive outcome, reducing the likelihood of a prolonged and contentious election process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president being everyone's president. As the system requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no particular region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to campaign across the entire nation, listening to and addressing the concerns of voters from different regions. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the interests of diverse populations and prevents potential feelings of disenfranchisement among citizens from unrepresented regions.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This has the benefit of engaging voters in those states and encouraging them to pay close attention to the campaign and the candidates' messages. The focused attention of these thoughtful voters allows them to make well-informed decisions during the election, ultimately resulting in a more informed electorate.

The Electoral College also balances the political influence between small and large states. While the Constitution grants disproportionate power to small states in the Senate, the Electoral College redistributes some of that weight by providing more attention to large states during presidential campaigns. Candidates are compelled to address the concerns and needs of citizens in both small and large states, ensuring that no state is overlooked or disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, which could complicate and prolong the electoral process. In its current form, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, providing stability and efficiency to the presidential election process.

While some argue against the Electoral College, suggesting that it discourages potential voters in states they consider unwinnable, the fact remains that a significant portion of the American population still participates in presidential elections. This suggests that voters are motivated to express their political preferences rather than solely focusing on the impact of their vote on the outcome. The Electoral College does not undermine voter engagement in presidential elections; instead, it balances the interests of various states and guarantees a fair representation of the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democratic system, providing certainty of outcome, ensuring that the president is everyone's president, promoting thoughtful voter engagement, balancing state influence, and avoiding run-off elections. Its merits outweigh the arguments put forth in favor of a popular vote for the president. I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College and resist any efforts to change it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Dear state senator, I believe that we shouldn't keep the electoral college process because it should be in favor of the popular vote for the president of the Unites States instead of how it is now. I believe this because for example with this system voters don't vote for the president but for the slate of electors even though this system does come with some positives like it allows them to focus on their campaign efforts but can turn into a complete disaster factor.

To begin with,the system of the electoral college does not allow the voters to vote for the president but only for a slate of electors, they are the ones who elect the president. There is always an offchance that those electors that won the statewide election would go to Congress and the opponent receives more electoral votes. The electors are chosen from the state they could be state conventions, or the state party's central committee and even sometimes the presidential candidate themselves. This system then leads to several cons such as the voters can not control whom their electors vote for and also the voters tend to get confused sometimes about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

Although, maybe we should be able to keep our despised method of choosing the president because, it comes with several pro's like for example, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible like in 2012's election when Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the votes that came from rodney. In this election the winner is aware with the electoral votes which induces the candidates and allows them to focuses on their campaign efforts. Lead them to the tossup states which basically mean they are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign so the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Last but not least, this system is also known a the disaster factor like for example the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century because they had to consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and that they will always define the will of those people. Many of the electors have occasionally refused to vote for their own party candidate and even cast a deciding vote for whomever it is that they want or perfer to please. this method should not be prohibited any more because of the causes it is doing which is affec In conclusion it is official the the system of the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and also it is concluded to be an irrational system. I still believe that the electoral college should be elected by popular vote for the president.",0
"I believe we the people should be able to vote for who we want for president. We have always been told we have a freedom of speech, yet we cannot truly vote for who we want for president. The votes are all taken and used to see who is more popular with the people. But who decided who gets to be president is not us. It is the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a group of people in each state who decide the president for us. I think everyone should get to vote on who they want as president, and i think it should actually count. The Electoral College is unfair and I believe popular vote should decide who we get as the president of the nation that we have or rights to vote in.

In the words of Bob Dole ""Abolish the electoral college."" It is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It is unfair because of the winnertakesall system there is in each state. With this in place the candidates take no time in the states they know they have not of chance of winning in. Instead they spend all of their time in states they may have a tight race in. for example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Twentyfive of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad. Under the Electoral College system they do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who then turn around and vote for the president they want. Is that really fair. That we are putting our nations future in the hands of only 538 people.

Popular votes should be what decides our president. Therefore we actually have a say in who we want to be president. For example, in the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but because of the Electoral College Bush won because he had 271 electoral votes while Gore had 266. Also in the election in2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes comparing to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Sure he still would have won but at least individual people actually had a say in who they got as their president. Also in 2012, the popular vote was very close in Florida, but Obama won the electoral vote with 29. But in Wyoming the same thing happened and he only got three electoral votes. This shows a large state gets more attention in presidential candidates than a small state does. If presidency was decided by the individual votes then it wouold be more fair and more poeple would have a say in it.

If this country really gave us the right to vote then we would really have a say in who we want as our president. But the Electoral College is not letting us do that. Only two states do something a little differently, but it still does not make that much of a difference. If we had more of a say in our presidency i believe we would be a better nation more people would actually vote cause there would be a better chance of them actually having a say in what they want for this nation.",0

Subject: In Favor of Maintaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. This unique process, established by our founding fathers as a compromise, ensures a fair and balanced representation of all states. While some argue for a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College has many advantages that should be considered.

To begin with, the Electoral College provides the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged disputes over close election results, as we have witnessed in the past. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could potentially lead to endless recounts and legal battles, undermining the stability and integrity of our democratic process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country. Each region has a different set of concerns and priorities, and it is imperative that our elected leaders take them all into account. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal in order to secure the necessary electoral votes, the Electoral College encourages presidential contenders to address the needs and concerns of voters across the entire nation.

Additionally, the Electoral College system gives attention to swing states. In competitive elections, candidates focus their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states are more engaged and informed about the candidates' policies and positions. By allowing swing states to have a significant impact on the election outcome, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters play a crucial role in deciding the president.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it restores balance between large and small states. The malapportionment of the Senate, mandated by the Constitution, gives small states a greater say in our legislative branch. The Electoral College allows large states to regain some influence by rewarding them with more electoral votes. This balanced approach ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account during presidential campaigns.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. This system guarantees that a clear winner emerges from the election, even if they do not secure an outright majority of the popular vote. This helps to streamline the electoral process, preventing the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections.

While critics argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states that are heavily skewed towards one party, the fact remains that nearly half of eligible Americans cast their vote in the most recent presidential election. Voters see their participation as an opportunity to express their political preference, rather than believing that their individual vote will single-handedly determine the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has proven itself to be a vital and effective method for electing our president. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages attention to swing states, balances large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages contribute to a fair and stable presidential election process, and therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments for and against the Electoral College in making your decision. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"Do you think you would be able to live without your car? It would be less difficult than you think! In fact, there is a whole town named Vauban, Germany, that has given up their cars! According to Source 1, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, unless of course you have the money to buy a parking garage space for a whopping 40,000. A citizen of the carless town, Heidrum Walter admits, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas of the US, according to Source 1. If only we had more towns like Vauban, maybe our impact on the world would be less destructive.

Some towns ban cars for a few days at a time. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of nearrecord pollution. Congestion in Paris went down 60 percent and the smog from the pollution cleared up enough that they rescind the ban. Some people would complain that having little to no cars will be an issue for jobs, delivery companies, or getting children to and from places. There's always a bus, and there's always the option of car pooling! Bogota, Columbia is another town that has done a car free day, except Bogota's is annual. These Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to places during the carfree day, according to Source 3. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of this annual carfree day, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in Bogota. I think more towns should ban cars for just a few days. We could all get a little excersize, help the environment, and improve our mood and lower stress!

A recent study found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, Source 4 says. The number of miles driven in the US was at it's height in 2005 and dropped steadily after. In April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was almost 9 percent below that peak! Some sociologists believe that if this pattern continues, it will have lots of beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, according to Source 4. Some places, such as New York, have carsharing programs and bikesharing programs, which is a nice way to get from place to place that's healthy for you and your environment.

There's so many reasons why we should use our cars less! Like I explained, it's very healthy for your environment, and if you choose to walk or bike, its healthy for your body, too. Also, pollution rates would go down quite a lot if we would just carpool or walkbike to places! People have said that they feel so much happier and stress free from not using a car all the time.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I write to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider not changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers, serves as a vital process in ensuring the fair and balanced representation of all states in our nation. It allows for a compromise between election by Congress and direct popular vote, ensuring that the interests and concerns of both small and large states are taken into account.

Firstly, the certainty of outcome is one of the primary advantages of the Electoral College. Unlike the popular vote system, where a dispute over the outcome is more likely, the Electoral College reduces the chances of such disputes. With the winner-take-all method, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Hence, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely, minimizing the potential for electoral crisis.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" It ensures that a presidential candidate must have a trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on strong support from one particular region. This requirement prevents candidates from neglecting the interests of certain regions and encourages them to be mindful of the diverse needs of the entire nation.

Moreover, the focus on swing states, as induced by the winner-take-all method, encourages candidates to campaign extensively and address the concerns of these states. This approach ensures that these states' voters are actively engaged and are granted a significant role in deciding the election. The attention given to these states results in the most thoughtful and informed voters making the final decision, creating a more democratic outlook.

In addition, the Electoral College restores a balance by granting adequate weight to large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as mandated by the Constitution, may disadvantage large states in terms of representation. However, the Electoral College compensates for this disparity by attracting more attention from presidential candidates to ensure the voices of citizens in large states are heard.

Finally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This feature ensures that the election process remains efficient, streamlined, and avoids unnecessary complications that arise from a lack of majority.

While some argue that a popular vote system may increase voter participation, it is crucial to recognize that voters in presidential elections generally have a desire to express their political preference rather than expect their vote to determine the outcome. The Electoral College still attracts significant voter turnout, with approximately half of the eligible American population participating in the 2012 election, proving that voters are motivated to engage in the political process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a crucial safeguard in our democratic system, providing fairness, stability, and balance in our presidential elections. It ensures that all states, regardless of size or population, have a voice. While acknowledging the claims for a popular vote system, the practical reasons in favor of retaining the Electoral College are strong and should be upheld.

I respectfully urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and to support its continuation. The preservation of this process is crucial to maintaining the principles upon which our great nation was founded.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your support on this matter.

Yours sincerely,

"Cities have come to the realization of how much pollution is being released into our air by motor vehicles. Many cities and countries are taking part in this attempt to clear the air, such as: Germany, Paris, Columbia, and the United States. Smog is hanging over many cities in a dull cloud, blocking the citizens lungs from receiving clean air but cities are starting to come to an understanding of how dirty our world is becoming.

In a small town with the population of 5,500, Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely ""carfree"", which does not include public transportation and certain roads meant for driving. If one wishes to own a car, they must purchase a car space with their home, costing a whopping 40,000.source:1paragraph:2 This automatically discourages homeowners to purchase a car because of the steep price. The attempt to rid the air of pollution is gradually becoming more and more successful. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own any motor vehicles, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to the small town. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves of this movement and is promoting car reduced communities. Although this is occurs in the suburbs, it is hoped to spread into the cities as well. source:1paragraph:9 Paris came to the smart decision of a driving ban once their air was replaced with a filthy smog. All motorists that owned license plates with evennumbers were required to leave their cars at home for the day, or they would be fined. The same rule would apply to any motorists with oddnumbered plates the next day. Evidently, it did not seem as if the people cared about the wellness of their planet, since 4,000 drivers were fined in a single day. 27 people were so furious with this law, their reactions cause them all to have their cars impounded.source:2paragraph:1012 The pollution was catastrophic enough to have Paris challenging China for the record of the most polluted city in the world. After one day of a carless city, the smog cleared enough to revoke the ban for oddnumbered plates the next day.

In an attempt for worldwide change, Bogota, Columbia creates a ""Day Without Cars"" in the capital city holding 7 million inhabitants. Many citizens partook in this act. They hoped to promote alternative transportation such as buses, biking, skating, hiking and walking to reduce pollution and have fresh air to breathe. Any violators were to be fined a fee of 25. source:3paragraph:2021 This campaign began in the 1990s and has resulted in the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the highest amount of alternative transportation in any Latin American city, according to the city mayor. source:3paragraph:27 Bogota has seemed to make the highest impact of cleaning out air pollution, and resulted in a more positive effect on every person's life.

The motivation of people trying to clean up the human act of pollution and waste is abundant and consistent throughout the entire world. We are changing the daily enjoyment of our lives, animals lives, and the cleaness of the earth one step at a time. A study last year showed that driving by young adults decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, which is a huge accomplishment on our part, compared to the earth's well being in the past 15 years. source:4paragraph:41 If we remain focused on the wellness of our planet and ourselves, the world can be a better place.",0
"  A Vision for Sustainable Urban Living  In an age marked by rapid urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal.

"Limiting car usage has many advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The passages provide evidence of this by highlighting examples of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days in different parts of the world. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more compact and accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain areas of the United States are caused by passenger cars. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The passages mention car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. This example shows that it is possible to live without cars and overall reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage also improves air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog highlights how congestion decreased by 60 percent and how the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Reducing the number of cars on the roads can significantly decrease air pollution, making cities healthier and more livable for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative forms of transportation. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia shows how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event encourages people to explore different modes of transportation and shows that it is possible to commute without a car. By promoting alternatives like walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce congestion, improve public health, and create more sustainable communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more compact and accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions how stores are placed within walking distance, on a main street, instead of in distant malls. This type of smart planning creates communities where residents can easily access necessary amenities without relying on cars. By designing communities that prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation, we can create more vibrant and livable neighborhoods that foster a sense of community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more compact and accessible communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of limiting car usage in different parts of the world. By adopting policies and planning practices that prioritize sustainable transportation options, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"Now, for some people, cars are a way of life. Nothing pleases them more than the feeling of a steering wheel on their hands, or the growl of a healthy engine. Those people probably could never live without their cars, but you probably can. Well, maybe not living without cars entirely, but at least reducing your use of them. It'll be a lot safer for the environment, and it'll cause a lot less traffic jams. So let's see why you can go a few more days without your prized Hoda Civic.

Now, you've probably had this fact jammed down your throat more times than you care to count, but, cars produce a lot of gas, which isn't really easy on the environment. According to the New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" And according to the Chicago Tribune article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter."" So, less car usage means less greenhouse emissions. Yes, there are cars out there that are more ""fuelefficient,"" but they still require lots of energy from the environment. Not only that, but using your car less often will mean that you won't have to deal with one of the biggest evils in the world.........traffic.

Now, think, when have you ever been stuck in traffic and actually enjoyed it? Now, if you were to ride a bicycle or take a subway, you wouldn't have to deal with that! Already, some cities around the world are finding alternative ways to avoid those jams. ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, tells of how the capital of Colombia is doing so. ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths...Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This means you'll be able to get to work or to that first date a lot quicker! Sure, people using less cars would strike a big blow in the automobile industry, but you don't neccesarily have to never drive a car again! What about on those long road trips, or when you have to carry a lot of passengers with you? A car would come in handy in such scenarios, but not neccesarily every scenario.

In summary, driving less would be more efficient because it means cleaner air and less highway congestion. So, after reading all of this information, do you think that you have what it takes to get from point A to point B without having to get into a driver's seat? can you take your hand off of the steering wheel long enough to open yourself up to other transportation options? Go ahead, try.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for society. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where efforts to reduce car dependency have resulted in improved quality of life, reduced pollution, and increased accessibility to transportation.

In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have made the bold decision to give up their cars. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and stress-free environment for the community members. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, explains how giving up her car has made her much happier. This sentiment is shared by many others who enjoy the verdant streets free from the noise and pollution of cars.

The trend of reducing car usage is not limited to Germany. In Paris, a partial driving ban was recently enforced to combat smog and reduce pollution. The ban applied to motorists with even-numbered and odd-numbered license plates on different days. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent. The success of this temporary ban suggests that limiting car usage can be an effective means of improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion in cities.

Similarly, in Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has been implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. During this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. The event has been successful in reducing traffic jams and creating a cleaner and quieter city for one day. The high turnout and participation in this event indicate the willingness of people to embrace alternative modes of transportation when given the opportunity.

The advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond personal well-being and environmental benefits. Reducing car dependence can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the case of Vauban, stores are located within walking distance on a main street, eliminating the need for large malls along distant highways. This not only promotes physical activity but also fosters a sense of community and social interaction. Additionally, the availability of public transportation becomes more crucial in car-reduced communities. Efforts are being made in the United States to increase the role of public transport in suburban areas, with the expectation that it will be given greater priority in future transportation bills.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the improved quality of life, reduced pollution, and increased accessibility to transportation that have been observed in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota. As urban planners and policymakers recognize the need for smart planning and alternative transportation options, the trend of reducing car dependency is expected to continue. This shift will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the wellbeing of the environment and the development of more sustainable communities.",1

Subject: Favorable Argument Regarding the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as a system for electing the President of the United States. While there has been a growing movement advocating for the popular vote to determine the winner, I believe that preserving the Electoral College is vital for a number of reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system implemented by most states allows for a landslide victory in electoral votes with even a slight plurality in a state. This prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, ensuring a clear winner in the election process.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to make the president accountable to all regions of the country. As Judge Posner noted, the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from being elected. This, in turn, prevents certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ensures that the president will represent the interests of all Americans. Without this requirement, candidates may focus their campaign efforts solely on heavily populated regions, ignoring the concerns of less populous areas.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to reach out to swing states, which are crucial in determining election outcomes. As Judge Posner explained, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign heavily in these toss-up states. This fosters increased voter engagement and allows for the most thoughtful voters to decide the election. By focusing on swing states, candidates must address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, leading to more comprehensive and representative policies.

Furthermore, the Electoral College preserves a balance of power, particularly for larger states. Since the composition of Congress already provides an advantage for less populous states, the Electoral College helps maintain equilibrium by granting larger states more attention during campaigns. As Judge Posner stated, a victory in a large state like Florida yields significantly more electoral votes compared to a small state like Wyoming. This reaffirms the importance of catering to the needs and wants of citizens living in larger states, ensuring their voices are heard in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the necessity for run-off elections. While rare, instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast can be problematic to resolve. The Electoral College provides a straightforward solution by invariably producing a clear winner. This prevents the complications and costs associated with conducting run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process carefully established by our founding fathers to balance the interests of all states and ensure a fair and representative presidential election. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, makes the president accountable to all regions, encourages candidates to engage with swing states, preserves a balance of power between large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I implore you to support the preservation of the Electoral College to uphold these fundamental principles.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College for the well-being of our democratic system.

Sincerely,

"Car Free Cities  Car-free cities, a concept gaining traction in contemporary urban planning, seek to transform the way we live, commute, and interact with our surroundings. These cities envision a future where private automobiles are either severely restricted or completely eliminated from urban landscapes, making room for alternative modes of transportation, green spaces, and sustainable living. In this essay, we will explore the various aspects of car-free cities, including their benefits, challenges, and potential solutions.  The idea of car-free cities stems from a growing awareness of the negative consequences of car-centric urban planning. Congestion, air pollution, and the diminishing quality of life in crowded, noisy, and car-infested streets have prompted urban planners to seek alternatives. Car-free cities offer several advantages:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of vehicles on the road, car-free cities significantly decrease air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This step towards environmental sustainability helps combat climate change and fosters cleaner, healthier urban environments.  Public Health: Fewer cars on the road mean fewer accidents and a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Additionally, the reduction in air pollution results in improved respiratory and cardiovascular health for city dwellers.  Efficient Space Utilization: Car-free cities optimize urban space usage. Parking lots and wide roads can be repurposed for parks, green spaces, and pedestrian zones, enhancing the overall quality of life.  Reduced Traffic Congestion: Less reliance on private cars leads to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and less stress for residents and commuters.  Cost Savings: Owning and maintaining a car can be expensive. Car-free cities allow residents to save money on vehicle purchase, fuel, and insurance, thereby improving their financial well-being.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents its own set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many people heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes. Transitioning to car-free living can face resistance from those who fear the loss of convenience and autonomy.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: Effective public transportation systems are critical for the success of car-free cities. Investments and improvements in public transit are necessary to provide convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that rely on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenue. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses during the transition is essential.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Redesigning urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and substantial investment in infrastructure, which can be a complex and lengthy process.  Solutions for the successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding public transportation, promoting active transportation, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities represent a promising vision for a more sustainable and healthy urban future. While challenges exist, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make it a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and involving the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities offer a promising vision of a more sustainable and vibrant urban environment.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This idea is being adopted in various parts of the world, as it is recognized that car usage is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. By reducing our reliance on cars and finding alternative means of transportation, we can mitigate the environmental impact and improve the quality of life in our communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of these emissions, accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. This is particularly important in the fight against climate change and global warming.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a serious problem, driving restrictions have been implemented to improve air quality. During a partial driving ban, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels started to clear. This demonstrates the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on air pollution and the health of citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative means of transportation. By creating car-free communities, like the one in Vauban, Germany, people are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead of relying on their cars. This not only reduces the reliance on fossil fuels but also encourages a more active and healthier lifestyle. Additionally, car-free communities often have stores and amenities within walking distance, reducing the need for long drives to access essential services.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, congestion is decreased, resulting in shorter commute times and improved efficiency. This, in turn, can positively impact productivity and economic growth. Furthermore, car ownership and maintenance can be costly, and reducing the reliance on cars can free up financial resources for other purposes.

In order to limit car usage effectively, it is important for governments and communities to invest in public transportation infrastructure. This includes expanding and improving public transportation systems, creating bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly roads, and implementing policies that incentivize the use of public transportation. By providing reliable and accessible alternatives to driving, people will be more inclined to leave their cars at home.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that should be considered. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and stimulate economic growth. It is vital that governments and communities take action to invest in alternative transportation methods and create car-free communities. By doing so, we can build a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"In today's society there is neverending controversy over a million things. surprisingly, a lot of these controversies are centered around one single topic: Politics. One of the most prominent arguments is the one surrounding the Electoral College and its possible abolishment. How the process works is when a state votes on their candidate the state is actually electing the Electors. Most states take a winnertakeall system where the majority of votes for a candidate would determine that all the electors will vote for that candidate. Only a few states split up to Electors based on votes, and then delegate a certain number of them to one candidate and a certain number of them to the other. The electors vary in amount by the number of members in its Congressional delegation. The Electoral College is made up of exactly 538 electors, and a majority of 270 is required to elect the president.

Personally, I would argue in favor of the Electoral College and keeping it for numerous reasons. One of them being that whomever is elected, will be everybody's president. What I mean by this is that no one region can overwhelm any other regions through popular vote and elect the candidate of their choice. If you took the southwest region of the United States, there would be California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, etc. Texas and California alone hold a great amount of America's population, and could possibly overwhelm the other states with popular vote and vote in the president of their choosing. With the Electoral College in place it allows to even the playing field and avoid runoff elections providing a more fair representation of the United States votes.

Another reason is that, the candidates can then be elected honestly, by people who listen thoughtfully. With the Electoral College, there are swing states. These states use the winnertakeallmethod, and are normally a toss up. Most competing candidates focus on these tossup states to try and secure the vote for them, and as some would argue, this prevents candidates from visiting smaller states, all because they want the most votes, but in truth, the candidates are visiting the swing states because they are thoughtful voters. The positive thing with swing states are that the voters within them, know they are a part of the deciding vote of the president. This means that they pay much closer attention to the election and things happening within it, and the candidates stances on many different topics. This allows voters in swing states to vote fairly and informatively, without over bearing politcal part bias.

On the other side of the argument are those who want to abolish the Electoral College. They pose many reasons for why they want this such as what is often called the disaster factor. This reason is based on the election of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. Bush, when Al Gore had recieved the majority of the individual votes but once taken to the Electoral College, Bush won with 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This incident angered many people, who wondered how and it brought up the question: Can electors defy the will of the people? The answer is yes, but it's high unlikely, and very rare, if ever. Electors are made of a parties committee, and sometimes the candidates themselves. They are picked by the State Legislature, so they obviously contain knowledge in politics and are trusted by the state government to do there duty as appointed. Some argue that the incident in 2000 between Gore and Bush was a freak accident. It's quite rare and, although it has been quite close before, no such incident had occured since 1888, when the Electoral College was created, or anytime after.

In Conclusion, in favor of the Electoral College staying as it is, it would keep the country voting fairly. It would also avoid runoff elections and a region overloading the popular vote, due to the vast quantity of population. Keeping the College intact would keep citizens in swing states interested during the election, becasue they know they are the deciding vote. While aruments against the Electoral College are many, they aren't substanial enough to completly abolish a process that has worked successfully for over a hundred years and counting.",0
"Dear Senator, I think you should get rid of the Electoral College and use popular vote instead. I think this because the Electoral College acts as one. The Electoral College also does not give every state a chance to see who they are voting for. And last, but not least its just confusing.

I think you should use popular vote instead of the Electoral College because the Electoral College votes as a whole. There is not just one person in a state, there are thousands, sometimes millions. Not every single person cast the same vote, not every single person has the same views. If the Electoral College was used than it votes as a unanimous vote, while there are different political parties within that state.

Another reason the Electoral College should not be used because it does not give evey state a fair chance. The Electoral College does not give every state a fair chance because the presidential candidates only visit the states with the larger amounts of electoral votes or the swing states. If a state doesn't have a large number of votes or isn't a swing state the candidates don't visit as said in source two. The smaller states don't see the candidates as much as the larger states because the electoral College makes it seem as though they can only have little if any impact on the outcome of the presidential race.

The final reason reason why the Electoral College should not be use dis because its just so confusing. The popular vote is a lot easier to understand than the Electoral College. Many people get confused during the election days because they do not understand the Electoral College. When they are voting they think they are voting for the President. The Electoral College doesn't mean that you are voting for the President you want, it just means that you're voting for the people who also want to vote for the same President as you.

In conclusion, Senator, these are the reasons why I think that we should use the popular vote instead of the Electoral College. First, the Electoral College votes as a whole instead of showing the a state's differences. Secondly, Presidentail candidates don't visit the states with a smaller amount of electoral votes. And lastly, the Electoral College is just confusing.",0

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College intact for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College provides several crucial benefits that outweigh the perceived disadvantages.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the Electoral College method reduces the likelihood of prolonged legal battles. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive result. This system avoids uncertainty and helps maintain stability in our democratic process.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As outlined in Judge Posner's article, no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This motivates candidates to campaign on a national scale, listening to the concerns and interests of citizens across the country. This approach ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs of all Americans, rather than being limited to regional interests.

Thirdly, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in swing states promotes engagement and participation in the political process. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, these swing states become the focus of campaign efforts, and voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the candidates and the issues. This system encourages thoughtful voting and ensures that the most engaged citizens have a significant role in deciding the outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance by granting more weight to larger states. As described by Judge Posner, the mal-apportionment of the Senate favors smaller states, and the Electoral College provides a mechanism to offset this disparity. This ensures that presidential candidates consider the concerns and needs of citizens in both large and small states, preventing any imbalance of representation.

Lastly, by maintaining the Electoral College, we avoid the complex logistics of run-off elections. Elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote can lead to run-off contests, which could further complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, minimizing any need for run-off elections and ensuring a smooth transition of power.

While there are critics who argue that the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College can lead to the disenfranchisement of voters in non-swing states, it is important to note that voter turnouts remain high, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. The Electoral College does not deter individuals from participating in the election; rather, it allows voters to express their political preferences and helps maintain the integrity of the process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, encourages national appeal, promotes engagement, restores balance, and avoids run-off elections. These benefits outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system. Let us continue to uphold the Electoral College as a vital component of our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I hope that you will take these factors into account when making decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, as people become more aware of the negative impact of cars on the environment. This practice is not only beneficial in addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also has a number of other advantages. By limiting car usage, communities can promote alternative transportation options, create more compact and accessible suburbs, and improve overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation options. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to use public transportation, walk, bike, or carpool. The use of public transportation, such as trams and buses, reduces the number of cars on the road, resulting in less congestion and improved air quality. Additionally, walking and biking are not only environmentally friendly, but they also promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles. By limiting car usage, communities can encourage the use of these alternative transportation options and improve the overall well-being of their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more compact and accessible suburbs. Traditionally, suburbs have been built around car use, with homes spread out and connected by highways. However, this model is unsustainable and contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, communities can adopt a new approach to suburban planning, with homes and stores placed within walking distance of each other and public transportation easily accessible. This not only reduces reliance on cars, but it also creates a more vibrant and interconnected community.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to improve overall quality of life. Cars are a major source of stress and tension for many people. By reducing car usage, individuals can experience reduced stress levels and an improved sense of well-being. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are not allowed on most streets, residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed. Furthermore, limiting car usage can also lead to quieter and safer neighborhoods, as the sound of bicycle bells and the chatter of pedestrians replace the noise of cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It promotes alternative transportation options, creates more compact and accessible suburbs, and improves overall quality of life. By reducing reliance on cars, we can address climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. It is important for individuals, communities, and governments to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies and practices that encourage more sustainable forms of transportation.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system rather than changing to a direct election by popular vote. In this letter, I will present my reasons for this stance, addressing counterclaims and using evidence from multiple sources.

One of the main reasons I support the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to disputes over the popular vote. The winner's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, which leads to a more decisive victory. This not only provides a sense of certainty and legitimacy to the outcome, but also minimizes the risk of prolonged post-election disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. This requirement prevents candidates from focusing solely on certain regions and encourages them to campaign across the country. This is crucial for a successful president as it helps to avoid regional disenfranchisement and ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, regardless of the region they reside in.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to allocate attention and resources to swing states. As Judge Posner notes, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to focus on these toss-up states. This results in more informed and engaged voters in these states, who are likely to be more thoughtful in their decision making. It also prevents candidates from ignoring certain states where they would have no chance of winning, as they know that every state contributes to their electoral vote count.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. Judge Posner rightly points out that this system restores some balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the voices and concerns of both big and small states are heard and considered during the campaign, which would not be the case in a solely popular vote system.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a winner is declared, as pointed out by Judge Posner. This eliminates the need for additional elections, which could complicate the electoral process and potentially lead to greater uncertainty.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall voter turnout in presidential elections suggests that this concern is not substantial. As Bradford Plumer notes, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their individual vote may not swing the entire election. Voters participate to express their political preferences and engage in the democratic process, even if their state's outcome seems certain.

In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College system is essential for maintaining certainty, ensuring trans-regional appeal, focusing on swing states, balancing the political weight of states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. Despite some criticisms and calls for change, the Electoral College remains a valuable component of our democracy as established by the founding fathers. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals related to the electoral process in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving the interests of our state and our country.

Sincerely,

"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in a number of cities and suburbs around the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative forms of transportation. By limiting car usage and making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, there are several advantages that can be gained.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, both in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in car-intensive areas, we can help to drastically reduce these emissions. This is an important step in combating climate change and improving air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. When cars are restricted, people are more likely to use alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking public transportation. This increase in physical activity can have numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of obesity. Additionally, walking and biking can help to reduce traffic congestion and improve overall traffic flow.

Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. By reducing dependence on cars, cities and suburbs can allocate less space for parking and more space for other purposes, such as parks, playgrounds, and businesses. This can help to revitalize neighborhoods and promote economic development. Additionally, by promoting alternative forms of transportation, cities can save money on road maintenance and construction.

The success of limiting car usage can be seen in various examples around the world. In Vauban, a suburb in Germany, car ownership is allowed but restricted, with limited parking spaces available. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This has created a car-free community where residents can enjoy a quieter and more peaceful environment. Similar initiatives have been implemented in other cities, such as Paris and Bogota, which have seen a decrease in congestion and pollution during car-free days.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in cities and suburbs has several advantages. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promotes healthier lifestyles, and has economic benefits. By adopting smart planning strategies, we can create more sustainable and livable communities for future generations. It is important for citizens to support and advocate for these initiatives in order to achieve positive change.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals and communities. This is a growing trend in many parts of the world, including Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can improve the environment, promote alternative transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and create healthier and more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also help reduce air pollution. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer highlights the impact of car-free days in Paris. After days of intense smog, the city enforced a partial driving ban, which resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a decrease in air pollution. This shows that by limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier living conditions for residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. As mentioned in the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leading to streets devoid of traffic jams. By promoting alternative transportation and reducing the number of cars on the road, we can alleviate congestion and create more efficient and accessible transportation systems.

Limiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is mentioned that car ownership rates have been decreasing in the United States. This shift in behavior can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as well as reduce the dependence on the car industry. Additionally, by promoting alternative transportation methods, such as biking and walking, we can create more vibrant and economically flourishing communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" provides an example of Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and have a more enjoyable and stress-free lifestyle.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can improve the environment, promote alternative transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. The examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States show that this trend is gaining popularity and can have a positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole. It is important for us to consider these advantages and work towards reducing car usage for a better and greener future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage in cities and suburbs can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. The passages provided discuss the benefits of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days in different parts of the world. These examples demonstrate that reducing reliance on cars can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more connected and accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. The passage about the car-free community of Vauban, Germany, states that cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transit, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, the passage about the driving ban in Paris mentions that congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent and smog levels dropped after the ban was enforced. This shows that limiting car usage can have an immediate and tangible impact on air quality.

In addition to improving the environment, limiting car usage also has several benefits for individuals. The Vauban community in Germany reported that 70 percent of families do not own cars and many residents sold their cars to move there. The residents expressed that they felt happier and less stressed without owning cars. This suggests that reducing car usage can lead to improved mental well-being and decreased stress levels. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, also highlights the positive response from participants, who described the event as an opportunity to reduce stress and lower air pollution.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can create more connected and accessible communities. The Vauban community placed stores within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This encourages residents to walk or bike to complete their daily errands, fostering a sense of community and improving accessibility for all residents. The passage about Bogota’s car-free day also describes how the event promotes alternative transportation and reduces traffic congestion, leading to more efficient and enjoyable travel experiences for everyone involved.

Overall, reducing car usage has several advantages for individuals and the environment. It improves air quality, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, promotes healthier lifestyles, and creates more connected and accessible communities. By adopting the models set by communities like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, cities and suburbs around the world can work towards a future with less reliance on cars and a greater focus on sustainable and efficient transportation options.",1
"Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to our society, ranging from tackling issues like greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and creating more sustainable communities. The success stories of car-free neighborhoods and cities around the world show that it is possible to live without cars and still maintain a high quality of life. By adopting smarter urban planning, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and changing cultural perceptions about car ownership, we can create a future where cars are no longer the sole means of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars contribute to about 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car dependency, we can make a significant impact on reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help combat air pollution, which is a major concern in many cities around the world. In her article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" Robert Duffer discusses how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to tackle high pollution levels. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and highlighted the role cars play in polluting our environment. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier cities for everyone.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve public health. Andrew Selsky's article ""Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" shows how the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, has promoted alternative transportation and encouraged people to adopt healthier habits like hiking, biking, and skating. By making our cities more walkable and accessible to public transportation, we can encourage physical activity and reduce the risk of sedentary lifestyles and related health issues.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. In her article ""The End of Car Culture,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses how Americans are driving less and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift, coupled with smarter urban planning and the development of alternative transportation options, can lead to the creation of vibrant communities with improved access to amenities, reduced traffic congestion, and less reliance on fossil fuels.

While some may view limiting car usage as an inconvenience, the success stories from car-free neighborhoods and cities around the world show that it is possible to live without cars and still enjoy a high quality of life. By adopting a comprehensive approach that includes smarter urban planning, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and changing cultural perceptions about car ownership, we can create a future where cars are no longer the only means of getting around. The advantages of limiting car usage, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving public health and creating sustainable communities, make it a worthwhile endeavor for the betterment of our society and the planet.",1
"Dear Senator, I think the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the United States of America. The Electoral collage resembles too much control by the United States government. As said in Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This dosnt even sound right does it... This is one example of United States government trying to rail the presidential elections, and i can asure you that this is not the first time this has been attempted by the government. The U.S Constitution declares that citizens of United States of America have the right to vote. What this looks like is the government trying to vote for us. Another thing that i do not get about the Electoral Collage is why are we voting for the elector instead of just towards the president. I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that heshe is opinionated towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. In source 3, It tries to tell you all the possitive things about the Electoral Collage... The possitive things they mention about the Electoral Collage are small compared to the issues with it. The Electoral Collage is outdated and needs to be taken off. It is just unfair now.

"Limiting car usage is the last thing people would see as an advantage to society. This dramatic change has been a eye opener to many communities in different countries all over the world. It has really helped with the environment and brought a positive impact on communities in various ways.

To begin, the limiting of car usage has brought out a positive result in the environment. According to the excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Due to the partial driving ban, the smog was able to be cleared sooner than later. Some may claim an argument of cars being very useful and it helps get from destination to destination in a reasonable amount of time. Although that may be reasonable, a testimony from a businessman in Bogota explains that it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

To continue on, the limiting of car usage has also brought a positive impact many communities in different countries. This new adjustment has created a domino effect as many countries take on the challenge. In the excerpt from ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", author Andrew Selsky explains that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. Not only is it catching the eye of the people of the community, but also by other countries. According to the excerpt, Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"". This advantage could be the change of a lifetime for many communities. And it might be just the thing they need.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has brought many advantages in society. It has had a positive impact on the environment and communities. Dont just dwell one little con that can be outweighted by all the pros this new advantage may bring.",0
"Can you imagine not using a car when you go anywhere, not even up the road to the grocery store? Some people can't imagine living without cars, whereas some people already have made the transition, or are beginning to make the transition. Limiting car usage can cause people to be happier, have less stress, and can cause less pollution in the atmosphere for a healthier environment.

Limiting car usage has been found to eliminate some of the stress people are having everyday. Cars are another liability that put stress on people everyday. What are you going to do if you get into a car accident, your car breaks down, or there is an overwhelming amount amount of traffic that causes you to be late to a big meeting. Without cars, people dont have that burden on their shoulders to carry around. In Vauban, Germany ""70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two."" Source 1 P3.

Vauban is the beginning of what could be a worldwide transition that could help save the world.

Saving the world may sound ridiculous when it comes to limiting the use of cars, but it's not. Cars are one of the leading causes in pollution and greenhouse gasses and have a large effect on the atmosphere. Cars influence the effect of global warming. In Paris, the smog reached a near record high and the city had to limit the use of cars for a period of time until the smog levels decreased. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels, and 79.7 in London, Reuters found"" source 2 P17.

Without the cars, the smog levels decreased and caused a healthier environment for the time being. With limited use of cars, the air that we breathe everyday will be healthier, and the environment will begin to recover decreasing the levels of global warming, which could eventually severely hurt the planet if it continues.

The need for owning a car has gone down in recent years, according to a study at the University of Michigan. In large cities, people are living without cars just as easily as people that do have cars becuase of public transportation, and just walking places. In both the USA and Colombia, people have shown that the need for cars is miniscule when you have other forms of transportation. In Colombia, the city of Bogota had its third consecutive ""car free day"" which happens once a year. The people of Bogota surprisingly enjoy it. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work"" source 3 P20.

This is an opportunity to do many things for the people that live there which include taking away stress, causing happiness, and even getting a little exercise in that they might not get everyday. All in all, limiting the use of cars has proven to be effective everywhere it was tested.

Without cars, people may say the world would be a different place, and they're right when they say that. Who's to say it wouldnt be a better place? All over the world, cities are limiting the use of cars and the effect has been surprisingly positive. People are saying they feel less stressed, they feel happier, and the enivornment is happier too with less pollution.",0

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my stance on the issue of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping the current system or changing to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in the texts, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process, and I will outline several key reasons to support my claim.

Firstly, it is important to understand the purpose and functioning of the Electoral College. As described by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between congressional selection and a popular vote. This process involves the selection of electors, their vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College ensures that each state has a voice and representation in the presidential election, preventing a scenario where candidates focus solely on densely populated areas and neglect the interests of smaller states.

It is notable that the Electoral College encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters and regions, as mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner. With the winner-take-all method in most states, candidates are incentivized to campaign in swing states, which ultimately leads to a campaign that addresses the concerns and issues of a diverse group of Americans. This promotes a more inclusive and representative democracy, as each region's interests receive attention. Without the Electoral College, candidates would concentrate their efforts on highly populated areas, potentially ignoring the concerns of citizens outside of these regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the presidential candidate has national appeal, serving as a protector against regional favoritism. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that regional candidates are unlikely to be successful presidents, as they may not adequately represent the interests of citizens in other regions. The Electoral College encourages candidates to build a broad support base across the country and increases the chances of electing a president who can effectively govern for the entire nation.

Another critical benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to provide a certainty of outcome. Although disputed outcomes are possible, they are less likely compared to a popular vote system. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate. A tie in the electoral vote is highly unlikely and does not pose a significant risk. This stability and predictability in election outcomes are essential for maintaining the public's trust in the democratic process.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps balance the political power between large and small states. Judge Richard A. Posner points out that the Electoral College gives more weight to large states in the political landscape, compensating for the mal-apportionment of Senate representation. This mechanism ensures that candidates address the concerns and interests of all states, preventing a situation where the outcome of elections is entirely determined by a few highly populated states.

In conclusion, after considering the information from the provided texts, I believe that keeping the Electoral College or changing to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States is necessary to protect our democracy. The Electoral College promotes national appeal, prevents regional favoritism, encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens in all states, and provides certainty of election outcomes. It strikes a balance between large and small states, ensuring that each state has a voice in determining the President. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuity of the Electoral College or consider alternative methods that maintain these crucial principles.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments I have presented. I am available to discuss this further and provide any additional information that will assist you in making an informed decision.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in the selection of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in the texts, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College for several key reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and electing the President through a popular vote. It ensures that both the states and the citizens have a say in the selection process. As stated in the text by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. This system ensures that candidates must appeal to a broad range of states and regions rather than solely relying on dense population centers.

One of the benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory even with a slight plurality in a single state. This certainty of outcome is crucial in preventing disputes over the popular vote count and ensuring a smooth transition of power.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters the concept of ""everyone's president."" As Judge Posner states, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, thus requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign across the country and consider the interests of all regions. It helps prevent the feeling of disenfranchisement among citizens from states that have lower populations or less political influence.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus on swing states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Swing states often hold the decisive votes in elections and receive greater attention from candidates. This gives voters in these states the opportunity to make informed decisions, as they are more likely to receive extensive campaigning and information from the candidates. The electoral system incentivizes candidates to engage with voters in all states, ensuring a more balanced representation of the nation's interests.

The Electoral College also addresses the issue of large states potentially dominating the election process. As Judge Posner argues, the Electoral College balances the political weight between large and small states. The popular vote in large states like Florida would have a significant impact on the outcome, while smaller states like Wyoming still maintain their influence. This balance helps prevent marginalization and allows for the inclusion of diverse perspectives in the presidential election.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which occur when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity and potential for confusion in the election process. The Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, minimizing the need for additional rounds of voting and maintaining the efficiency and stability of the electoral system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves as a necessary compromise that upholds the principles of fairness, regional representation, and certainty of outcome. It prevents the domination of densely populated areas, encourages trans-regional appeal, and balances the interests of large and small states. While not perfect, it has proven to be an effective system for over two centuries. I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating any proposed changes to our presidential election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Many cities and countries are starting a new trend that is not using cars at all. Vehicles can cause many problems such as air pollution, congested roads, and injuries due to wrecks. Some cities have started some type of way to promote how bad vehicles really are and advising people on what to do to stop driving.

For three years in Bogota, columbia, the city has a day called, ""Day Without Cars"" where in this city, home of seven million citizens, nobody can use a vehicle unless they are willing to pay a 25 fee if they were get caught. Columbians greatly support this cause by hiking, biking, skating, and taking the bus to work. This caused the roads to be clear and not congested like they usually are.

Paris has a system to help support limiting car use as well. They take even and odd numbered license plates and designate a day that's either even or odd. On the even day, car owners that have an even license plate are ordered to leave their car at home, and vice versa for odd. If they have drive their car on the day they were ordered to leave it home, they have to pay a fee of 31.

The United States has reached a point to where cars are starting to become unpopular. In 2005, the amount of miles driven peaked, and in April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was down approximately 9% below the peak in 2005. That is equal to where the U.S. was in 1995.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that some companies that are in the computercell phone business are making more money. In the United States, many people are using the computer and telephone to communicate with people because it's faster and easier to access than having to drive around town to meet with someone. This means that computer websites are making more money and the phone companies are making more money since people are using their phones more often.

Next, cars can cause major stress to some people. Traffic jams, animals running across the road, not being able to see due to smog, and car accidents stress people out because they are either too busy to deal with it or being scared that they might hurt someonesomething or may even get hurt themselves. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter in an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

Also people's health could improve tremendously as a result of limiting car usage. Walking to work could burn the calories that people ate at breakfast. Hiking, running, skating, and biking to meet up for lunch or for little kids to go to the play ground could greatly increase people's health. Since people would be technically exercising while going to places, they would be more proned to drinking water to rehydrate themselves which would make them a healthier person in the process as well.

The process of limiting car usage has started or has already taken over cities and countries. It can reduce stress, increase the health of people, and increase the profit for business. The advantages of limiting car usage may seem small, but in the end they will have a huge impact on societies.",0
"The modern car is a major travel source in which millions of people rely on daily. The issue with this is the struggle of being stopped at lights or being in a traffic jam. The quintessential point here is that greenhouse gases will be lowered in mass amounts if we limit our car usage. Varying countries are supportive of having car free environmentsareas. Some being Germany, France, Columbia, and the U.S.

Elisabeth Rosenthal describes a community in Germany. Each owner of a house in the neighborhood is allowed to own a car but has to pay a fee of 40,000 to receive a spot. In this neighborhood of Vauban, there is no need for a car because stores are located next to the neighborhood which is ""Placed a walk away"" and is very efficient. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse emissions in Europe..."" Vauban is in an attempt to lower these numbers because the thought of owning a car here is ""frowned upon"" because all essential stores are in walking distance.

The city of Paris was suffering from a smog epidemic and had to enforce a no driving ban. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The French people that were usually driving were not here, so roads and major highways freed up which allows for more free room. The smog also was depleting due to a decrease of car usage.

Columbia is using a yearly plan for a carfree day which brings open streets to the city of Bogota. The advantage of this limited car usage is the promotion of alternate transportation and reduction of smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source three. When it comes to mind, driving can make a day more stressful which hinders work performance. The outstanding responses from this event brought ""Two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar..."" into the event. ""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city..."" The community of Bogota took a chance to bring their lives closer by incorporating new businesses into a walkable distance from neighborhoods.

According to research, ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by..."" this also provides less Greenhouse gas effects on the environment. A main factor in reducing traffic jamsgreenhouse gases is the new plans that bring hope to those who are skeptical about switching over to carfree. ""New york's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls..."" Biking is an excellent alternative to driving because it is fast and efficient. Another plan was provided by the Moblie World Congress, ""Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical..."" As stated, big motor vehicle companies are trying to reduce the practicality of owning a car as soociety turns its head towards a carfree environment.

Cars are a very fast port of transportation but carry a burden of bad factors. Pollution has increased over the times in which cars have been overused and is the leading cause for an increase in Greenhouse gases. If we limit our car usage, we can create an almost free pollution zone and free up much needed space for other activites than miles upon miles of driving roads.",0
"A life without cars sure sounds like a great idea for saving up less pollution and have less traffic jams, right? Well, that's a true fact, facing the reality that over the past few years we've had times and times again where we've polluted our own air over the repetitive over use of cars, specially because nowadays there's way more cars being sold from car dealerships like Ford, Mercedes, chevrolet, and etc. On the contrary, there's now been a few areas and cities in a few countries where there's been a shortage of using cars or none used at all. A life without cars can indeed help out so much more in many various occasions and issues like pollution, smog, and traffic.

Carfree cities are the best ways to improve in somewhat of a way for easier transportation and reduced air pollution. For example, as said from source 1, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, on the first paragraph, ""VAUBAN, GermanyResidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up on cars."" explains how this residence from the few in Germany have made it possible to be carfree. To add more, the author, Rosenthal, from this passage also explains that Vauban contains 5,500 residents making it the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life, in lines 47, paragraph 6. The main idea of this is that it's best to keeps cities, or even better whole countries carfree or low ratings of cars being used to help stop such as pollution and traffic jams.

Just like Vauban, Germany is carfree some other countries do their best as well to keep their cities and border safe from the damages and difficulties cars cause. As an example of this, source 2, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, explains in paragraph 10, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" As this clearly states, Paris has as well moved towards a much closer carfree city itself. Reason for this partial driving ban is because of smog caused by the pollution of cars, this explained on paragraph 17 on source 2 as the author, Duffer, says, ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" In comparison, soruce 3, ""CarFree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, explains how Bogota, Colombia in has a carfree day for devoiding traffic jams. As a few perks that were gained from this carfree day, in paragraph 28, said are: ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.",0
"  Pioneering Sustainable Urban Living  In an era marked by rapid urbanization, car-free cities have emerged as a visionary solution to the many challenges that densely populated urban areas face. The concept of car-free cities envisions a future where private automobiles are either restricted or entirely absent, making way for sustainable transportation alternatives and green, people-centered urban spaces. This essay delves into the idea of car-free cities, exploring their potential benefits, challenges, and solutions.  Car-free cities are a response to the urgent need for sustainable urban living:  Environmental Sustainability: The reduced use of cars significantly lowers air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a healthier planet. These cities serve as beacons of environmental responsibility in an era where climate change is a pressing concern.  Public Health: Car-free cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, resulting in fewer accidents and better health outcomes. Decreased air pollution levels lead to improved respiratory and cardiovascular health among residents.  Optimal Space Utilization: These cities make efficient use of urban space by repurposing parking lots and roads into parks, green spaces, and pedestrian zones. The urban landscape is transformed into an inviting and vibrant place to live.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is greatly reduced, resulting in shorter commutes and less stress for city dwellers.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a costly endeavor. By reducing their reliance on private vehicles, residents in car-free cities have the opportunity to save money on vehicle-related expenses, improving their overall financial stability.  However, the transition to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals depend heavily on their cars for daily routines and commutes, and the transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear the loss of convenience and personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: Effective public transportation systems are crucial for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are needed to expand and enhance public transit options, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses relying on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a critical aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The redesign of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions to successfully implement car-free cities include the expansion and improvement of public transportation, the promotion of active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, the encouragement of carpooling and ride-sharing, the adoption of electric and sustainable transportation, and a focus on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a glimpse into a more sustainable and vibrant urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and involving the public in the planning process, cities can work towards a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent an inspiring vision of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still necessary? Or even fair? With advancing technology and better processes, the old ways of doing things must be questioned.

Almost all states have a winnertakeall system in place, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This system has many faults and in some cases can produce false results. A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, heshe will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electoral votes, making the system somewhat corrupt.

Not only is the process of the Electoral College unfair, it is simply not necessary, with most voters using digital machines to enter their vote for candidate, votes can be counted digitally and accurately. The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology makes the very idea of the electoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system.

Not only should we use a system using computers to count votes, but we already do, news broadcasters show which presidential candidate is winning in real time using modern technology. This allows us to know which candidate has won the election on voting day. Keep in mind that when the electoral college was made, many citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediately is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnessessary. And what if there is a tie in the electoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress.

Times have changed. Technology has improved. With this the very building blocks of our government must be improved and updated.",0

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and argue in favor of retaining this system of electing the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the information from various sources, including the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner's article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" in order to form my argument.

Firstly, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. It serves as a crucial process that provides fair representation for both large and small states. Each state is allotted a number of electors based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring that every state has a voice in the election of the President. This prevents larger states from monopolizing the decision-making process and ensures that candidates must have broad national appeal to be successful, as outlined by Judge Posner in his article.

Additionally, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome. Despite concerns raised by critics, disputes over the electoral vote are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system used by most states further reinforces this certainty, as a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory for the respective candidate. This system minimizes the potential for electoral ties and ensures that the final outcome is clear and undisputed.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, ensuring that the interests of diverse regions and their voters are represented. As Judge Posner argues, a presidential candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The focus on swing states prompts candidates to engage with a broader range of voters and address their concerns, making the campaign process more meaningful and representative.

In addition, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. This is especially significant considering the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as Judge Posner explains. By awarding electors based on state populations, larger states receive more attention and influence from presidential candidates. Therefore, the Electoral College serves as an important mechanism for ensuring that the interests of both large and small states are considered during the election.

Lastly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected with a clear majority of electoral votes, avoiding complicated run-off elections. Without the Electoral College, the possibility of a candidate winning with a mere plurality of the popular vote increases, which could lead to the necessity for extended election processes. This could potentially create confusion and political instability, as seen in the past. The Electoral College streamlines the process and guarantees a definitive outcome.

While critics may argue that the Electoral College undermines the importance of individual votes, it is vital to recognize that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences, not solely with the expectation of influencing the overall outcome. The knowledge that their votes contribute to the selection of electors provides voters with a sense of participation and representation within the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system and should be retained. It ensures fair representation for all states, provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal in candidates, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While criticisms of the Electoral College exist, it is a practical system that upholds the principles of our Constitution.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my viewpoint. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the information provided and take into account the long-standing benefits and practical reasons for keeping the Electoral College intact.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. As demonstrated in various passages, reducing car dependency can lead to benefits such as improved public health, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in public health. The passage on the car-free community in Vauban, Germany, highlights the positive impact of reducing car ownership on residents' well-being. According to the passage, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of them sold a car to move into the community. This shift away from car dependency has resulted in increased happiness and reduced stress among residents. Heidrun Walter, a resident, states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This suggests that reducing car usage can contribute to a less stressful and more relaxed lifestyle.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. As stated in the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas of the United States. The passage also discusses the efforts being made in countries like the United States to promote ""car reduced"" communities and prioritize public transportation. By transitioning to more sustainable modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, individuals can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to the development of more sustainable and livable communities. The passage on the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, highlights the positive impact of reducing car usage on traffic congestion and air quality. During the car-free day, which is an annual event in Bogota, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This resulted in an eerily traffic-free city with significantly reduced congestion. The passage also mentions the long-term improvements made in Bogota's infrastructure, such as the construction of miles of bicycle paths, new parks and sports centers, and improved sidewalks. These changes have transformed the city, making it more accessible, walkable, and enjoyable for its residents.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including improved public health, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and the development of more sustainable and livable communities. By transitioning to alternative modes of transportation and promoting car-reduced communities, individuals can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future for themselves and future generations.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various parts of the world. Encouragingly, this movement is gaining momentum as societies become more conscious of the negative impacts of excessive car dependency. The advantages of reducing car usage are numerous and span across environmental, social, and economic factors. By restricting car ownership and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, and walking, communities can reap the benefits of smarter planning and a more sustainable future.

Body Paragraph One: Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Limiting car usage is crucial in the fight against climate change. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. In Europe, they contribute to 12 percent of emissions, rising to as high as 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing reliance on automobiles, we can significantly decrease the carbon footprint associated with transportation. This is especially important as countries strive to meet emission reduction targets and transition towards a more sustainable future.

Body Paragraph Two: Enhancing Urban and Suburban Planning
Restricting car usage allows for more efficient and sustainable urban and suburban planning. Suburban communities like Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia have already implemented car-free zones or days, demonstrating the benefits of this approach. In these neighborhoods, streets are designed with pedestrians and cyclists in mind, with homes, shops, and amenities located within walking or cycling distance. This approach promotes exercise, reduces traffic congestion, and enhances community interaction. By prioritizing public transportation and infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, cities and suburbs can create more livable and accessible spaces for their residents.

Body Paragraph Three: Economic Considerations
Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. A reduction in car ownership and usage leads to decreased demand for fuel and automobile-related expenses. Families can save money by utilizing alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or cycling. Moreover, the reallocation of resources from building and maintaining roads and parking spaces can be redirected towards other pressing needs, such as improving public transportation networks or investing in renewable energy infrastructure. Overall, limiting car usage can create economic opportunities and alleviate financial burdens for individuals and communities.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are multifaceted and have far-reaching implications for our environment, society, and economy. By implementing smart planning strategies, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, foster healthier and more livable neighborhoods, and stimulate economic growth. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Bogota in Colombia, and other cities around the world demonstrate that it is possible to create sustainable and car-free environments. As we strive for a more sustainable future, it is imperative that we continue to prioritize alternative forms of transportation and explore innovative ways to transform our communities into car-reduced or even car-free spaces.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my perspective on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and to argue why I believe it should be maintained or changed to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. In making my case, I have considered multiple perspectives from various sources, including the texts provided.

One of the key aspects of the Electoral College that I find admirable is its ability to ensure a certainty of outcome. As highlighted in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, while disputes over the Electoral College vote have occurred, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. Additionally, the winner-take-all method employed in most states contributes to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Though a nationwide electoral tie is possible, it is highly unlikely, minimizing the potential for prolonged election disputes.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner notes, no region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to independently elect a president. Therefore, candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions, preventing a candidate with only regional support from being elected. This requirement ensures that the president represents the diverse interests of citizens from various parts of the country.

One of the Electoral College's most significant advantages lies in its impact on swing states. This point is highlighted in Judge Posner's article, where he argues that the winner-take-all method encourages candidates to focus on these critical states. This, in turn, leads to greater voter attention and engagement in these states, as their votes hold more significance in deciding the outcome of the election. The thoughtful voters in swing states, who receive the most campaign attention, are then able to make an informed decision and have a greater say in determining the future of the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College serves to restore balance to the influence of large states versus small states, as pointed out in Judge Posner's article. The mal-apportionment of the Senate can result in smaller states having limited political weight. However, with the Electoral College, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the higher number of electoral votes they possess. This ensures that the concerns and issues of citizens in both small and large states are taken into account during the campaign.

While there are valid arguments in favor of maintaining the Electoral College, I also acknowledge the concerns raised by those advocating for a change to election by popular vote. The shortcomings and potential flaws of the Electoral College system, as articulated by Bradford Plumer, should not be dismissed. The system can be perceived as unfair to voters if their state employs a winner-take-all approach, leading candidates to focus primarily on swing states. In doing so, candidates may neglect states where the outcome is already predetermined, resulting in a possible disenfranchisement of voters.

In conclusion, it is essential to carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College when deciding on its future. While the system provides certainty of outcome, encourages broad voter appeal, and gives weight to swing states and small states, it may also fail to fully represent all voters' interests.

As your constituent, I implore you to thoroughly assess these arguments and make an informed decision that aligns with the best interests of our democracy. Whether it involves maintaining the Electoral College or exploring alternative methods, it is crucial that we address the existing concerns and work towards a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"""Life goes on without cars.""Rosenthal.There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Two advantages to limiting car usage is it reducees smog and it helps with greenhouse gas emission.

To start of with limiting car usage helps with the reducetion of smog. To illustrate,in the text ""Paris bans driving due to smog""Duffer the city of Paris decides to put a ban on driving:""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31.The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day.""Duffer 10. This ban was put to good use by some but others still did not follow with the ban about 4,000 people were fined. People will still find away to break a ban or regulation that is put out. This just shows how many motorists are actually out on the streets of Paris but still a good number of people went through with the ban. Many people did participate inthis ban,it helps reducee the smog that is desperately needed in this city. To further illustrate , in the text ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hot in Bogota."" Selsky. Bogota, Columbia decides to put into place a carfree day to ""reducee smog. Violators faced 25 fines.""Selsky 21. Also like the ban in Paris this ban was put out to help with the cities problem with smog. In a capital city of over 7 million and people trying to get to work and on with there day of course there would be a problem with smog. The smog can cause many problems with the environment and health of the people in that community,especially in a city with a hot climate like Colombia. Also two other cities joined in this car free day: Cali and Valledupar. In both of these stories the ban limit on the usage of cars is for the one problem that many big cities face like Paris, booga , Beijing and many more:smog.

To continue , limiting car usage also helps with greenhouse gas emission. For example, in the text ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""Rosenthal one of the reasons that Vauban, Germany decided to become a carfree suburb "" is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission from tailpipe...""Rosenthal 5. ""Passenger Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe""Rosenthal 5 by having this city in Germany go carfree its going to help that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisssion go down. Also, with that many cars in Vauban the environment is healthier which makes the people in that city healthier more stress free. Another example is in the text "" the End of Car Culture.""Rosenthal. With less Americans buying cars and driving less "" President Obamas ambitious goals to curb the greenhouse gas emission""Rosenthal 29 is beginning to happen. The greenhouse gas emission will be reaching a decline with the miles that people are driving going down. If the driving rates continue to go down and Obamas goal to reducee the greenhouse gas emission in the U.S. will go down and the country would not be responsible for up to 50 percent greenhouse gas emission in some parts of heavily populated car areas in the United States. Limiting the usage of cars can help with greenhouse gas emission.

In conclusion, There are many advantages to limiting the usage of cars. Two advantages to limiting the usage of cars is it reducees smog and it helps with greenhouse gas emission. Having a limit on car usage helps with the well being a the community.",0
"In today's society, when people are asked if they would give up their cars, they would be shocked. No would be the most common answer. However, the advantages of limiting car usage are great. General stress decreases, and pollution to the environment also decreases. People are not only helping themselves, but also helping the ecosystem.

Stress. Everyone has it but what if it could be decreased just by using personal transportation less? In Germany, there are certain communities that ban car usage. No cars are allowed inside the city. Street parking, driveways, and home garages have become obsolete. One citizen of one of the towns said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" . The anxiety one gets when driving a car is almost unreal. Most kids 16 and up now just do not get their licenses just because the thought of driving scares them. Citizens of cities that have just one day where cares are prohibited, such as Bogota, Colombia, love that singular day out of the year. Most say its a good opportunity to increase mental health Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . Stress not only is awful for mental health, but also physical. 75% of those who have high levels of anxiety, or are exposed to it, are tired all the time, often feel weak, or sometimes may even cause heart issues. The number one reason people have stress is by driving. So using cars less is the best way to decrease stress, and promote good mental health.

Most people that read or watch the news know that the environment is hurt, and that the human population is at fault. How? Excess usage of motor vehicles. As stated in In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States. These statistics are horrible. Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of nearrecord pollution rates Not only was nature being hurt, but the population of France. Breathing in smog is unnatural. theman body can not take that many pollutants, and so it tries to fix itself. In doing this, lung cancer rates rise, pneumonia rates rise, diseases in general become more abundant. Paris took action. When enforcing the driving ban, congestion was down 60% in just five days. The only partial solution to this rising amount of smog is to decrease driving rates, and to use deisel gas less. I hate this test so much why am I even writing this I feel like a robot just going through the motions and its your fault. I blame you.

Rome was not built in a day, so getting state legislatiors or even government officials to agree on a partial driving rule may take a while. However, citizens can spread the word of the evils of driving. You, dear reader, can fix this problem. Try carpooling to work, riding your bike to places near you instead of driving. Do what you can to reduce pollution and stress. Influence your friends and family to do the same. Together, we can rase awareness of the evils of driving. Together, we can rule the world.",0

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved for several important reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As demonstrated in the 2000 election, a dispute over the popular vote can lead to prolonged legal battles and uncertainty. However, the electoral vote invariably exceeds the popular vote share of the winning candidate, reducing the likelihood of such disputes. This system provides stability and confidence in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is representative of the entire country and not just certain regions. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This is crucial for ensuring that the president can effectively govern all regions and address the concerns of diverse populations. Without the Electoral College, there is a risk of candidates appealing only to certain regions, which could lead to a lack of representation for others.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in each state encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in swing states receive more attention from candidates and are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. These voters tend to be more thoughtful and informed, making them ideal decision-makers for the election. The Electoral College incentivizes candidates to engage with a broader range of voters and prioritize their concerns.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, where each state has two senators regardless of population, already gives small states more weight in the political process. The Electoral College further enhances this balance by allotting electoral votes based on a state's population. This prevents large states from overpowering smaller states and helps ensure that the interests of both are considered.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in the case where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This is particularly important in maintaining a clear winner and avoiding further complications in the election process. The Electoral College system has consistently produced a clear winner, preventing the need for additional rounds of voting and potential confusion.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are typically those who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe their vote might decide the outcome. Additionally, the current system still encourages candidates to campaign in all states, even if some are considered safe for one party or the other.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system is crucial for maintaining a fair and effective method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, representation for all regions, targeted campaigning in swing states, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner without the need for run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals to change the current system. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to representing the interests of our state and the nation.

Sincerely,

"It seems that almost everyone I know has a car. However, cars are the creators of a large number of problems. There are a number of reasons that less car usage would be beneficial to our society. This could include limiting pollution and congestion, improving health, as well as saving money.

Cars are responsible for a large part of greenhouse gas and carbon emissions. Cutting car usage would immensely help our environment, which is a goal that many people want to achieve. In some cities in the United States of America, cars are responsible for as much as 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Some cities, like Beijing, China are so polluted, that smog is abundant throughout much of the city, making walking and other outdoor physical activities very unpleasant. Limiting car usage would help narrow that pollution a lot. Our environment has been negatively affected for a long time due to car usage, so it is time for that to change.

While many people would say that cars are a necessary means of transportation, there are many other available sources to cut car usage. These sources could include walking, bicycling, skating, taking a bus, carpooling, as well as many other activities. Not only do some of those activities not pollute our environment, but they are also healthy exercises. Cars are also a large reason for accidents and injuries. A large number of people die or get injured every day due to car crashes. While many people are safe drivers, car accidents are almost unavoidable.

Limiting car usage is another way of saving money, which is something that just about everyone I know wants to do. You end up spending a lot of hard earned money on gas or insurance rates because of cars. I know that many of my teenage friends are always bugging their parents for gas money. By using other means of transportation, that money could be saved and spent on something worthwhile to you.

By now, you should see all the positive effects of limiting car usage. While cars are a large part of transportation, there are a number of available sources of transportation that can be used instead. I hope that next time you are planning on going somewhere, whether it be spending time with friends or going to work, you will think about another source of transportation besides a car.",0

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my position on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election process for the President of the United States. After careful consideration and examination of multiple viewpoints, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system rather than changing to a popular vote system. The Electoral College serves several important purposes, including providing a certainty of outcome, promoting regional inclusivity, focusing campaign efforts, balancing power between large and small states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome is significantly reduced, offering stability and avoiding prolonged disputes over the popular vote. In an already complex electoral process, a clear outcome is essential for maintaining public trust and confidence in our democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner points out, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on highly populated urban centers or densely populated regions, but instead take into account the concerns and interests of diverse populations across the nation. This inclusivity fosters a sense of unity among different regions and prevents the presidency from becoming dominated by a few states or regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states or toss-up states where the outcome is less certain. This prompts candidates to not only pay attention to the concerns of these states but also actively engage with voters and address their specific needs. This focus on swing states leads to a more informed and engaged electorate as voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. The Electoral College system, therefore, promotes a greater degree of voter participation and thoughtful decision-making.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to balance the power between large and small states. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to Senate mal-apportionment. By giving each state a number of electoral votes based on its population, the system ensures that presidential candidates cannot solely rely on the support of heavily populated states. This recognition of smaller states' interests prevents elections from being dominated by highly populous regions or urban centers, ensuring that the voices of rural and less-populated areas are also heard and their concerns addressed.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This not only simplifies the electoral process but also saves time and resources. Without the Electoral College, our election process could become more complex and prone to prolonged campaigns, which can be costly and may hinder the smooth functioning of our democratic system. The current system, by consistently producing a clear winner, ensures a smooth transition and allows the President to govern with a mandate from the electoral majority.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves important purposes in our democracy. It provides a certainty of outcome, promotes regional inclusivity, focuses campaign efforts, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Although there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the perception of some voters that their votes may not count, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will carefully consider the information presented in this letter. I hope that you will support the continuation of the Electoral College as it has served our nation well for over two centuries.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my perspective on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping this system for the election of the President of the United States.

As the Office of the Federal Register describes, the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President by Congress and by popular vote. The system includes the selection of electors, the electoral vote by those electors, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress (Passage 1). This process ensures a balanced representation of each state, as the number of electors is determined by the total members of Congress from each state (Passage 3). This contributes to the protection of smaller states against potential dominance by larger states, as it prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated regions and encourages the consideration of all citizens' interests.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the winner of the Electoral College inevitably obtains a majority of electoral votes, even if their share of the popular vote is slight (Passage 18). This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results and ensures a clear winner. On the other hand, if the popular vote alone determined the outcome, disputes could arise more frequently, leading to prolonged legal battles and uncertain results.

The Electoral College also promotes a sense of unity and representation for all citizens. Posner states that the system requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure a presidency (Passage 19). This encourages candidates to campaign in various states and address the concerns of diverse regions, promoting a balanced representation of all citizens' interests. In contrast, a popular vote system may lead to candidates solely focusing on densely populated areas and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populous regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states, which are crucial in deciding the election outcome (Passage 20). These states are more likely to receive more campaign efforts, resulting in better-informed voters who actively participate in the election process. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a deciding role in electing the President.

Lastly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of large and small states. Posner highlights that the popular vote in a large state, such as Florida, carries more weight in the Electoral College system compared to a small state like Wyoming (Passage 21). This prevents large states from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of citizens in both large and small states.

While some argue that the Electoral College could discourage voters in non-competitive states, it is worth noting that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, indicating that individuals still have the motivation to express their political preferences (Passage 23).

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system that ensures fair representation for all citizens and provides certainty in election outcomes. It encourages candidates to campaign across all states, avoids disputes over results, and balances the influence of large and small states. For these reasons, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Over the years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to promote smarter planning, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable communities. This shift in thinking has led to the development of car-free neighborhoods, driving bans due to pollution, and initiatives like car-free days. By limiting car usage, we can experience several benefits that positively impact our environment and overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely known that passenger cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. This is especially crucial in car-intensive areas in the United States, where cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has several positive effects on public health. Car-free neighborhoods and initiatives like car-free days create an environment that promotes walking, biking, and the use of public transportation. This active lifestyle helps to combat sedentary behavior and its associated health problems, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. By encouraging more physical activity, we can improve the overall health and well-being of our communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a significant decrease in traffic. Without cars on the streets, these neighborhoods become more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, there is less congestion and more freedom of movement. This not only saves time for residents but also contributes to a safer and more enjoyable neighborhood environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact communities. By placing stores within walking distance and implementing better public transportation systems, we can reduce the need for long-distance car travel. This new approach to community development allows for more efficient land use and reduces the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. As a result, we can create more livable neighborhoods that prioritize human connection and sustainability.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By doing so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, decrease traffic congestion, and create more sustainable communities. With the growing recognition of the negative impacts of car culture, it is important to embrace alternatives and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars. In doing this, we can create a healthier, greener, and more enjoyable environment for all.",1
"There is a new age coming,and with that means change. Most people dont like change but this change is a good one. Its using your car less and use other means of transportation around your city or town. This leads to less smog around a major city and a safer inviorment for children.

To begin , changing how we travel around the city and towns of are country's is essential in this time of age. The world is changing how we think and do thing is changing. We are losing some of are ignorance. The world we live on is running out of oil and that means no more gas powered cars. To conserve the resources we have we need to start taking the bus to work or school. Or riding a skateboard to the shop down the street instead of wasting presious resources that is going to dissaper in 20 to 30 years. And not using your car is a go thing ,that means less stress on you mind a body. imagin not having to worry about a car payment and having that extra money have fun with your kids. Useing your car less also means less smog and cleaner air around. For example, in Pairs there was lot of smog so they put a ban on cars for two days and it cleared up the city. Now if started doing this more we would help are interment so much.

second off, Not using your car as much also creates a much safer environment for kids. And they can live a more healthy life. And thats what we want, we want to protect are kids a give them a child hood they can look back on. This means you can let your kid outside and not worrying about a drunk driver coming down the street and hitting your kid and killing them. We want the best futer for are grandchilderns children, and know we set them up for good. We need to start designing are towns and city's like Vauban ,Germany. It will make a better and cleaner world for us.

In conclusion, we need to put down the car keys and pick up the bike , or hop on the bus. Because Time is running out. And we dont want it to be to late to change. This is the only thig we got. So lets do it right the firts time and not screw it up.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthy lifestyles, and create more connected and accessible communities.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By using alternative forms of transportation such as walking, cycling, or public transportation, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage set mentions that smog in cities like Paris and Bogota has led to driving bans in order to reduce pollution levels. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of harmful pollutants released into the air, which can have positive impacts on public health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthy lifestyles. When people rely less on cars, they tend to engage in more physical activity such as walking or cycling. This can help reduce the rates of obesity and other lifestyle-related diseases. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are restricted, residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without the constant need for a car. This suggests that reducing car usage can contribute to overall well-being and quality of life.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help create more connected and accessible communities. In the passage set, it is mentioned that Vauban has stores placed within walking distance, rather than being located in distant malls. This allows residents to have easier access to essential services and encourages a sense of community. By prioritizing public transportation and walkability, we can create neighborhoods that are more inclusive and less dependent on cars.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting healthy lifestyles, and creating more connected communities, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is important for individuals and society to consider alternative forms of transportation and implement smart planning strategies in order to achieve these benefits.",1
"What is the one thing a citizen of the united states sees just about everyday of their lives, vehicles. Vehicles are one of the most important creations America has ever had to offer but sadly there is a catch its killing this planet we call Earth. But there is a simple way to stop this atrocity from going any further. Its quite simple really all we need to do is limit our time driving. The advantages of doing this will help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and help urban and rural areas feel more like a community.

its incredible how with time communitys stopped being what they used to be. What happened to everyone knowing everyone in their community. Well if we limit the time of driving not only will we need to find people to carpool with, Americans are going to start meeting new people and start becoming more of a community again. study last year has shown that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. They either biked everywhere or carpooled with friends and family becoming dependent on other people in their communitys.

The danger and stress that comes with driving is unmeasurable. overtime you drive on the road you are putting your life and everyone your driving with lives in danger. Its only reasonable to say the less amount of people driving the less stressed Americans are. In the passage carfree day spinning into a big hit in bogota, by andrew selsky he states ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" and many other articles state that as well such as In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars written by Elisabeth Rosenthal ""when i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way"". Driving less stressed will also lead to less accidents and less deaths per year.

Pitch black sky, every breath you take is killing you, and you wonder why did this happen, and you think back to all the advice people gave to you about driving. The future is sometimes hard to think about when your living in the present but the future will come and what it is will be based on what you make it. Air pollution is one of the biggest risks to this earth we have. To help stop this pollution well have to give up on using gas but for now lets take a baby step and just limit our time driving. Many communitys have stopped and or limited their time driving. Bogota located in colombia, paris, Vauban located in germany, why not just limit time spent driving in America.

Let us be the last of a dying breed and the birth of a new generation by being role models and start acting as americans worried about this planet. Out of everything asked for us to do this is only a tiny portion of it. This change will not only help us altogether it will change the outcome of the future for the better.",0
"  Pioneering Sustainable Urban Living  In an age characterized by rapid urbanization and the pressing need for environmental sustainability, car-free cities are emerging as a revolutionary concept. These cities prioritize sustainable transportation options over private automobiles, promoting cleaner air, healthier communities, and more efficient urban living. This essay delves into the idea of car-free cities, exploring their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities represent a forward-thinking vision of urban living that emphasizes sustainability, health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a significant role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.  Public Health: Car-free cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels promote better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being among urban residents.  Optimal Use of Space: These cities efficiently repurpose urban space by converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be financially burdensome. In car-free cities, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, which can contribute to their overall financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The shift to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities depends on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a critical aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  To successfully realize car-free cities, strategies include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and prioritizing public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthy goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to both individuals and the environment. By adopting a car-free or car-reduced lifestyle, communities can enjoy improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less traffic congestion, and better public health. This can be achieved through the development of smart planning strategies and the promotion of alternative modes of transportation.

One of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate their harmful effects. This is particularly important for areas with high car usage, such as suburbs and cities.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to smog demonstrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially those with diesel engines, we can improve air quality and create a healthier living environment for residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, showcases the positive impact of such initiatives on traffic flow. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as buses, bikes, and walking, communities can alleviate traffic congestion and create more efficient transportation systems.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve public health. The passage mentions how a car-reduced lifestyle can lead to lower stress levels and a happier life. This is supported by the statement from a resident of the car-free community, Vauban, who mentioned feeling happier without a car. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages physical activity through walking and cycling, which can reduce the risk of obesity and related health issues.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and significant. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation modes, and creating car-free or car-reduced communities, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and enhance public health. These actions are crucial for a sustainable future and the well-being of both individuals and the environment.",1
"The world is advancing, technologies are being built, and the environment is changing. Imagine living in an area where there's a limited car usage. It might sound horrible but life goes on without cars. As to limiting your car usage it also has it's advantages. The advantages goes towards the people and the environment.

To start, everyone would know that the main reason is because of the state of our environment. There's a lot of pollution going out there in the world and it's not safe or natural. To give an example, according to the article, written by elisabeth Rosenthal, ""In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", passenger cars are responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas and fifty percent in carintensive areas in the United States. To exemplify, greenhouse gases is one of the causes for the changes around the environment. They're not the good changes either. To support this, the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", written by Robert Duffer, shows an example of Paris and China banning car usage due to their high pollution and smogs. Robert Duffer states, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" In other words, polllution can hold a great affect of people trying to go to work, have fun, or even visit someone. Not only is change in the environment is bad but some people can just live without the use of transportation.

The continue to the advantages, the people get to spend their time with others more and even be happy just walking around. Going back to the article ""In German Suburb, life Goes On Without Cars"" written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a mother of two and media trainer, Heidrun Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" To extend this, having a car would cause some people to be tense and stressed. Without the ability to do anything about it but just sit there or walk, it is much better to walk around with the people who's close. Another example would from the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selksy, another commentary made from a businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees with it. Carlos Arturo Plaza states ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In other words, not only is the carfree day works for helping improve the environment, it's good for releasing stress for few people.

To conclude, letting go of driving around may sound like a disadvantage but it's actually an advantage to those around us. It's an advantage for both the environment and us.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This approach, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from excessive auto use. By reducing the dependency on cars, communities can promote alternative transportation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve the overall quality of life.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing car ownership and promoting alternative transportation options, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to environmental sustainability.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. Smog, a major issue in many cities worldwide, is often caused by car emissions. An example of the detrimental effects of car usage can be seen in Paris, where after days of near-record pollution, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air. The ban resulted in a 60% reduction in congestion and an improvement in air quality. By restricting car usage and promoting car-free days, cities can improve air quality, which ultimately benefits public health.

In addition, limiting car usage can enhance the quality of life for individuals. By reducing traffic congestion, people can have shorter travel times and less stress. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, residents reported feeling happier and more relaxed without the constant need to drive. The promotion of alternative transportation, such as walking and cycling, also encourages physical activity, leading to healthier and more active lifestyles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can spur urban development and economic growth. By adopting ""smart planning"" principles, communities can create more compact and accessible suburbs. Placing stores on main streets instead of distant highways and improving public transportation options can boost local businesses and attract investment. Additionally, by reducing the amount of land dedicated to parking lots and garages, communities can utilize that space for other purposes, such as parks and recreational areas.

Overall, limiting car usage brings about multiple advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, enhanced quality of life, and economic growth. By embracing alternative transportation options and adopting ""smart planning"" principles, communities can create more sustainable and livable environments. It is crucial for both individuals and policymakers to recognize the importance of reducing car dependency and promoting a shift towards more environmentally friendly and efficient modes of transportation.",1
"We should keep our method of chosing a president even though many dont agree because of a few reasons. One, big states. Two, avoid run off elections. Finnaly, to determine the certainty of outcome.

First, the issue of big states. States are put in two categories, big states and small states, according to population. Presidential candidates give more of their attention during the campaign to the larger states. As a result of electoral college the big states have more electors and thus more votes. For example, in Forida, the popular vote was extremely close in 2012, Obama who won, got 29 electoral votes. If obama had spent that time in Wyoming, he would have only had gotten 3 electoral votes.

Second, to avoid run off elections. Using the electoral college we avoid the problem of elections where no candidate receives a majority. the electoral college can produce a clear winner rather than pressure when no candidate wins majority and complications of the process. Two examples of this in 1968 and 1992 with president nixon and president Clinton. They both had 43 percent plurality of popular vote, while winning a majority of electoral college.

Finnally, to determine Certainty of outcome. Since, almost all states have electoral votes on a winner takes all basis, even the slightest plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. Although, it is possible to have a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college, for instance in 20000, it is much less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. And even though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number of 538, it is extremely unlikely to happen.

You could argue that the method of selecting a president through Electoral college may turn off potential voters for a candidate that has no hope if carrying their state, knowing their vote will have no effect. Then they might have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigngn. But being realistic, no voters one vote swings a national election, and about one half of the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election.

In conclusion, the reasons we shoud kee our current method of chosng the countries president is becuause of big states, to avoid run off elections, and to determine he certainty of outcome. Even though some dont agree it has been working for us in the past an can contiue working for us to chose our president in the future.",0
"Freedom to chose our leader is nothing more than an illusion. Voters have absolutely no saying in who shall take their place on the presidential seat. This is what the Electoral College does. It is an archaic system and unreliable system in which the whole of the presidential election is decided by the bias of the few whom are ""pledged"" to a certain party but at the end can choose whoever the like the most. This is not the Democracy we so dearly hold in our hearts like Americans and it goes well against the principles our forefathers taught us as free pople. Undeniably the Electoral College negates any concept of the democracy of America, making the impotance of the will of the people meaningless and nothing more than an illusion.

Deep into our history is the recaunting of how such a terrible system as the Electoral College came to be. It was originally a settlement on the dispute of how the president should be elected, either by the people or by Congress. Now the first option would have been the perfect one, but there are always those who would firts dei to loose their power to the pople of our country. And the clash of interest was so large it could have broken the nation in two as we have seen happened a few times in history. As such a great many years have passed since this whole argument and at every election poeple are realizing the faults of this flawed concept. At its core the system is Useless. It is the most antidemocratic idea ever to have been in practice and one that still is in use. It overpowers the will of millions with the will of a few hundred. That is why such a monster should be abolished.

The year is 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush clash for the seat in the white house. The election draws to an end and the votes are counted. There is a clear discrepancy in the votes, making Al Gore the winner, and by all means, the next president of the United States of America. But somewhere else there's also a clear discrepancy. Back at the Electoral College the counting says Bush won against Al Gore even though Al had already won the poeple of America. On that election 5 pople choose the fate of an entire nation. 5 people only. Such a thing is outrageous, and we are lucky it hasn't happened again nor more frequently. But thing is it shouldn't happen at all. That's ehy the POEPLE should choose insted of 538 what'stheirfaces. This endevour proves one thing and one thing only.

Unreliability. It is illogical that one wins the masses of the common citizens but looses because of five well dressed ones.

The Electoral College is a monster. A wild dice which at one moment can favor you and at the next one destroy you. This isn't how America works.",0
"Many people are not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Many prefer changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States since the Electoral College is unfair. It is. The electoral college is unfair in many ways and we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

One reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote instead of the Electoral College is because the states aren't all equal and electoral college isn't fair. In the Electoral College, California has more of a say than Georgia. California has 55 electoral college, while Georgia has 16. How is that fair? ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" Plumer 13. This line tells us that candidates stay out of states that they know they won't win. Say there was a candidate campaigning, they will most likely focus on the states that have the most electoral college, like California or Texas. They won't go to states that only have three votes. That's not fair to the states that have a small population. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" Posner 6. If electoral votes wasn't a thing, Gore would be president. He's the candidate that won most popular votes, meaning that he got the most votes in the nation. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" Plumer 10. Not always? What's the point of voting if the vote won't even count?

Another reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote is because the popular vote will be more precise and it's much easier. There could be less ties, and the candidate that everyone really wants as president will become the president. ""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" Posner 16. Gore was the candidate that everyone wanted as president. It just doesn't seem fair that the candidate that won popular vote, isn't or wasn't the president.

Overall, the people should change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States instead of using a system that is unfair to the states and the people.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. Several examples from different parts of the world show the positive impact that reducing reliance on cars can have on the environment, health, and quality of life.

One striking example is the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden on the streets. In Vauban, car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park, and as a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This has led to a happier and less stressed community, as stated by residents themselves. Vauban is part of a larger trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from car use, known as ""smart planning."" This movement aims to make suburbs more compact, walkable, and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by cars, which account for a significant portion of emissions in both Europe and the United States.

Paris, France, implemented a partial driving ban due to severe smog caused by car emissions. The ban was effective in reducing congestion by 60 percent, and while it caused inconveniences for some businesses, exceptions were made for certain vehicles like hybrids and cars carrying multiple passengers. This temporary ban demonstrates the immediate impact that limiting car usage can have on reducing air pollution and improving air quality.

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day is held to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participate in activities like biking, walking, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event has been successful in raising awareness about the benefits of reducing car usage and has inspired other cities to implement similar initiatives.

The shift away from car culture is also happening in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year. While part of this decline can be attributed to the economic recession, it is also driven by a fundamental change in behavior. Factors such as advances in technology, the rise of telecommuting, and the availability of alternative transportation options like bike-sharing and carpooling have contributed to this cultural shift away from car ownership.

Reducing car usage can have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the United States. It can also improve quality of life by reducing congestion, promoting physical activity through alternative modes of transportation, and creating more walkable and livable communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution to improving community health and quality of life. Examples from different parts of the world demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car reliance through initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, temporary driving bans, and car-free days. This shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals and communities, leading to happier, healthier, and more sustainable lifestyles.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can have a significant impact on both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight several examples of communities and cities that have embraced the idea of reducing car dependency and reaping the benefits.

According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions in both Europe and the United States. By decreasing car usage and encouraging alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, communities can effectively reduce their carbon footprint.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality in urban areas. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog indicates that the ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant decrease in air pollution. This demonstrates that implementing policies to limit car usage can have a direct impact on the quality of the air we breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a more sustainable and livable community. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban illustrates how creating car-free streets and reducing car ownership can enhance residents' quality of life. People in Vauban reported feeling happier and less stressed without the presence of cars. Adopting a similar approach in other communities can create safer and more enjoyable environments for everyone.

Another advantage is the potential for economic savings. The passage about the United States' decreasing car ownership and driving suggests that limiting car usage can have beneficial implications for personal finances. With the rising costs associated with owning a car, such as fuel, maintenance, and insurance, individuals can save money by utilizing alternative transportation methods. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to reduced infrastructure costs for building and maintaining roads, parking spaces, and other car-related infrastructure.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage, as highlighted by the passages provided. These include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating more sustainable communities, and providing economic savings.

"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can have a positive impact on both individuals and the environment. The passage set provides several examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to reduce reliance on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban, Germany, and during car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, these communities have been able to decrease their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. This is crucial in combating climate change and improving air quality.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on mental well-being. Residents of Vauban, Germany reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. The freedom from the constant tension associated with driving is a compelling reason for many to limit their car usage. Furthermore, the shift towards more compact and accessible communities, as seen in Vauban and other planned developments, encourages walking and cycling, which can improve physical health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Limiting car usage can also lead to increased efficiency and economic benefits. The car-free days in Bogota resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion, allowing for smoother traffic flow and shorter commute times. This can improve productivity and reduce economic losses associated with traffic congestion. Additionally, the development of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and bike-sharing programs, can create employment opportunities and stimulate economic growth.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote a sense of community and social interaction. By creating pedestrian-friendly streets and placing stores within walking distance, as seen in Vauban and other planned developments, people are more likely to engage in face-to-face interactions and form social connections. This can improve community cohesion and create a more vibrant and livable urban environment.

It is important to note that the advantage of limiting car usage does not mean completely eliminating cars. Car ownership is still allowed in Vauban, Germany, but with limited parking spaces at the edge of the development. This allows for those who require a car to have access to one, while encouraging alternative modes of transportation for everyday activities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvements in mental and physical well-being, increased efficiency and economic benefits, and the promotion of community and social interaction. As demonstrated in the passages, communities and cities around the world are adopting measures to limit car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation.

"Dear Florida Senator, There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote. I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now. They wouldn't have to worry about the electors flipping sides. Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population.

To begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters. Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not. As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"". In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all. Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for. The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what. The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the rodney and Obama election is mentioned. It brings up the fact that rodney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote. He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes. Those who opposed rodney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for rodney. If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in.

In addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions. The slate of electors is not picked by the people. It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors. That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not. For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen. A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now. This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes. You can see that the current system has its flaws.

Many people say that it is fair for all states because of their amount of electoral votes. For example, in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", Florida, which has a much larger population than Wyoming, recieved 29 electoral votes for Obama while Wyoming only had 3 electoral votes. This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes. The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated.

In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote. Above all, it is more fair to the people. Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now. People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for. Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College. I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College. All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree.",0

Subject: The Importance of Preserving the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of electing the president by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides important advantages that should not be dismissed.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This minimizes the chances of a prolonged election crisis and ensures a definitive result.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. This method requires a presidential candidate to have support from various regions, ensuring that the president represents the entire nation. As Judge Posner explains, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents, as residents from other regions may feel disenfranchised and believe that their interests are not being prioritized. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across different states and engage with voters from diverse backgrounds.

Additionally, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain and can swing either way. By doing so, candidates are compelled to pay attention to issues that matter to voters in these states. This ensures that voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, allowing them to make more informed choices.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balanced representation for both large and small states. As highlighted in Judge Posner's article, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the disproportionate apportionment of the Senate. By granting more electoral votes to larger states, presidential candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and needs of these states. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the election process and avoids potential complications that may arise from run-off elections. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College ensures that the will of the people is accurately represented.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" it is important to consider the practical benefits that come with this method of electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the representation of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These advantages are crucial for ensuring that the president elected is representative of the entire nation. Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in presidential elections. While many argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves several crucial functions that ensure fairness, certainty, and representation in our democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system employed by most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide victory in terms of electoral votes. Despite its occasional disputes, the Electoral College has a proven track record of producing a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and uncertainty that may arise from a direct popular vote, where a dispute over the outcome is more likely.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is a representative for all regions of the country. This system requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal and prevents a candidate with solely regional support from winning the presidency. As a result, residents from all regions feel that their votes count and that the elected president will consider their interests. This is crucial for maintaining national unity and preventing the disenfranchisement of certain groups of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College directs campaign efforts towards swing states. This focus on swing states generates engagement and attention from the most thoughtful voters, as they are aware that their vote may sway the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to address the concerns and needs of these voters, resulting in a more informed electorate and a candidate who has a comprehensive understanding of the diverse needs of the nation.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to give a fair weight to both large and small states. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate may lead to political imbalances, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive greater attention from candidates during campaigns. This grants citizens in larger states a sense of significance and influence in the election process, ultimately giving them a voice in electing the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process and prolong the decision-making time. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This streamlines the election process and avoids the costly and time-consuming efforts of organizing run-off elections.

Despite criticism from its opponents, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system. It ensures certainty, representation, and fairness in presidential elections, while also allowing small and swing states to have a substantial say in the outcome. While there may be room for reforms within the Electoral College, abolishing it altogether would undermine the principles of our Constitution and erode the delicate balance of power among states.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will take my views into account when evaluating potential changes to the electoral process. Our democracy depends on a fair and effective system for electing our president, and I believe that the Electoral College continues to fulfill this role admirably.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided demonstrate the benefits of reducing car dependency in different parts of the world. From the case of Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and are much happier, to the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, that aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, the evidence shows that limiting car usage can lead to positive outcomes.

One of the main advantages of reducing car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, both in Europe and the United States. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the US, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can reduce these emissions and contribute to efforts to combat climate change.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve the quality of life for individuals. The passage about Vauban, Germany, highlights how residents feel happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. Without the constant noise and pollution of cars, streets become more peaceful and pleasant for walking and cycling. This can also have positive health effects, as walking and cycling are good forms of exercise. Furthermore, reducing car usage can reduce traffic congestion, which is a major problem in many cities around the world. Less traffic means shorter commute times and less frustration for individuals.

There are also economic advantages to limiting car usage. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog demonstrates how congestion was reduced by 60 percent during the driving ban. This reduction in traffic can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, as more people choose alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or cycling, it can lead to a decrease in fuel consumption and result in cost savings for individuals and the government.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve the quality of life for individuals, reduce traffic congestion, and bring economic benefits. As evidenced by the examples in the passages, there are successful initiatives and experiments in different parts of the world that aim to limit car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation. By implementing similar strategies and encouraging individuals to rely less on cars, we can create more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Times are changing, and changing fast. While the car may once have been the ideal accessory to a rapidly changing world, people have now found that the opposite is now true. Limiting car usage is cheaper, better for the environment, and is quickly becoming the ""cool"" thing to do. America's fascination with the 1950's fords are over, and a new era is upon us.

Cutting down on car usage is much cheaper. Between the expensive vehicle itself and enormous gas bill, It's more fiscally responsible to carpool, use public transportation, or even walk. Places like Vauban in Germany are just the start of a quickly growing social trend to make cars more expensive. As stated in Source 1, ""There are only two places to parkLarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home"". Places like Paris have even been known to enact partial driving bans at times, with 22euro fines enacted for those who failed to follow the ban. Driving, an already expensive task, is increasingly becoming a task only the rich can afford.

Removing some of our outrageous motor vehicle usage is also good for the environment. As mentioned in Source 2, Smog that was already prevalent in places like Beijing, China has found it's way into modern European cities like Paris, with more to follow if we do't cut back, and soon. Paris has known to have over 147 Micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, with other cities like Brussels and London having 114 and 79.7 respectively. If that didn't seem bad enough, it's worse in other areas. In some areas of the United States, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions.

Having a lower dependence on cars isn't just good for the environment, it's now become ""cool"". The amount of driving done by young people has decresased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, and even big companies are starting to notice. As stated in Source 3, Bill Ford, the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, acknowleged the growing change, and even offered suggestions to help. He proposed a better system to save time and resources while improving gas emissions and public safety. Meanwhile in Bogota Colombia, Millions of citizens in participated""Day Without Cars,"" A yearly program set up in the city.

While 10 years ago might have painted a different picture, the writing on the wall is clear. There's a global trend for decreasing dependency on cars, and it's not looking to stop anytime soon. A once needed tool is quickly becoming less and less relevent, due to cheaper costs, less strain on the environment, and the always prevalent ""cool factor."" It's not the golden age of cars anymore, and about time changes were made to match modern day thinking.",0
"Dear Senator, I strongly suggest that you keep the Electoral college because of the different benefits it has to offer. It creates more of a certain outcome. Also, it is a way to avoid runoff elections. Even though there may be some negative outcomes to this way of voting, I feel that the advantages overlook them.

The Electoral college is a good method of our voting system in the United States because it helps to develop a more certain outcome. According to the passage titled In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, it states that ""Because almost all states award electoral votes ona winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" This tell that vote is plenty more certain using this method rather than to go by popular vote. With having a more precise and organized plan of voting it guarantees a more certain outcome and will prepare for problems that may occur such as ties in the election. The Electoral College is most definitely a an great voting method when used for certainty.

Another reason why The Electoral College is a great method of voting is because it is a way to avoid runoff elections. According to the same article titled In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner it tells that ""There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which in variable produces a clear winner."" An example of this stated in the article is ""Nixon in 19680and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College"". Avoiding these types of things is very important. If we didnt have this method we would still have to come up with some sort of method so that thing like runoffs don't happen. However, some people disagree with the electoral college because they feel that they aren't really voting for the candidate, it still needs to be used because to many thing can happen such as ties and runoffs that we would need to figure out in the long run.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important and needs to continue to be our voting method for the United States. Certainty of the votes outcome and avoiding runoff election are twp ways Electoral votes have helped us. Without this method we would have to be dealing with these issues in some other kind of way.",0
"FREEDOM!

We are all americans here so we should have the freedom we were ment to have. I understand that we do in fact have a lot more freedom than other countries but I am talking more on voting freedom. The electoral collegee is, in my opinion and many others, a bad way to decide the president of the United States of America. I believe that for americans we should have a better say in things and agree that we rather have popular voting than what we have now. Others believe the electoral collegee helps with Big States issues. But in the end popular vote is a good way to help people who deserver presidency to get it.

The article The Indefensible Electoral College, many have agreed on abolishing the electoral college. The article The Indefensible Electoral College... states ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to what we are doing now."" If we the people do not get final say into things than we are'nt really as free as we are told we are. If the people want a different voting system it should be granted to us. A good example to people who had been effected by this was Al Gore. The article states. ""Al Gore who had won by popular vote but still lost the presidency to the electoral collegee."" This goes to show that he was someone that many wanted as a president but where cheated out by the electoral collegee.

Others may believe that the electoral collegee helps not let bigger and more populated states get more attention than a smaller state would. But even by popular vote this would be the same. If a populated state votes then they will get basically the same say as they would with the electoral collegee but it would give them more say. Whilst other low population states get less votes and attention just like with the electoral collegee. So even though it would make a great change with other things, this matter is no problem.

Few have lost presidency due to the quirks in the electoral collegee. A good example is Al Gore who I talked about earlier. But still in the future changing to popular vote will help people who earned presidency actually get it. Instead of being scammed out of their votes by the electoral collegee. If someone has earned the presidencty then they should have the right to it, but with the electoral collegee in the way some are unable to actually do this. If we the people want someone to be the president than we want them! Al Gore won popular vote but since we do not get the only say he had lost presidency. If popular demand was the only voting system than we would probably be in a better place right now.

In conclusion, we the people of the united states deserve to actually have our own and only say in to who is going to lead us. If we say we want them, we want them... I understand that we our the ones that get the say, but we are being evened out by state percentage, so basically popular voting is ruled out. Popular voting is a better way to vote mainly because it is straight forward and to the point. If someone receives more individual votes than they should be the president... It is a easy straight forward process...",0
"A ""car free"" community has many advantages. They will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. They will also help you save more money by not having to pay for a car, and if you do, you can park it in a garage for 40,000. This will also expand other transportation and will have a new sixyear federal transportation bill. There is no disadvantages for having a ""carfree"" community. Many countries and cities are participating in limiting car usage to make the air better and cleaner.

First, and most important, is that reducing cars also reduces the greenhouse gas emission. People that participate in this are most likely doing it to make the air we breath better. In some overpopulated cities, the amount of smog is crazy. After just one day without some cars, the amount of smog disappeared. London had the idea for evennumbered license plates to be banned to drive one day, even though some people still used their cars. So more than half the cars are still on the road, and it reduced smog so much, they didn't even need to ban the odd numbered cars. This is the most important reason why people are limiting car usage.

Next, if you live in a car free community, you will never have to pay for your car. You can sell it to make more money because you will never have to use it. This is much better than owning a car and having to park it in a garage for 40,000. If you ever need to take the bus, you will have the money. With the extra money you can buy a bike also. The stores will be walking distances, so there is no need for a car. I think this is a great idea for not only a better community, but it would help people socialize with neighbors and it saves money while doing it. After World War II, the cities would start reconstructing around the car, but now that is beggining to change in Vauban, Germany.

Last, the cities are trying to expand public transportation, such as taxis and buses. It would promote these and play a much larger role in a new sixyear federal transportation bill. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways by law and 20 percent have gone to other transportation. If the city bans cars, you can either walk, skate, bike, or ride the bus or taxi. In America, the amount of cars being bought and license plates being bought are decreasing since 1995. President Obama has an ambitious goal on which he unvieled last week and he wants to get rid of green house gas emissions.

In conclusion, I think you would agree that limiting car usage has its advantages. It reduces greenhouse gases and also smog. After one day, Paris was clear of gas and smog in the air. The gas gets caught under the atmosphere and is dangerous. Limiting car usage also will help you save money because you no longer will have a car to pay for. Also, it would boost other forms of transportation, such as buses and taxis. This is a great idea to limit cars.",0

Subject: In Support of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital and necessary component of our democratic process. In this letter, I will present several reasons based on the information provided in the passages to support my claim.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. As we have seen in previous elections, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This serves to create a clear and decisive victory, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results (Posner, 18). Furthermore, the winner-take-all method employed by most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory, making ties in the nationwide electoral vote highly improbable (Posner, 18).

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is a representative of the entire nation and not just certain regions. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal to secure enough electoral votes for victory. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning the popular vote in specific regions, which may result in a president who only prioritizes the interests of a specific area while disregarding others (Posner, 19). By requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of states, the Electoral College ensures that the president is genuinely ""everyone's president.""

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are instrumental in deciding the election outcomes. Swing states receive significant attention, as candidates recognize the importance of winning their electoral votes. This mechanism compels candidates to engage with voters in these states, resulting in more informed and thoughtful voters who play a decisive role in the election (Posner, 20). This focus on swing states leads to a more competitive and engaging electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political power held by large and small states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may result in a disparity in the political influence of states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states during their campaigns. In this way, the Electoral College offsets the potential imbalance caused by the Senate's structure, ensuring that states of all sizes have their concerns and interests addressed by presidential candidates (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the potential complications and additional expenses associated with such elections. Instead, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, thus maintaining stability in the election process (Posner, 22).

While some critics argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it should be noted that voter participation remains high despite this factor (Posner, 23). Voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if they understand that their vote may not swing a national election. The high turnout in presidential elections demonstrates a continued commitment to participating in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system of electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcomes, ensures a president who represents the entire nation, encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These advantages outweigh the arguments for changing to a popular vote system. I respectfully urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in our electoral process.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I look forward to your continued dedication to representing the interests of our state and our nation.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. While the Electoral College may have its critics, I firmly believe that this system has many advantages that outweigh the arguments for switching to a direct popular vote.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's report, the winner of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear and decisive victory, avoiding any potential disputes that may arise from a close popular vote. The possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely, and the Electoral College system ensures that the candidate with the broadest support across different regions becomes the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes inclusivity and prevents candidates from relying solely on the support of a single region. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that the system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure a victory. This means that candidates must reach out to voters in different states, ensuring that their concerns and issues are taken into account. It fosters national unity by preventing candidates from solely focusing on the interests of specific regions, making the president truly represent all Americans.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are crucial in determining the outcome of elections. In these toss-up states, candidates and their campaigns engage directly with voters, listen to their concerns, and tailor their platforms accordingly. This increases political participation and attentiveness among voters in these battleground states, as they know their votes can make a significant impact on the final outcome. By using the Electoral College, we empower the most thoughtful and engaged voters to determine the election.

Another key advantage of the Electoral College is that it balances the influence of large and small states. While some argue that this is unfair, it is important to recognize that it compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate in our Constitution. The Electoral College gives larger states with more electoral votes a greater voice in the election process, ensuring that they receive adequate attention from presidential candidates. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on small states and encourages them to address the concerns of all Americans, regardless of population size.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for costly and complicated runoff elections. By design, the Electoral College encourages candidates to seek a majority of electoral votes rather than just a plurality of the popular vote. This guarantees a clear winner and prevents the prolonged uncertainty and additional expenses associated with run-off elections. It streamlines the presidential election process and allows for a seamless transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy that has served us well for over two centuries. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes inclusivity by requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, encourages campaign efforts in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. While some argue for a switch to a direct popular vote, it is crucial to consider the practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College.

I urge you to support the Electoral College system and resist any attempts to abolish or change it. Let us continue to uphold the principles and compromises set forth by our founding fathers, ensuring a fair and effective presidential election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in presidential elections. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for several reasons outlined in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In recent history, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College has always exceeded their share of the popular vote, thus minimizing the likelihood of a dispute over the final result. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which would lead to a more complex resolution process. These factors contribute to stability and confidence in the electoral process.

Moreover, the Electoral College system ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system promotes inclusivity and prevents candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have a strong local support base. This ultimately ensures that the President considers the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The Electoral College also provides an opportunity for swing states to have a significant impact on elections. Toss-up states receive heightened attention from candidates, resulting in more engaged and informed voters. This means that the most thoughtful voters, who have received ample information from the candidates, can directly influence the election outcome. This system promotes an informed electorate and encourages candidates to address the concerns of diverse communities.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances power between large and small states. While mal-apportionment of the Senate can lead to disproportionate representation in Congress, the Electoral College compensates for this disparity. It ensures that large states receive more attention from candidates, considering their larger populations, while still providing a voice to small states. This balance is crucial for maintaining an equitable representation and preventing a concentration of power in certain regions.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. By producing a clear winner even when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, it simplifies the election process and avoids potential complications. This allows for a smooth transition of power and ensures that the President can govern with a mandate from the people.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democratic system. By providing a certainty of outcome, ensuring regional representation, promoting engagement in swing states, balancing power between large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections, it upholds the principles of fairness and stability in our presidential elections. I strongly urge you to consider the significance of these factors as you deliberate on any potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your dedicated service to our state and country.

"Cars are very important to the life of a modern person. The car gets you where you need to go in the time that you want to go in. There are ways to limit car usage and still get your transportation to where you need to go. There are some advantages to not using cars all the time. One advantage is that if we stop using cars, then pollution will drop drastically. Another advantage to us not using cars is that we get plenty of exercise while we do other things than just sit in our cars.

Paris, France. Known for being the city of love, but doesn't have a certain love for cars. They banned car usage after days of nearrecord pollutionsource 2 paragraph 10. In order to make sure that the residents don't use their cars still the placed a 22euro fine 31 for anyone still drivingsource 2 paragraph 11. After only just a few days, congestion was down almost 60 percent in the capital of France source 2 paragraph 14. In the United States, most kids these days aren't driving as much as they used to. They are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year source 4 paragraph 29. If this keeps up, then lot of sociologist think that this will have a huge effect on the environment, which will lead to the end of pollution problemssource 4 paragraph 34. This advantage of having less car usage will not only help the earth, but it also will help the things on the earth including us humans and animals.

The final advantage that limiting car usage is that we will have plenty of exercise. A mother of two that had a car but the sold it in Germany said "" When i had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way""source 1 paragraph 3. She usually walks down the street to and from wherever she goes. exercising is great for your health and you can just start by walking, biking, skating, roller blading and many more ways to get to where you need to go. In Bogota, Columbia millions of people hiked , biked, skated, or took buses to work source 3 paragraph 20. ""It's good opportunity to take away stress..."" source 3 paragraph 24 said businessman Carlos arturo Plaze when he was asked about the banning of cars for the third straight year in Germany source 3 paragraph 24. Stress isn't good for your health and excercising is great on removing that stress from your body. Excersisng is a great advantage to limited car usage because you reduce stress, work out, and feel better all while you get to where you need to go at the same time.

The advantages that everyone gets from limited car usage is that the pollution will go down, and you get better exercise. If pollution goes down then you will have a better earth for everyone to enjoy, but you can't enjoy the earth if it's congested with polutted air. You also get great exercise when you walk, bike, skate to wherever you need to go instead of sitting in a car to go to your destination. These are only some of the advantages that you get when you choose to limit your car usage, but there are plenty more that you will experience as soon as you limit the usage of cars.",0

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to share my perspective on the Electoral College and argue in favor of its retention in the system for electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, has proven to be an effective means of selecting our nation's leader, striking a balance between a popular vote and congressional appointment. 

One of the key arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. The winner-takes-all system employed by most states ensures that the candidate who wins the electoral vote will also win the presidency. This is beneficial in avoiding disputes over the election's outcome, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely due to the vast number of electors, making the Electoral College a more stable and reliable option.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"". This system requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to solely elect a president. By appealing to multiple regions, candidates must consider the interests and needs of diverse populations throughout the country. This ensures that the elected president represents the entirety of the nation, fostering national unity and minimizing regional disparities.

Moreover, the Electoral College enhances the significance of swing states. These states, often referred to as ""toss-up"" states, receive heightened attention from candidates due to the winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes. This means that voters in swing states are more likely to thoroughly research the candidates, carefully evaluate their policies, and make informed decisions. The focus on swing states encourages thoughtful voting, leading to a more engaged and aware electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance and value to larger states. While the popular vote holds significance, the Electoral College allows for equal representation and attention to be given to both large and small states. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College restores political weight to large states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate stipulated in the Constitution. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are considered during presidential campaigns and policies.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. This system guarantees that a candidate who wins a majority of electoral votes is elected president, avoiding the complex and costly process of run-offs. By ensuring a clear winner, the Electoral College streamlines the election process and provides voters with a decisive result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has been an integral part of our democratic process for centuries. It combines the principles of individual state sovereignty and national unity, promoting fairness and balanced representation. While there are valid criticisms of the system, the benefits it brings in terms of certainty, regional representation, swing state significance, balance among states, and avoidance of run-off elections, make it a crucial component of our presidential elections. I urge you to consider these points and continue supporting the Electoral College to maintain a fair and effective system of electing our nation's leader.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will take these points into account and make decisions that best serve the interests of our great state and country.

Sincerely,

"  A Paradigm Shift in Urban Living  In an era marked by increasing urbanization and environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities is gaining momentum as a transformative solution to the complex challenges faced by metropolitan areas. Car-free cities are urban environments that prioritize sustainable transportation alternatives over private automobiles, aiming to create cleaner, healthier, and more vibrant urban spaces. This essay explores the concept of car-free cities, highlighting their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for successful implementation.  Car-free cities embody a vision of urban living that champions sustainability and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a significant role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This environmentally responsible approach is essential in addressing the urgent issue of climate change.  Public Health: The emphasis on pedestrian and cyclist safety in car-free cities results in fewer accidents and improved public health. Decreased air pollution levels lead to better respiratory and cardiovascular health for residents.  Optimal Use of Urban Space: Car-free cities efficiently repurpose urban space, transforming parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This revitalizes the urban landscape and enhances the overall quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly diminished, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a costly endeavor. In car-free cities, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, the transition to car-free cities is not without its share of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes, leading to potential resistance to the transition due to concerns about convenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities hinges on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, offering convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and providing support to affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Redesigning urban areas for car-free living demands thorough planning and substantial investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  To successfully realize car-free cities, strategies include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation modes such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and prioritizing public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a compelling vision of a more sustainable and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthy goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a promising glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Limiting Car Usage: Advantages for the Future

In today's society, cars have become an integral part of everyday life. However, there is a growing movement towards limiting car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from the passages provided.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This staggering statistic highlights the significant impact of car usage on the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, emissions can be drastically reduced, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative forms of transportation. In the passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, it is mentioned that the streets are filled with bicycles and the chatter of children, rather than the noise of cars. This shift towards alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, not only reduces emissions but also promotes a healthier lifestyle. Walking and cycling are known to have numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of obesity. By limiting car usage, individuals are encouraged to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, leading to a more active and healthy population.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage mentions that in smart planning initiatives, stores are placed within walking distance rather than in distant malls. This approach reduces the need for extensive parking spaces and encourages community members to support local businesses. By creating compact communities, resources can be utilized more efficiently, reducing the need for excessive infrastructure.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota mentions that the event promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog. In addition to environmental benefits, reducing smog can have positive economic effects. Smog is known to cause health problems and increase healthcare costs. By limiting car usage and reducing smog, healthcare costs can be lowered, resulting in economic savings for individuals and society as a whole.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative forms of transportation, creating compact communities, and reducing smog, individuals and society can benefit both environmentally and economically. It is crucial for governments, communities, and individuals to come together and prioritize the limitation of car usage in order to create a sustainable and healthy future.",1
"Limiting car usage would be great for both you and the environment. If we didn't use cars as much, we would get more exercise, save more money, and limit the amount of air pollution we produce. We would start to notice changes for the better in our health, our budgeting, and the condition of the environment. I have gathered evidence from a few different sources to back up these claims. ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta"", and ""The End of Car Culture"" all go into detail about the benefits that did happen or could happen while we limit car usage.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the increase in exercise it will give you. Did you know that 70% of America is overweight? An advantage to walking or biking places that driving doesn't have is that walking or biking will get you active. It will help you burn calories and it will give you the selfconfidence of being in good shape. Sure, it might be hot out when you walk or bike places, but this problem can be solved by simply dressing appropriately for the activity. Wear something that you know you'll be comfortable getting exercise in. One business man riding a two seat bicycle with his wife instead of driving, said, ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution"", Source 3. Walking or riding your bike to get places rather than driving to them will give you more time to think. If you think too much on the road, something dangerous is bound to happen. Walking to places is a great alternative to driving not only for your body but for your mind, and this, to me, is a strong advantage of limiting car usage.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is you will start to save money. Gas bills start to add up, especially considering the constant inclination of prices. Not only gas, though, but other costly needs such as getting your car's oil changed or tires replaced can also turn out to be expensive. Cost plays a huge role in whether or not teens and young adults will get a car when legally eligible. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license"", Source 4. A large amount of teens just now getting their licenses are unemployed, making the car expenses impossible for them to pay on their own, making them rely on usually a parent or relative. Money has always had a significant effect on how people transport from one place to another. Limiting driving all together would save you gas and repair money, and saving money could never be a bad thing.

Finally, a significant advantage of not driving as much is that it would limit the amount of air pollution on this earth. ""...a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe"", Source 1. Though we may not notice it, air pollution is constantly contaminating the earth. Air pollution is extremely harmful to inhale, almost like how smoking is extremely bad for your lungs. Reducing the amount of driving that we do would reduce the amount of air pollution we produce with it. Walking or biking does not pollute the earth the way driving can.

Advantages of limiting car usage are not only good for the environment but are good for us both physically, mentally, and financially. If everyone started to limit the amount of time they spend driving per day, just imagine the change we might start to see in the community. We could start by walking to the grocery store or our friends' houses instead of driving, and then maybe bring on a longterm change, such as walking to school if it's close enough, or walking to the bus stop so you can ride the bus with other kids instead of driving your own car, creating more air pollution. There are other advantages to limiting car usage, but these are the top three advantages we will begin to notice if we act soon enough.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. After careful consideration of various viewpoints, I believe that we should continue to retain the Electoral College system rather than changing to a popular vote system. 

One of the main reasons for my stance is the certainty of outcome that the Electoral College system provides. As stated in the passage, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the president is elected with a clear majority, avoiding potential disputes or run-off elections. In contrast, with a direct popular vote, it is possible for a candidate to win with just a plurality, which could lead to a fragmented and divided presidency.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate has to appeal to voters from various regions of the country, rather than just focusing on heavily populated areas. This promotes a more balanced representation and prevents candidates from neglecting the interests of certain regions. It ensures that the president is accountable to a broader range of citizens and can act in the best interests of the entire nation.

The Electoral College system also gives importance to swing states. These states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain, receive more attention from candidates during campaigns. This means that voters in swing states are more likely to be well-informed and engaged in the election process. They play a crucial role in deciding the election, leading to more thoughtful and informed voting. This is in contrast to a direct popular vote system, where candidates may focus solely on densely populated areas, potentially leaving out the voices of voters in less populous regions.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of big states and small states. The Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate already gives large states less representation compared to small states. The Electoral College helps restore some of the weight to larger states by awarding more electoral votes to states with larger populations. This ensures that candidates must pay attention to the concerns and issues faced by citizens in both large and small states.

While there are arguments in favor of a direct popular vote, such as claims of unfairness and lack of involvement for voters in non-competitive states, I believe that the advantages of the Electoral College system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides stability, promotes a balanced representation, encourages engagement in swing states, and balances the influence of big and small states.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College system when making any decisions regarding the election process for the President of the United States. I believe that this system best serves the needs of our nation and ensures a fair and representative outcome.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the current electoral process for the election of the President of the United States. Specifically, I want to discuss the importance of keeping the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. After reading and analyzing several sources on the topic, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained due to its practical advantages and ability to ensure a fair and representative election.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College, as outlined in the passage from the Office of the Federal Register, is the certainty of outcome (Posner, 2016, p. 18). By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate has broad support across various regions of the country (Posner, 2016, p. 19). This is crucial to maintaining a diverse and inclusive democracy, as it prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas while neglecting the interests and needs of less populous states and regions (Posner, 2016, p. 21).

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president"" by encouraging candidates to appeal to voters from different regions and not just concentrate on swing states (Posner, 2016, p. 19). This helps to prevent regional biases and ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just particular regions. It also avoids the potential for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process and may not necessarily result in a clear winner (Posner, 2016, p. 22).

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages campaigns to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is less predictable (Posner, 2016, p. 20). This promotes voter engagement and participation, as voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and listen to the competing candidates (Posner, 2016, p. 20). By giving greater attention to swing states, candidates can better understand and address the concerns of a wider range of voters, leading to a more representative outcome.

While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the notion that it may increase voter turnout, these arguments do not outweigh the advantages of the Electoral College system (Plumer, 2016, p. 13). In fact, the Electoral College ensures that elections can be decided with relative certainty and prevents scenarios where a slight plurality of votes can result in a contested outcome (Posner, 2016, p. 18). This helps to uphold the integrity of the election process and maintain public trust and confidence in the system.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the practical advantages of the Electoral College system, as outlined in the texts provided. By maintaining the Electoral College, we can ensure fair representation, prevent regional biases, and promote voter engagement across the nation. While improvements can be made to the system, I believe that completely abandoning the Electoral College would be a disservice to the principles of our democracy. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College: A System Worth Retaining

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for the Electoral College system or, at the very least, the need to consider the advantages it offers before making any decision regarding a potential change to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided by various sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is crucial for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite its flaws in the past, such as the 2000 election, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents any prolonged disputes over the election outcome and provides a clear path towards determining the winner of the presidency. In contrast, if we were to switch to a popular vote system, a dispute over the results would be much more likely, as seen by historical examples.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in electing the president. This system encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal and prevents regional favorites from dominating the election. By requiring candidates to focus on swing states, the Electoral College guarantees that the interests of different regions are considered. Moreover, it promotes candidates who can effectively represent the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a specific region.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that big states do not dominate the election process. By awarding electoral votes based on the size of the state's population, it balances the political power between large and small states. A victory in a closely contested large state, such as Florida, carries more weight in the Electoral College, which encourages candidates to pay attention to the needs and concerns of voters in those states. This ensures a more balanced representation of the interests of both small and large states.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This is particularly important as run-off elections would complicate the process and create additional challenges. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College enables a smoother and more efficient presidential election process.

Lastly, maintaining the Electoral College does not discourage voters who believe their vote may not directly impact the election outcome. Research suggests that voters in presidential elections are more interested in expressing their political preferences rather than considering their individual vote as a deciding factor. Moreover, the Electoral College still drives a significant number of eligible American citizens to participate in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, although imperfect, plays a vital role in ensuring a fair and balanced presidential election process. Its benefits, such as providing certainty of outcome, representing the interests of diverse regions, preventing dominance by big states, and avoiding run-off elections, make it a system worth retaining. I urge you to consider these advantages before making any decisions regarding potential changes to the Electoral College or a switch to a popular vote system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons before forming a stance on this important matter. I look forward to your continued efforts in serving our state and our nation effectively.

"When cars were first introduced into society it was the most awestruck phenomenon to occur. There was nothing better than the sight of a person's first car and the feeling of independence that came with it. But now that technology has shorten distances between countries and has made telecommunication so much more accessible. People should engage in limiting their car usage because it betters personal health, improves the environment, and leads to economic prosperity while still gaining all the benefits that come from using a car.

When the usage of cars is limited it often leads to better health benefits. This is true because when people are restricted on their driving it forces them to resort to healthier, more proactive alternatives. For example, instead of driving somewhere people are now having to get out and walk or ride a bike. This leads to regular exercise without having to think about it and decreases overall stress levels. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" Heidrum Walter, a media trainer and mother of two explained, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way"". Heidrum, a citizen of the Vauban community in which everyone has given up their cars, describes how the nonusage of cars has bettered her life and in turn has actually made her a happier person. In addition, when a high usage of cars is present it creates brutal smog that can perpetuate health issues. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Robert Duffer states how congestion lead to smog in Beijing in which he states ""Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The impact of this is that when people are more active and choose not to exasterbate their driving usage, it will lead to global decreases in smog and in fat related illnesses such as obesity, high blood plessure, diabetes, and other various things that have plagued the nation and taken the lives of so many people.

Limiting Motor Vehicles usage reduces the amount of carbon emissions and pollution in the air. Cars exert so much greenhouse gas emissions that degrades the air in the environment.In the article ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" Elisabeth Rosenthal gives the analogy that, ""...an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middles class are choking cities"". Elisabeth Rosenthal further quantifies the extent to which cars have increasing become the culprit of pollution, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"". The impact of this is that when cars are used less often it betters the environment which is what mankind relies on for survival.

An increase in a healthy workforce and better environmental communities leads to greater economic prosperity. When people choose to drive less it often creates a riple effect. This is true because a healthier workforce is present it leads to more productivity. In addition, a more prosperous environment and less pollution exerted decreases operational costs. As a result Andrew Selsky in his article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" explains the various economic effects that less car usage has made, ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city.....and new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up"". The impact of this is that with more economic leverage communities are more equipped to invest and strengthen other areas such as education and job creation.

In conclusion, people should limit their driving andor car usage because it provides three benefits. First, when people have to resort to proactive alternatives it improves their person health and decreases stress levels. Second, not using cars eliminates all the environmental harms that come from a car such as greenhouse gas emissions. And lastly, when people are more active and the environment is no longer depleted, communities experience greater economic longevity.",0
"Limiting car usage has so many benefits to give us. It can even lead to saving the world. We've lived without them before so it's not the end of the world if they are gone for even just a day.

First of all, cars are responsible for pollutionnot all in the atmosphere such as the greenhouse gas emissions. According to Source 1, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. That is basically saying that having cars as often as we use them is harming the earth through their gas emissions. That cars are responsible for a certain percentage in the pollution.

Additionally, let us see about the few polluted cities or capitals such as Paris. They almost achieved a new record for pollution! But the way they are handling it is quite successful. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Source 2This gives them a chance to reduce significantly the pollution by half if the license plates ratio were balanced. They are taking turns in car usage and lowering pollution and it's a great bill or law to help reduce the pollution. They needed that because according to Source 2, last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found. That's a lot of pollution they have been carrying. But "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Furthermore, there's more benefits of reducing or limiting car usage. In BOGATA, Colombia, they have a Day Without Cars and it's starting to spread to other communities as well. They want to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and those that violates will face 25 fines. This sounds like a very great and effective idea. Many people are participating in it and not only that ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""Source 3 In conclusion, limiting car usage will give us a greater advantage not only in our businesses but also our air. Reducing pollution is just the start of it, imagine many more benefits are there to come if we keep up with these conservative efforts.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system or, alternatively, to explore the possibility of transitioning to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the viewpoints presented in multiple texts, I believe that both systems have their merits, and it is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each.

The current Electoral College system, as explained by the Office of the Federal Register (""What Is the Electoral College?""), provides a fair and reliable method for electing the President. Firstly, it ensures certainty of outcome by requiring the winning candidate to obtain a majority of electoral votes. This means that the elected President must have broad support from across the country, rather than relying solely on a popular vote plurality. Furthermore, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electors promotes the idea of ""everyone's President,"" as individuals from various regions have a say in the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner (""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""). By focusing their efforts in these states, candidates are compelled to address issues that may otherwise go overlooked. This ensures that a wider range of concerns are taken into account during the campaign and potentially in the governance of the country.

The Electoral College also protects the interests of smaller states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states can have their political weight balanced by the Electoral College. This allows candidates to give attention to the needs and concerns of citizens in these states, preventing the dominance of a few populous states over the others.

On the other hand, the argument put forth by Bradford Plumer (""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"") emphasizes the need for change. Plumer contends that the electoral college is unfair to voters, as candidates often prioritize swing states and neglect others. This leads to an imbalance of attention, where only a few states have a significant role in shaping the outcome of the election. However, it is important to recognize that this issue can be addressed by reforming the current system, such as implementing a proportional representation method like that practiced in Maine and Nebraska.

While some critics of the Electoral College, like Plumer and the Gallup poll respondents cited in his text, argue for its abolition in favor of a popular vote, we must consider the potential risks and complications involved. As Judge Posner points out, a direct popular vote could lead to a run-off election if no candidate receives a majority, which would significantly complicate the election process. Moreover, a popular vote system would require careful consideration to ensure that the voices and interests of smaller states are adequately represented and balanced against those of more populous states.

In conclusion, it is essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and a direct popular vote system. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it provides a level of certainty, encourages a trans-regional appeal in candidates, promotes attention to swing states, allows for balanced representation of smaller states, and avoids run-off elections. However, reforms should be considered to address its shortcomings, such as implementing a proportional representation method and ensuring the needs of all citizens are taken into account.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of our state and the nation as a whole.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear State Senator, it is more favorable to keep the splendid method of the Electoral College and not to change it to election by popular vote for the United States President. The Electoral College method is more preferable because it helps to avoid runoff elections, and less numerical values.

Using the Electoral College to vote is more efficient because of it's aid to avoid runoff elections. As Richard A. Posner states,"" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" It also can help candidates running for president to avoid going to states that they know whose vote will have no effect. For example, Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California or how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college. There isn't even any pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority vote that was cast leading to a clear winner.

Furthermore, using the Electoral College to select the President can help to reduce numerical values. Even though a citizen's vote doesn't automatically go to the candidate running for office and actually selects the electors that will select the President, the amount of votes it reduced greatly. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, rather than a estimate of 500 million votes total. Only a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a President. This includes one for each member in the House of Representatives and two for Senators. With most states having a winnertakeall system it even more so reduces the numerical value to that of just electors to vote for the winning presidential candidate while voters in tossup states are more likely to pay closer attention to the campaign. Those voters are more likely to be more thoughtful on average. They also receive the most information and attention from candidates.

Although, some articles and people consider the Electoral College method to be unfair to voters. Bradford Plumer says,""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" Even so, knowing their vote will have no effect, they will have kess incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to be picked by popular vote.

Continuing, as was said before to the State Senator, it's a much more favorable idea to forward with the Electoral College method rather than popular vote because it will help avoid many timeconsuming problems like runoff elections and high numerical values.",0

"Dear state senator, The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. I say this because, as successful as the Electoral College has been, it has many flaws. In the first sentence of the eleventh paragraph, the article mentions something called the disaster factor. This is an alarming possibility. State legislatures are, in a way, responsible for choosing electors who may ignore the will of the people.

During 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, people titled Segregationists almost succeeded in removing the Democratic electors and replacing them with new electors. These new electors were supposed to oppose John F. Kennedy so that any popular votes for Kennedy would not have really gone to him. If those Segregationists had succeeded in their plan, John F. Kennedy would not have won the popular vote. That was indeed a close call, and it could happen yet again in the near future without fail. On another similar topic, ""faithless"" electors have, from time to time, denied the option to vote for their party's candidate. Instead of voting for the candidate of their own party, they cast a vote for whomever they wish.

Also occurring in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. Thankfully, he was presiding over the Senate at the time. He made sure to validate the slate of his choosing ""without establishing a precedent."", as stated in paragraph eleven, sentence 9. Hopefully, this will not occur again anytime soon.

The most worrying occurrence would be a tie. However, if a tie were to happen in an electoral vote, the election would be thrown towards the House of Representatives. There, the state delegations vote on the president. In 1976, a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters from Hawaii had voted the other way. This is bad because the election is only a few voters away from a distaster. In conclusion, the Electoral College is not only unfair, but outdated and irrational. It should be shifted from the way it is now to total amount of popular votes for the president of the United States.",0
"Our country, the United States of America, needs and deserves a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizens of this country to persevere like our forefathers have and this president needs to be voted by popular vote by hisher citizens in the United States. The presidential elections need to be of popular vote and to be voted by the citizens of America, not by some electoral college. The reason for this is that for one: the candidates ignore the smaller states, two: electors who are chosen can, and possibly will, go against the will of the people the Electoral College shows signs of inequality amongst the states, unpatrioticism, and unfairness.

If we continue to go by the electoral college, the smaller states who hold inadequate populations will continue to be ignored by the candidates running for presidency. In source 1 paragraph No. 3, it states:""Your states allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives and 2 for your Senators."" Also, in paragraph 13 of Source No.2, it states,"" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" So, the candidates ignore the smaller states because of their smaller population and this is a sign of unfairness and inequality amongst the people of America. The future president should address and obtain votes that are from all 50 states of the United States. That is how we treat and show that every person and every state are equal to one another, and that the candidates get an honest and fair vote. The way the Electoral College does things during the presidential election is everything against how our country came to be through hardwork, a desire and wish to be equal to one another, and to ensure fairness amongst the people this Electoral College projects an unpatriotic feel and that itself should not be a process that the United States holds.

The Electoral College is unfair in the fact that the electors chosen by our state legislature can, and possibly will go against the will of the people. With the Electoral College those who vote aren't actually voting for the president but for a slate of electors that elect the president. In Source No.2 paragraph 11, it states: ""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This is unfair and a disrespect to a persons choice. It is an act that is untrustworthy and it could happen at any time, people might not even know it. That action practically takes away a citizens right of opinion speech which is part of the Bill of Rights, the very basis of what we have a right to have. That in itself is unAmerican and unpatriotic. This system should be overruled and abandoned for it doesn't go with the basis of our country's ways.

However, the Electoral College does have a somewhat strict rule that is rarely broken. In Source No.3 paragraph 16, it states:"" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for that party's nominee and that trust is rarely broken.."" The Electoral College does have some points that it is not totally untrustworthy. But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people.

Senator, I hope these points have shown that the Electoral College needs to be voted against due to its unfairness, unpatrioticness, and its act of inequality amongst the states. This country needs it's people to vote for it's president, not a slate of electors.",0
"The meaning of a democracy is that the people vote for their leader or president. The electoral college denys that right and that is why the state senator should change that. Not only do the popular votes barley make a difference but, with the electoral college in play the representatives vote for our president, not us. If popular vote was the way the president was elected the elections would be fair.

To start with, how can we live in a democracy were the people do not pick their own president but, some representatives we supposedly chose can. If we were allowed to choose our own president then we could at least feel right in what we chose and not what the representatives did. according to Bradford Plumer the electoral college is unfair due to the winner take all method which basically states that if you are a big state and have many representatives then you will have a majority of a say when it comes to voting. I it were only up to the people to vote then every single vote would count more towards the winning president and not towards the representatives. If the electoral college would keep on then even if the popular vote went for one of the representatives the electoral vote would decide the actual winner.

Also, according to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This imply that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected. Most Americans do not know that they are voting for representatives who in turn vote for the president making this unfair. Thats just another reason why the electoral college is outdated and not needed.

Although the popular vote system is a little bias and favors the president the citizens like the most, it can also prove more effected for the fact that there will always be a winner no matter what. The popular votes system cant be represented by most states like the electoral college does but, it does have the vote of the entire country as opposed to a few states with more representatives.

In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for there president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.",0
"Dear Senator, I feel that we should change using the Electoral college. The popular vote is much more effective. Using the popular vote to decide who becomes president would show who the citizens of the united states want. The popular vote shows what each state has voted for, using the Electoral college takes the right away for the people being able to vote for the president that they favor. Instead of using what the people voted for they come together to chose the candidate they predict would be the best and do the most for the country and that's not fair. If voting is important to this country then congress should understand that when the poeple vote for something everyone wants it to be their decisions that makes one of the two candidates become president not who the Electoral college believes would be best. If we could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote.

Although some citizens believe that the Electoral college is a good idea. I feel that if they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote during voting periods they would feel they system is more efficient. One example is big states could make a tremendous impact on which candidate wins the election. These states have more people with more opinions that should be used during the time of the election for the president.

Some of the problems with the Electoral college is not only do voters not vote for their president, Back in 1960 "" The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Deomcratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy"". ""In that same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" That is not what we are promised as a country. It states that the electoral college is suppose to cast a vote on what their state wants and what their state has chosen. That year the right to do so was taken away. Voting is a serious matter. Popular vote would clearifiy what each states popular favor is, who they want, and which candidate their vote was to be casted for.

I hope with all the information that I have just provided you with above will help to show you that the popular vote isn't only what most people want it's also the better choice.",0
"Recently, in many countries around the world, there have been actions made towards the reduction or complete banishment of most automobiles in order to help advance society. In Paris, there was a law enacted forcing drivers to leave their cars at home every other day. A majority of the reasoning behind such a ban was the pollution that were constantly emitted into the atmosphere. This is not only accepted by the general public, but some even say that their stress was much lower than with automobiles in daily life.

The people who give up their vehicles to live in Vauban, Germany report having less stress than when they did use cars as daily transportation. As stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer who lives in Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In this experimental suburban community, places to park a car are forbidden in most areas. They go as far as to rid of all driveways and parking lots in the community. This creates more spaces or businesses to operate, causing all stores to be built closer to households. This in turn makes getting to and from places faster and safer. The people in Paris also prefer the decreased amount of vehicles during rush hour, which alleviates their stress tremendously when navigating the city. This has affected less major cities also, such as Bogota. Their annual carfree day has lead to the construction of over 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the longest amount in any Latin country. Not only that, but other recreational activity centers have also emerged throughout the city, according the mayor of Bogota.

Pollution has had a large impact in large, carintensified cities like Paris, which was, at some points, comparable to places with the most pollution. The smog eventually resided, but some aspects of the ban still remained. The cars there typically use diesel over gasoline due to tax policies that prefer it specifically. Thus, about two thirds of the vehicles in France prefer diesel engines, which are to blame for the smog that engulfed Paris. According the New York Times, Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for twelve percent of the total greenhouse emissions. The percentage in the United States is over four times that in some congested areas.

The cities of Paris, Vauban, and Bogota are few of the many global areas that have taken on the challenge of removing cars from their daily lives, which has benefited both their health and their environment. This is a part of the longterm shift in our societies' way of commuting from one place to another. The amount of people going to get driver licesnses has been on a decline since 2005 in the United States, and is projected the continue that path for a long time. In fact, there was a twenty three percent decrease in young poeple driving form 2001 to 2009. People are alreading seeing the benefits of decreasing the use of cars, and the amount of traffic is only going to keep decreasing. As a local businessman in Bogota said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my perspective on the continuation of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of various viewpoints, I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College rather than switch to a popular vote system. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the Electoral College presents several advantages that should be considered in this matter.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike the popular vote, where disputes and recounts may occur, the Electoral College system minimizes the likelihood of such situations. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a significant portion of the electoral votes compared to his popular vote share. The winner-take-all basis of electoral votes in most states allows for clear victory margins and reduces the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which would then necessitate a decision by the House of Representatives.

Secondly, the Electoral College system promotes the representation of all regions across the United States. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency, candidates are encouraged to appeal to voters across the country. This requirement ensures that a president has trans-regional appeal and avoids the possibility of a candidate with only regional support being elected. It also prevents voters from feeling disenfranchised and reinforces the notion that the president represents all Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states. In a closely contested election, candidates concentrate on states where the outcome is uncertain, thereby encouraging voters in these states to carefully evaluate the candidates and their policies. This process leads to more informed voting decisions and allows swing state voters to play a crucial role in shaping the election's outcome. By giving thoughtful voters greater influence, we ensure that the most impactful and informed choices are being made.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed by the Constitution, often results in large states losing relative political weight. However, the Electoral College restores some of that balance by allocating electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress. This approach ensures that presidential candidates must pay attention to the concerns and interests of voters in both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College system avoids the challenges associated with run-off elections and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While there are those who argue against the Electoral College, citing concerns over fairness and representation, it is important to note that nearly half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not swing the national outcome. This demonstrates that voters participate to express their political preferences rather than purely to affect the election's result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several key advantages that outweigh the arguments in favor of a popular vote. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages voter engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. While the system has its flaws, it has stood the test of time and continues to be a fair and effective method for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I believe that retaining the Electoral College is in the best interest of our democracy and the United States as a whole. I hope you will carefully consider the advantages it offers and take them into account when addressing any proposed changes to our election system.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the reasons why it should be maintained as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several important benefits that protect the interests of all Americans.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the Electoral College provides a clear winner by requiring the winning candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes. This system prevents the possibility of prolonged legal battles and instability that could arise if the popular vote were the sole determining factor. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of disputes.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's President. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College discourages candidates from solely focusing on the regions with the largest populations. This is crucial for ensuring that the President represents the interests of all Americans and not just those in densely populated areas. As a result, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced and inclusive democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives smaller states a voice in the election process. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes provides smaller states with a greater say in the outcome of the presidential election. This is especially important because large states already have more influence in Congress due to their greater representation in both the House and the Senate. The Electoral College helps restore some balance to the political power dynamics, ensuring that the concerns and interests of Americans in all states are taken into account.

Additionally, the Electoral College allows for greater focus on swing states. The winner-take-all system incentivizes candidates to campaign and engage with voters in swing states, as these states are often decisive in determining the outcome of the election. This ensures that voters in these states receive more attention from candidates and have a greater opportunity to influence the election. Without the Electoral College, candidates would not have the same motivation to campaign extensively in all states, leading to a potential disenfranchisement of voters in non-swing states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. Unlike a popular vote system, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, thereby avoiding the need for run-off elections. This helps streamline the election process and reduces the likelihood of prolonged uncertainty or political stalemates that could arise from not having a majority winner. The Electoral College provides stability and efficiency in the presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves an important role in maintaining a fair and effective method for choosing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers unique benefits that protect the interests and voices of all Americans. I urge you to consider these reasons before making any changes to our current election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives of your constituents when making decisions regarding the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable and accessible communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on air quality. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, with emissions from tailpipes contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and smog. For example, in Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and improve air quality for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities, traffic congestion is a major problem that leads to wasted time and increased stress for commuters. By promoting alternative transportation options such as public transit, biking, and walking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and alleviate traffic congestion. This not only saves time for individuals but also leads to more efficient transportation systems for everyone.

In addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can also create more sustainable and accessible communities. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, car ownership is allowed but parking spaces are limited. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and the community has become more compact and accessible to public transportation. This model has been adopted in other places around the world, where stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for long drives to malls along highways. By designing communities with a focus on alternative transportation options, we can create more livable and sustainable neighborhoods.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have long-term cultural shifts and encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. By promoting walking, biking, and using public transportation, individuals have opportunities to exercise and incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can have positive effects on public health, reducing rates of obesity and related diseases.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can significantly benefit individuals and the environment. By reducing air pollution, alleviating traffic congestion, and creating more sustainable and accessible communities, we can improve our quality of life and create a healthier and more sustainable future. It is essential for individuals and governments to prioritize alternative transportation options and work towards limiting car usage for the well-being of our society.",1

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and highlight its significance in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College, rather than changing to a popular vote system, is crucial for preserving the principles that the founding fathers had in mind when designing our electoral system.

The Electoral College was introduced by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a minimum of 270 electoral votes required for a candidate to win the presidency (Office of the Federal Register). This system ensures that there is a balance of power between states and prevents larger states from dominating the election process. 

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its certainty of outcome. While disputes over the outcome are possible, they are less likely compared to a popular vote system (Posner). This is because the winner-take-all system used by most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory for even a slight plurality in a state (Posner). The winner's share of the electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, making it highly unlikely for a tie in the nationwide electoral vote (Posner).

Furthermore, the Electoral College guarantees that every region of the country has a say in the election of the President. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, preventing candidates with only regional appeal from focusing solely on specific areas (Posner). This ensures that the elected President represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a select few.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. The winner-take-all method used to award electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these swing states (Posner). This leads to a more engaged and informed electorate in those states, as voters know their decision holds significant weight in deciding the election (Posner).

Additionally, the Electoral College restores political balance by providing more weight to large states that may have otherwise been overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate (Posner). It ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of citizens in large states, preventing their voices from being drowned out by smaller states (Posner).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast (Posner). By producing a clear winner, the Electoral College simplifies the election process and reduces the complexity associated with run-off elections (Posner).

It is important to note that while critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters from states that are traditionally dominated by one party, voter turnout in presidential elections remains relatively high (Posner). People vote to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation that their vote may be decisive in a national election (Posner).

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be an essential part of our democracy. Its preservation ensures that the principles of our founding fathers are upheld, protecting the interests of both large and small states. By preventing the domination of a few populous states, the Electoral College allows for a more balanced and representative election of the President. Therefore, I urge you to support the Electoral College and oppose any attempts to replace it with a popular vote system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in your wise judgment and dedication to serving the best interests of the people you represent. I look forward to your continued support for the important principles and values that make our democratic system strong.

Sincerely,

"Dear, State Senator I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people. They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for himher. I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair. The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president. If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the original electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him. The peoples vote would'nt matter. This situation happened in the twothousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more individual votes than electoral votes. This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it. If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states. In the electoral system, each state has a winnertakeall system. When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him. This can cause mayhem, the noncounted votes can make a big difference in the election. In nineteenseventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side. The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates. The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote. Each elector equals each member in your states House Of representatives and add two for the senate. California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000. Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55. This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors. The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true.

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government. The electoral vote crisis in twothousand rarely happens. This situation has'nt happened since eighteeneighty eight, its a rare occurance. Electoral votes also make the playing field even. If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states. The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced. Even so they even out the playing field and the occurrence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eighteeneighty eight and two thousand. If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can lead to numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The idea of reducing car dependence is gaining traction worldwide, as seen in examples from Germany, France, and Colombia. By implementing measures like car-free districts, driving bans, and car-free days, these countries have successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased traffic congestion, and improved overall quality of life. These examples demonstrate the potential benefits of limiting car usage, including increased physical activity, improved air quality, and the promotion of sustainable and accessible transportation options.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity and improved health. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is discouraged and alternative transportation options are emphasized, 70% of families do not own cars. This means that residents rely on walking, biking, or public transportation to meet their daily needs. This change in behavior has led to increased physical activity, which in turn promotes better health and well-being. Moreover, car-free districts like Vauban create spaces where people can walk and bike safely, leading to a more active lifestyle for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. According to a study mentioned in the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing measures such as driving bans in Paris and car-free days in Bogota, cities are able to address the issue of air pollution caused by cars. These temporary restrictions on car usage result in decreased traffic congestion and reduced emissions, leading to cleaner air and a healthier environment for residents.

In addition, limiting car usage can contribute to the promotion of sustainable and accessible transportation options. The development of car-free districts, like Vauban in Germany, encourages the placement of essential amenities, such as stores and services, within walking or biking distance. This concept of ""smart planning"" aims to create more compact and accessible suburban communities, reducing the need for long-distance car trips. By providing alternatives to car ownership and promoting public transportation, these communities become more sustainable and accessible to all residents, including those who do not own cars.

While limiting car usage may seem challenging in areas where car culture is deeply ingrained, there is evidence to suggest that the trend of reduced car ownership and driving is already occurring in some regions. Research indicates that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior has been observed in various age groups, including young adults and older individuals. Factors such as the rise of digital connectivity, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of car-sharing programs have contributed to the decrease in car dependency. With ongoing changes in behavior and attitudes toward car ownership, it is possible that the trend of reduced car usage will continue, bringing along with it the associated benefits of reduced emissions and increased accessibility.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers various advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. Examples from Germany, France, and Colombia demonstrate the positive outcomes of measures such as car-free districts, driving bans, and car-free days. These initiatives promote physical activity, improve air quality, and enhance access to sustainable transportation options. Additionally, trends in reduced car ownership and driving suggest that limiting car usage is not only feasible but also desirable in the pursuit of a more sustainable and accessible future. It is imperative that individuals, communities, and policymakers continue to explore and implement strategies that promote a reduced reliance on cars and encourage alternative modes of transportation.",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards limiting car usage in various cities around the world. This movement is driven by the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable communities. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous, ranging from environmental benefits to improved quality of life for residents.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Automobiles are a major source of these emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. In cities like Paris, where driving bans have been implemented to combat smog, there has been a noticeable decrease in air pollution. The passage states that congestion was down 60 percent in Paris after a five-day ban on driving, and the smog level decreased significantly. This improvement in air quality has immediate health benefits for residents, as poor air quality is linked to respiratory illnesses and other health issues.

In addition to the environmental advantages, limiting car usage can also enhance the quality of life for residents. The passage from the German suburb of Vauban provides an example of the positive impact of car-free living. In Vauban, streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where public transportation runs. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban’s families do not own cars. Residents report feeling happier and less stressed without the constant presence of cars. Walkable streets, fewer traffic accidents, and reduced noise pollution are some of the benefits that contribute to an improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation options. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can invest in public transportation systems, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and bike-sharing programs. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides residents with more options for getting around. The passage from Bogota, Colombia, describes a car-free day that promotes alternative transportation and reduces smog. This event has been successful and has prompted other cities to adopt similar initiatives.

While there may be concerns about the economic impact of limiting car usage, the passage suggests that cities and companies are adapting to this cultural shift. For example, car companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies and expanding their product range beyond personal vehicles. This adaptation shows that there are opportunities for economic growth and innovation in a world with limited car usage.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant and varied. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to enhancing the quality of life for residents and promoting alternative transportation options, there are numerous benefits to be gained from limiting car usage. As more cities and communities around the world adopt car-free initiatives, we can move towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Car usage is a major contributing factor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. It is crucial for us to limit our car usage and find alternative transportation methods in order to reduce our impact on the environment. Multiple examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of car-free or low-car suburban living.

One such example is the town of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. Car ownership is allowed, but parking is limited and expensive. As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars. This has had a positive effect on the residents, who report feeling happier and less tense. This experiment in low-car suburban life has led to more compact communities and increased accessibility to public transportation.

Similarly, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution caused by cars. Motorists were ordered to leave their cars at home on certain days based on their license plate numbers. The ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying multiple passengers to encourage greener alternatives.

The concept of a car-free day has also gained popularity in cities like Bogota, Colombia. This day promotes alternative transportation methods such as hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses. Violators are fined to ensure compliance. The program has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting a healthier environment. Other cities have even adopted this idea and implemented their own car-free days.

These examples show that limiting car usage has numerous advantages. Firstly, it helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are a major contributor to these problems, and by finding alternative transportation methods, we can make significant progress in combatting climate change. Secondly, limiting car usage reduces congestion in cities, leading to less traffic and improved traffic flow. This ultimately saves time for commuters and reduces frustration. Finally, promoting alternative transportation methods not only benefits the environment but also encourages a more active and healthier lifestyle.

In conclusion, there are clear advantages to limiting car usage. We can see from examples around the world that low-car or car-free living leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, reduced congestion, and a healthier lifestyle. It is important for us to adopt these ideas and find alternative transportation methods in order to create a more sustainable future.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that it serves an important purpose in our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, although possible, is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have broader appeal and address concerns of voters from different regions. By requiring a candidate to have support from various regions, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president, which would likely result in a feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

The system is also beneficial in focusing campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the text, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on states where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions about their vote. These thoughtful voters, who often receive the most information and attention from the candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states an advantage in terms of representation. By allocating electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores some weight to larger states in the political balance. The popularity of a candidate in a large state can influence the outcome of the election to a greater extent than in a small state, ensuring that the concerns of residents in these larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This eliminates the need for further complicated run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters for candidates who have no hope of carrying their state, the fact remains that a significant portion of the eligible population still votes in presidential elections. People participate not because they believe their single vote will swing the entire election, but because they want to express their political preference.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance of power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made, changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of challenges and unintended consequences. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision.

Sincerely,

"There are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage, like it will help lower green house gases, it will help save money, and its a great way to get exercise.

Don't get me wrong I love driving and all but it's effecting our ecosystem. Just think if one day out of every week we rode our bikes, or we car pooled, or we took the bus think of how much smog would go away. In source 2 it talks about how they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorist with evennumbered licence plates were ordered to leave there cars at home same went for oddnumbered licence plates the following day. With in five days sixty pecent of the smog was cleared. And they only did it for five days, imagine if every city in the world did this once a month. In source one it states that passenger cars are responsible fro twelve percent of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some parts of the United States. In source one it also talks about a city in Germany named Vauban. Vauban is a city that has banned cars. There is a main thoroughfare , where the tram runs to downtown Freiburg, and and a ffew streets on the edge of the community but ther e are only two places to parklarge garages on the outside of town. And it cost 40,000 dollars along witha home. If we had cities like this here in the U.S. it would be so much better and there wouldnt be so much pollution.

By limiting the usage on cars it will help save money. Think if you walked or rode you're bike to work everyday then you wouldnt have to pay for gas. Gas is typically three to four dollars so if you wanted to put thirty gallons of gas in you car it could cost you ninety dollars. Thats a lot of money to spend on gas and thats not even a full tank for some people. Sure if you ride you bike to work everyday you might have to fix it but you're gonna have to fix your car at some point to and bike parts are so much cheaper than car parts so you'd be saving money there too. And if you walked you would'mt have to even worry about fixing your bike. It might take you longer to get to where you need to go but think you'll be saving money and the Earth. You don't even have to ride your bike or walk, you can car pool or take the bus. You still have to pay for the bus but its way cheaper than paying for gas.

If you're limiting your car usage and walking or riding your bike to work everyday, which maens you'll be getting exercise. Most people don't get the exercise they need so by limiting your car usage not only are you helping the environment you're getting the daily exercise you need. Even if you're riding the bus you're gonna have to get to the bus stop some how. And they even have a place to put your bike on the bus so if the bus does'tn take you all the way to where you need to go you can ride your bike the rest of the way.

So limiting your car usage is'nt all that bad. I mean I don't know anyone who does'nt want to help eliminate green house gases, save money and get exercise while doing it.",0
"State Senator, The Electoral College is outdated, and is commonly viewed as anachronism. In this system voters, instead of voting for a president, vote for a slate of electors. The slate of electors if chosen for the statewide election, would go to Congress. At Congress, they would then vote for the President. For many people, it seems understandably unfair.

First off, voters cannot control who their electors vote for. At this point in time, voters have no more of a say in which President is elected they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they do. Most of the times, this is the wrong case.

Second off, many times voters will get confused in who they're voting for. They'll pick out a candidate without knowing much information about them, or what their views are. A random candidate will be chosen for their vote, and most times this tends to come to an unhappy ending. Many times, voters will be disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out.

People claim this tends to be due to the Electoral College.

It would, in terms, be much simpler to change the election to go by popular vote. This would have many benefits on the difficulty of the systems selecting a President, to how people react. By choosing a popular vote, time of the election would be cut slimmer. People wouldn't have to focus on choosing an elector, or their worries that their state electors didn't share their views. It would give our people the chance to vote for the President they want.

In the end, the Electoral College should be abolished and thrown out. It doesn't make sense to keep continuing on this way, when the votes should be up to the people not random electors.",0
""" All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car..."" Now and days alot of countries are limiting car usage to go into a day of free car day, which basically means that no one is allowed to drive their motor running cars for a day. If they disobey the law they will be charge a fine. Its like a when a police officer stops you for passing a red light or for speeding on a no speeding zone. Still these countries are getting advantages over these days because there will be less smog, less traffic, and more people buying bicycles rather than a expensive car.

"" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" one of the advantages for limiting car use is there will be less smog to deal with in the air. this can harm not only us but our environment we live in, which is the air we breath. In france they decide to do a car ban day. The result of this event was that the "" Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"". If someone was brave enough to drive a car than they will be fined 22euro which is 31.

"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters, people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"". Less traffic was on the streets due this ban of cars, which allowed the people with bicycles to go on the streets and ride them. In Bogota,Colombia they also did this ban but they gained more advantages over limiting car usage, only buses and taxis were permitted to drive on the streets. their goal was to promote alternative transportation. Due to this event, parks and sports centers were packed throughout the city, and pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks for the skateboards and bikes.

"" What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn said Micheal siva"". As a result of car ban people have stop buying cars which is atrocious for car companies but at the same time there is a up side to this also and is that people will now walk or ride bicycles to get to where they need. Which also leads to people being more athletic and less people being obese or overweight.

These countries are gaining alot because of these car ban which is good for removing these dark clouds in the air, less traffic, and people riding bicycles rather than cars. Its obviusly that some people think that this rule is selfish or not needed but its helps more than you think it does. And some people are just mad because of what they are getting charged or fine for driving in the streets even though you can't due to the law.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States, as I believe it is a fundamental aspect of our democratic process. While there are arguments to be made for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the popular vote result, as even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral victory. In a democracy, it is crucial to have a clear winner in order to maintain stability and legitimacy in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on their own. As a result, candidates are motivated to campaign across various states and address the concerns of voters from different regions. This helps to prevent the marginalization of certain regions and ensures that the president is a representative of the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system benefits swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states pay closer attention to the candidates and their policies. These voters are often more thoughtful and engaged, which leads to a more informed electorate and a potentially more effective president being elected.

The Electoral College also gives importance to large states. In the United States, the Senate is apportioned in a way that gives smaller states more representation. The Electoral College system helps to balance this by giving larger states more attention from candidates during their campaigns. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are considered when electing the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a run-off election may be necessary. This would complicate the electoral process and create additional uncertainty. The Electoral College system consistently produces a clear winner, making the transition of power smooth and unambiguous.

While some argue that the Electoral College system is unfair to voters, it is important to note that voters in non-swing states still have their voices heard through the selection of electors. Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in different states, ensuring that diverse perspectives and concerns are represented in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, despite its imperfections, remains a crucial aspect of our democratic process. Its advantages in ensuring certainty of outcome, encouraging trans-regional appeal, benefiting swing states, giving importance to large states, and avoiding run-off elections demonstrate its suitability for our nation. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College system for the sake of our democracy and the fair representation of all Americans.

Subject: In Support of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the continued utilization of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for changing to a system of popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College has numerous benefits that warrant its preservation.

First and foremost, the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As proven by historical data, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the national popular vote. This ensures that a single state or region does not have undue influence in electing the President. This principle is crucial to maintaining a fair and equitable democratic process.

Furthermore, the use of the Electoral College ensures that the President is chosen with trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, effectively preventing a candidate with only regional support from assuming office. This requirement encourages presidential candidates to campaign across the nation, taking into consideration the interests and concerns of all American citizens.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes under the Electoral College system also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This increases voter engagement and ensures that candidates dedicate their time and resources to listening and addressing the concerns of voters in these pivotal states. In turn, this leads to a more informed electorate and a greater likelihood of presidential candidates making well-rounded and inclusive decisions.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance in political power between large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states maintain the weight they deserve in the political process. This balance is essential to prevent a tyranny of the majority and to promote fairness and representation across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process. With this system, a clear winner is determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular vote. This ensures stability in the election process and prevents prolonged uncertainty and further division among the American people.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states they deem 'unwinnable,' it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, regardless of the Electoral College system. People vote to express their political preferences, not solely in hopes of swinging a national election with a single vote.

In conclusion, it is clear that the Electoral College provides several advantages that foster a fair and balanced presidential election process. Its ability to produce a clear winner, promote trans-regional appeal, enhance voter engagement, balance political power, and avoid run-off elections make it a valuable institution in our democracy. I urge you to preserve the Electoral College and advocate for its continued use in the selection of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and its citizens.

"Personally, I believe that there are many advantages to limiting usage of a motor vehicle. There would be less air pollution, quicker public transportation, and more social contact.

Firstly, as stated in almost every article the main goal of stopping people from driving their cars was that their was too much air pollution going on throughout these cities. There was a nearrecord days of pollution which made some cities in Europe decide the make partial laws to restrict people from using their cars all the time. Personally I think that is a great idea to stop people from driving cars. People not driving cars all the time benefits everyone because the air pollution would eventually be hazardous to everyone leading to casualties and deaths.

Secondly, public transportation would be so much easier to get around with since there is barely traffic around. Could you imagine how easy it would be to get around using the bus or a taxi since there would be no traffic jams or accidents on the road. Of course since basically no one would have the accessibility to cars there would be much more public transportation but i doubt it would amount up to how many single cars you see on the road.

Also, one article stated that, Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" meaning that all this occurred due to the dramatic change in everyone driving their cars. I believe that this happened as a social thing because of everyone is always alone in their motor vehicle driving past everyone without a word said, rather than walking past a person with a smile on your face and making face to face contact. Usually the parks and sports centers are getting all these people in there because everyone walking or biking would pass by a park and say that they would want to hang out there for a minute since they hadn't been before or just walk in it to check it out since its on the way.

In Conclusion this is what i think of the advantages of limiting car usage. I think its good for the environment, makes public transportation quicker, and makes people more social.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. This trend is becoming more popular around the world, as exemplified by Vauban, a car-free suburb in Germany, and car-free days in cities like Paris and Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars contribute significantly to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, this percentage can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can greatly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of reducing car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. In the car-free suburb of Vauban, for example, residents rely on public transportation, biking, and walking to get around. This not only reduces the dependence on cars but also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle. In cities like Paris and Bogota, car-free days have encouraged people to explore other means of transportation such as buses, taxis, biking, and walking. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also improves air quality and reduces noise pollution.

Additionally, limiting car usage can create more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located in distant malls. This encourages people to walk or bike to their daily needs instead of relying on cars. Similarly, the car-free days in cities like Bogota promote a sense of community and social interaction, as people participate in alternative modes of transportation together.

The trend towards limiting car usage is not only limited to developed countries but is also gaining momentum in developing nations. In countries like Colombia, car-free days are becoming more popular and are spreading to other cities. This shows that reducing car usage is not just a localized solution but a global movement towards sustainable and livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and creating more accessible communities, we can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future. As more cities and communities around the world adopt car-free initiatives, it is clear that this trend is here to stay.",1
"Our population is booming and with it, our car industry. Cars have provided us with multiple pros for example, getting us places more quickly, and transportation of goods and services is more efficient. We have to know though that with every good follows a bad, and our beloved cars might not be as great as we believe them to be! Pollution from cars has affected our environment severely, we have thousands of accidents daily, and we are stressed due to traffic congestion and daily driving. So, limiting car usage could provide us with many advantages because our environment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stressed out.

Our environment has been infected with toxic greenhouse gasses, and carbon emissions which comes from our cars tailpipe. Mixed with rain, the pollution causes a heavy smog making it nearly impossible for people to even see what is right in front of them making it very dangerous. We are now forced to hold days where no one is able to use their own cars because the pollution is so bad. Arturo Plaza explains that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Par 24"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy how much better it is living in a cleaner environment! It is much healthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. She explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drasitcally reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. Par 5"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Everyday we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so why add on any more? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on how other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substancioully. Heirun Walter is a civialian in a town with no car usage. She explains that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. Par 3"" Even though she is a mother of two and a media trainer, she is able to live a life less stressed without her own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard with out them having to worry about the passing cars. Heidrun Walter explains that she can walk down the streets where the sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. Par 3"" We can help ourselves and our environment by limitng our car usage daily! Limiting usage could provide us with many advantages because our environment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stressed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be healthier, and live a better life.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from multiple sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register and ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the method for selecting the President.

Firstly, one of the key reasons for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of the Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide victory for the winning candidate, even with a slight plurality. This ensures a clear and decisive outcome for the presidency.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of everyone's President. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the presidency. This is important because it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions and avoids a situation where certain regions feel disenfranchised.

Thirdly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Plumer highlights in his article that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to appeal to voters in toss-up states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions, thereby ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters play a significant role in deciding the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College restores some of the political balance lost by large states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This means that presidential candidates are more likely to pay attention to large states during their campaigns, as the number of electoral votes a large state offers is significant. This ensures that issues and concerns of states with larger populations are not overshadowed by smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College produces a clear winner, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections that can prolong the election process and further divide the nation.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who feel their votes will have no effect, the fact remains that the Electoral College method continues to encourage voter participation. As Plumer mentions, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preference rather than expecting their single vote to decide the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for electing the President of the United States. The certainty of outcome, the representation of all regions, the focus on swing states, the balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections are all valid reasons to support the Electoral College system. While some argue for direct popular vote, the Electoral College effectively achieves the goals of fairness, representation, and avoiding potential election crises.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the best interest of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator, The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please."" Paragraph 11 Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Paragraph 1 by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media available, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Paragraph 9 Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Paragraph 13 This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" Paragraph 20 Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smallerimpact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" Paragraph 14 Regards, A concerned citizen.",0
"The Electoral College is a system that should no longer be used because it is based on an outdated system from the first years of our country's independence. It would be much more beneficial to use the popular vote as the final vote. One reason is that one candidate can get more votes, but still lose the election! Another is that many states never get to see the potential president speak, as to make their descion. Lastly voting would be easier to count and to understand for citizens and those who work the election.

In 2000, the electoral college failed to properly represent our country's people. More people voted for Al Gore, but Bush still won the election. In the states where Bush did win, it made the people who voted for Al Gore insignificant and their votes would never again be considered. Even if in every state a particular candidate won by one vote, that person would still get every electoral vote, because they won the state, this is mostly an issue in large states. This is unfair to the losing candidate because their voters never really got a chance. If it was a popular vote, voting would be much more direct and easier to understand. Citizens might even be unaware that they aren't really voting for the president, they are voting for their electoral college representative. With popular vote, there would be no more confusion, and no more worrying about comparing the two voting methods.

Another reason is that some states may never get a chance to see their potential president speak. Potential presidents tend to go speak in swing states, or states that may vote either for them or for their opponent, since it is based on the states vote not the individual people. When a president goes to speak in a swing state they are convincing people that it will be a better choice to vote for them, not the other candidate. If somebody lived in Rhode Island, for example, they would never get the chance to see their potential president speak, therefore they would have to make their descion based on television speeches, newspaper articles, etc.

Also states that tend to vote one way or another often do not get visited because there is no point in trying to convince a state to vote for you that is definitley already going to vote you, to vote for you, and vice versa. Swing states with high populations are really the only states that are visited. It is no promise that the potential president will go to every state or even every region, but they will more likely than not visit different states than they would have before. If popular vote decided who would become president, it likely would no longer be true for presidents to only visit swing states.

Last, the entire election process would be much more simplistic. There would be a whole group of people who no longer would have to be a part of the process, and the less people, the less mistakes. Also each state could still add up their votes, then add all the state's votes together and voila, the president has been chosen, by the people. There would be no more arguments as to who really won the election, as in popular vote versus electoral college. Also there would be much less of a chance for a tie, the more numbers the less each number is worth. Overall, the electoral college adds unecessary complications to a potentially simple system.

The popular voting system would still be difficult to take care of, but much better than the previous system, the despised electoral college. Throughout the years we have seen twice where our course of history could have been radically changed, with a different president. The popular vote system would increase the power of the people, allow more people to see the president speak, and get rid of unecessary complications and confusion of the electoral college.",0
"I strongly believe that the Electoral College should remain the way it is or, better yet, that we should elect the president by popular vote. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College does not accurately reflect the will of the people. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, an estimated two million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump however, Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304 to 232. This means that a candidate can win a majority of the Electoral College voters while losing the popular vote! Furthermore, voting for President should be an individual citizen decision, not a state decision. The Electoral College works by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the winner of the majority of votes in the state. This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not receive any of that states electoral votes. This goes against the concept of onepersononevote, since a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not win any electoral votes. By eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote, the votes of every individual will be counted, and the candidate who wins the most votes nationally will win the election. In conclusion, the Electoral College does not reflect the will of the people and votes in state are not equally weighted. It is time to elect the president by popular vote and to finally give the votes of individual citizens the weight they deserve.",1

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the benefits it brings to our democratic process. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the diverse interests of all states.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, serves as a compromise between election of the President by Congress or a purely popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency. The selection of electors is made by the states based on their Congressional representation, ensuring that smaller states have a voice in the election process. 

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. A dispute over the popular vote is more likely to occur than a dispute over the Electoral College's results. The winner-take-all system in most states contributes to this certainty, as even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Additionally, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections, as it invariably produces a clear winner.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the election of a president who has trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to secure a victory, candidates must have broad appeal across different regions of the country. This requirement ensures that the president represents all regions and prioritizes the interests of all Americans, not just a particular region.

The Electoral College system also places attention on swing states, where campaign efforts are concentrated. This focus on key states increases voter engagement in those states and encourages voters to thoroughly evaluate the candidates and their policies. By giving more power to swing states, we ensure that thoughtful and well-informed voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the political weight between large and small states. While the Senate already provides some balance through mal-apportionment, the Electoral College further emphasizes the importance of large states in the political process. Candidates are compelled to pay attention to these states due to their higher number of electoral votes, granting citizens in large states a fair share of influence in presidential elections.

Lastly, abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the representation of states with smaller populations, and candidates would focus solely on populous regions and disregard the concerns of less populated areas. This could exacerbate divisions between urban and rural areas and lead to a concentration of power in heavily populated regions. The Electoral College ensures that the interests of all states, regardless of population size, are taken into account during presidential elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a critical component of our democratic system, striking a delicate balance between the popular vote and the interests of states. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages voter engagement in swing states, provides balance between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider the benefits outlined above when making decisions regarding the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my viewpoint into consideration when evaluating any potential changes to our presidential election process.

Sincerely,

"The Electoral College is not perfect and it may be called broken by some people, but in all truth it isn't. Nothing is perfect. The Electoral College is a good way to make sure that a election won't end in a tie 95% of the time. It also makes sure that certain regions, or states, don't control the vote with their population. The Electoral College can be edited if it needs to though.

The Electoral College is very good at insuring one winner. It has this ability, because to be a tie both candidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikely. To have a President chosen majority has to vote one way 270. Now with a ""winnertakesall"" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beginning of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes.

The Electoral College also makes sure one part of the country does not get favored and make the others feel like their votes did not count. If one candidate is favored in a area and if it has a lot of people then that candidate would win with a direct vote. The bigger cities with more people would get every political ad and the candidates would be more focused there instead of getting everyone's opinion. The other places would feel left out and would be less likely to vote meaning not a true meaning of who majority wants as President.

Nothing is the world is ever made perfect forever. The Electoral College was clearly a great idea when it was made or it would never be put into action. The Electoral College does have slight problems that rarely happen. The best thing about it though is that people could vote and change details about it if it was that big of a deal. As ""Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution,"" people wanted thought it would be fair to count the District of Columbia as a ""state."" So people took a vote to make the change, thats why it is the the 23rd Amendment. When the USA gets more population, for a short time, there will be a odd amount of electoral votes, that means no ties. Until the popluation grows or decreases enough to make a even number of votes again.

There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not.",0
"What is your point of view on this argument that we are discussing today here in the Sunshine State? The Florida Senator should consider keeping the Electoral College voting system to choose our President because the founding fathers of the United States established this system. The popular vote is terrible because in some cases it might be teens or young people that don't know about politics or what they want to give to this country or state. They vote on the things that interest them, not the country. When you vote for anything, your main priority is ""Does this make the country a better place and will bring more benefits to the people in this country or state""?

The Electoral College voting system is much easier to count who won because its a ""winnertakeall"" system. This can be seen when "" The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral vote""Source 3. This example shows even tho the popular was very close, Obama still won Florida and got those 29 electoral votes. There is a another way people view theElectoral College and they say that the ""Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational""Source 2. They also say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor.

Each person has their own point of view about each thing but mine is that we should stay with the Electoral College system because it benefits the people in Florida and the United States.

For example, ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state""Source 3. This shows a certainty of the outcome for that state. This also cause candidates to not spend their time in states ""they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states""Source 2.

Therefore, we should consider keeping the electoral College for various reasons. The Electoral College has been the voting system of our country all along. Why should we change the tradition that our founding fathers left for us? Eveything in life happens for a reason, I would appeciate it if you could the the Electoral College in this beautiful Sunshine State, Florida.",0
"Dear Mr.Mrs. Senator, The Electoral College is a process created by the founding fathers of America to choose a president by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I believe this is not a very effective process. I think that we should go to popular vote because it allows the citizens to have a vote and it is not up to people that alread run our country and it allows the president to be chosen fairly.

To begin with, the electoral college is not a good idea because it allows citizens to have a voice and it is not decided by people that already run our country. If we resorted to this method, there might be a higher voter turn out because the citizens will feel that they really have a say in who runs the country. They won't think that if they vote for one person and they win, that some lousy people in Congress will come in and make a different decision and go against the majority. This will make more and more people want to make a difference in the country. Then we will have more concered citizens and the U.S. will be a better all around country. As stated in Source two, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" That fact is why we should absolutely not have an electoral college. Then if we don't have an electoral college then we will have a higher voter turn out. Then after that, the good ole USA will be a better country than all of the other countries in the world combined except for our health and education. That is just one reason why should not have an electoral college.

Additionally, we should not have an electoral college because it will then allow us to chose the president fairly. With not having the electoral college vote on a president, it would make the voting system more fair and not based on a few people. Then when people try and figure out if they will vote or not, they will think, ""hey, my vote does matter because there is no electoral college to spoil my vote!"" This would make for a much better run country because the citizens have a voice in the government. The only reason a citizen would not vote would be if they were critically injured or they didn't like any of the canidates. This is just one of the many reasons why we should get rid of the electoral college.

In conclusion, we should get rid of the eclectoral college because it would give the citizens more of a voice and it would make the voting process more fair. This would make the government and the country run smoothly and a lot better than if we keep the electoral college.

thank you for your time Mr.Mrs.",0
"Ford, Volkswagen, Kia, and Chevy's... while these car brands may have been a massive part of the American culture, its significance in our lives may be declining. According to recent studies and stories from around the world, car transportation popularity is decreasing dramatically. Some advantages of limiting car usage that the United States will benefit from include: reducing greenhouse gases emitted making for a better environment, and less usage of cars can lower stress and is safer.

By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve. As stated in Source 1, ""and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars. By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly. In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities. ""After days of nearrecord pollution,"" Source 2 says, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that. By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment. ""It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" a sociologist predicts in Source 4. Environmental advantages of reducing greenhouse gas is a major way we can benefit from limiting car usage.

A decent amount of stress comes with owning and operating a motorized vehicle. You are constantly worrying about if you will be late, or if you have enough gas to make it from point A to point B. Children are another concern and trying to keep them safe around roads and driving by themselves. Limiting the use of cars can create a less stressful, and safer society. In Source 3 it explains that, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Lowering the use of cars can make life a little less busy because it is one thing less that you have to worry about throughout your day. Heidrun Walter said, in Source 1, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Reducing the usage of cars can promote a less stressful and safer lifestyle here in the United States.

Although the use of cars may be convienent, the benefits of limiting the usage may be beginning to outweight the inconviences. Between reducing the greenhouse gas creating a cleaner environment as well as lessening stress and making the roads safer, the advantages of limiting car usage in the United States are major.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and the method by which we elect the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of various perspectives, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a popular vote system. 

Firstly, the Electoral College preserves the certainty of outcome and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results. As is evident from past elections, the winner of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a conclusive result. For instance, in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, whereas he only obtained 51.3% of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states also contributes to a landslide electoral victory and mitigates the possibility of a nationwide tie. This certainty is crucial in maintaining stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region possesses enough electoral votes to secure a victory, requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters across multiple states. This trans-regional appeal is vital in selecting a president who can effectively represent the entire nation. If a candidate can only win by dominating a single region, it is unlikely that they will be able to address the needs and concerns of citizens in other regions. The Electoral College helps prevent the potential disenfranchisement of voters and promotes a more balanced representation.

In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the election outcome is uncertain, receive the most attention and resources from candidates. This ultimately benefits voters in those states as they become more engaged in the political process, actively listening to and analyzing the policies put forth by competing candidates. The swing states, with their thoughtful and engaged voters, should rightfully play a significant role in deciding the election and shaping the future of our nation.

The Electoral College also provides a safeguard for the political balance between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives more weight to smaller states in the political process. The Electoral College helps restore some equilibrium by allocating electoral votes based on population size. This ensures that presidential candidates must consider the concerns and issues faced by both large and small states, preventing a disproportionate focus on less populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. The system invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complexities and uncertainties associated with run-off elections. This streamlined process contributes to the stability and efficiency of our electoral system.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, statistics show that approximately half of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections. Voters engage in the political process to express their political preferences, irrespective of the possibility that their vote may swing a national election. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains the most practical and effective method to elect the President of the United States. It provides certainty in outcomes, ensures the consideration of every region, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is imperative that we maintain this system to preserve the stability, fairness, and representative nature of our democracy.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States presidential elections and urge you to consider the benefits it provides to our democracy. While there is an ongoing debate regarding whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democratic process that should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also contributes to this, as even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, minimizing the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents the entire nation. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign and gain support in various regions of the country. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on regions where they are already popular and ensures that they consider the interests of citizens from all regions. It fosters a sense of national unity by giving every region a stake in the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its focus on swing states. In a close election, where the outcome depends on a few states, candidates are more likely to pay attention to and campaign in these swing states. This results in more informed and engaged voters in these states, who carefully evaluate the competing candidates. This heightened attention helps in making thoughtful decisions and serves the democratic process by ensuring that swing state voters have a significant say in the election.

The Electoral College also brings balance to the political influence of large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on the number of congressional representatives and senators, large states have a greater weight in the electoral process. This balance is important as it prevents the interests and concerns of large states from completely overpowering smaller states. Through this system, candidates are incentivized to address the needs of a diverse range of states, not just those with the largest populations.

Finally, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner and avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College guarantees that a clear winner emerges. The pressure for a run-off election, which significantly complicates the election process, is thus diminished. This leads to a more efficient and streamlined election outcome.

While I acknowledge the criticisms against the Electoral College, including the focus on swing states and the potential for a candidate to lose the popular vote but still win the presidency, I believe the benefits outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College maintains a level of stability, promotes national unity, and prevents the political interests of certain regions from dominating the election process.

In conclusion, I strongly believe in the importance and efficacy of the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. It upholds the principles of our democratic system by ensuring a certainty of outcome, representing the entire nation, giving swing states a significant influence, providing balance between large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. I urge you to consider these points and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your support in preserving this vital component of our democracy.

"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. In the passage set, there are examples of communities and cities that have implemented car-free policies and have experienced positive outcomes.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can go up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can play a part in reducing their carbon footprint and mitigating climate change.

Another advantage is the improvement in air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog is a persistent problem, implementing car-free measures can significantly reduce air pollution. For example, after a five-day period of smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Limiting car usage can help reduce the emissions of pollutants that contribute to smog and other respiratory problems.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve quality of life for individuals. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, residents have reported feeling happier and less tense without the need for car ownership. Walking, biking, and using public transportation can contribute to a more active lifestyle and improve physical and mental well-being. It can also create a sense of community as people interact more while walking or cycling through the neighborhood.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient use of space and resources. In Vauban, for example, large garages at the edge of the development serve as the only parking spaces, minimizing the need for streets and driveways. This allows for more green and communal spaces within the community. The concept of limiting car usage also promotes smart planning, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street rather than in distant malls. This decreases the need for large parking areas and encourages a more compact and accessible community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, improved quality of life for individuals, and more efficient use of space and resources. Utilizing alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation can lead to a more sustainable and livable future. By implementing car-free policies and promoting smart planning, communities can contribute to a greener and healthier environment for everyone.",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various cities around the world. This trend is based on the realization that automobiles are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and that reducing car usage is crucial for combating climate change. Three passages highlight the advantages of limiting car usage, including reduced emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life.

The first passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, focuses on the experience of Vauban, a car-free community in Germany. The passage explains that Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free,"" with residents only being allowed to park their cars in large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Residents report feeling happier and less stressed without cars. This example demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life for residents.

The second passage, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, discusses the temporary driving ban imposed in Paris due to smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality in the city. This shows that limiting car usage can have immediate positive effects on air pollution and public health.

The third passage, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, focuses on the success of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. The annual car-free day aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event has been well-received by the public, with millions of Colombians participating by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work. The passage notes that the day without cars is part of a larger improvement campaign in Bogota, which has seen the construction of bicycle paths and the transformation of the cityscape. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and livable cities.

Overall, these passages provide evidence for the advantages of limiting car usage. By reducing car dependency, cities can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance the quality of life for their residents. The movement to limit car usage is gaining momentum worldwide, with initiatives such as car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days. These examples demonstrate that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for the environment but also for public health and well-being. It is clear that embracing alternative forms of transportation and creating more sustainable cities is essential in the fight against climate change.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and argue against changing to a system of election by popular vote for the president of the United States. While there are valid concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the Electoral College, I believe that it is important to consider the practical reasons for keeping this system in place.

One of the key reasons for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Under this system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his or her share of the popular vote. This ensures that the election results are clear and conclusive, reducing the likelihood of disputed outcomes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could result in a close election and potential disputes over recounts and ballots, as seen in the 2000 election.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the idea of ""everyone's president."" This system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal in order to secure enough electoral votes for victory. As a result, candidates are encouraged to campaign in various regions and address a broader range of issues that are important to voters throughout the country. This helps prevent candidates from focusing solely on states where they are likely to win and neglecting the interests of other regions.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. In these states, where the race is highly competitive, voters tend to be more engaged and informed, as they know their vote can have a significant impact on the outcome. By giving greater weight to swing states, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a greater say in determining the election results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states more representation per capita than larger states. The Electoral College restores some balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates, as they have a greater number of electoral votes. This system ensures that the concerns and interests of both large and small states are taken into account during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps streamline the election process and ensures a clear winner. In situations where no candidate wins a majority, a run-off election can be complicated and time-consuming. The Electoral College prevents this by guaranteeing that a candidate obtains a majority of electoral votes.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system and the potential for candidates to ignore certain states, the practical advantages it offers outweigh these concerns. It promotes certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, engages swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. These reasons demonstrate why the Electoral College should be retained for future presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and direct popular vote systems before making any decisions.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as a method to elect the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a necessary compromise that ensures a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

Firstly, the Electoral College offers a certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner must have broad support across different regions, rather than just winning the popular vote in a few densely populated areas. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and encourages them to campaign throughout the country, understanding the concerns and needs of various regions.

Secondly, the Electoral College guarantees that every region and state has a voice in the election process. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which forces candidates to have trans-regional appeal. By requiring candidates to garner support from all parts of the country, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than a few concentrated populations.

Thirdly, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in each state incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. These states, where the race is close and the outcome uncertain, receive the most attention from candidates. This encourages voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign, listen to the competing candidates, and make more informed decisions. The Electoral College promotes engagement and thoughtful voting among citizens.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores balance in the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. The Electoral College balances this by ensuring that larger states receive more attention from candidates. It prevents candidates from solely catering to the interests of densely populated areas and encourages consideration of the concerns and needs of less populous regions as well.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This is particularly important in a diverse and pluralistic society like ours, where establishing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting preserves stability and reduces the complications of the election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters are motivated to express their political preference, not solely to decide an election with a single vote. The Electoral College does not diminish the importance of individual voters but rather ensures that the collective voice of the American people is accurately represented.

In conclusion, the Electoral College strikes a balance between a direct popular vote and election by Congress. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all Americans, encourages engagement and thoughtful voting, balances the power of different states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. It is a fair and effective method to elect the President of the United States.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my view. I trust that you will take this into account when deciding on the future of our electoral system.

Sincerely,

"I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one. I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall. When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likely will vote for the candidate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants.

I mean we people are still voting we still have the vote just that our vote goes to choosing a certain elector instead of just directly leaving it to the people to vote for a certain candidate running for president. By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody heher is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party."" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.

This does make the candidate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candidate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost. It stated in the article that ""A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.""So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for.

I think the Electoral college is great and well organized the process is good and the only thing is does is make the voting process more easier and ordered. I think we should keep it i mean it has had his troubles her and there but it has worked so good for such a long time. We don't want to change it and create choas since a lot of people are not use to change and don't take it quite well. I hope this is the way we keep on voting i think its great and that changing it would just make things harder on everybody.",0
"Dear State Senator, In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaign. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In plumber's article he says,"" thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attention to the votes sent out. according to plumber's article, the Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend around the world as people recognize the many advantages of reducing their reliance on cars. This trend is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals and communities. By implementing smart planning and promoting alternative forms of transportation, societies can experience numerous advantages.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The New York Times article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage is improved air quality. The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" explains how the city of Paris enforced a driving ban in response to severe pollution. This ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. By limiting car usage, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for everyone.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" observes how America's love affair with vehicles is cooling and states that rates of car ownership per household and per person have started to decline. This shift opens up opportunities for new urban planning strategies that prioritize public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Communities like Vauban in Germany are pioneering the concept of car-free living, where streets are designed for walking and cycling. This approach not only reduces traffic but also promotes physical activity and social interaction among residents.

In addition, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The Seattle Times article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" highlights how car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, have led to reduced traffic congestion and increased revenue for delivery companies. By promoting alternative transportation methods and reducing reliance on cars, cities can create more efficient transportation systems and stimulate economic growth.

It is important to recognize that limiting car usage does not necessarily mean eliminating cars altogether. The goal is to find a balance that prioritizes alternative forms of transportation while still accommodating those who require cars for various reasons. As mentioned in the New York Times article ""The End of Car Culture,"" companies like Ford and Mercedes are shifting their focus to become ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles. This shift indicates that the automotive industry recognizes the changing landscape and is adapting to meet the needs of the future.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating more compact and accessible communities, and stimulating economic growth, societies can experience a sustainable and thriving future. It is imperative that we continue to explore innovative solutions and embrace alternative forms of transportation to reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1
"The presidential election is an enormous event that almost all Americans over the age of eighteen participate in. But there is one problem, the system we use for it is outdated, unfair, and just terrible! The electoral college needs to be removed because voters need more power, and there are tons of problems that come with the electoral college.

There are some pretty solid defenses for the United States to keep the electoral college. For example, as stated in in the article by Posner, even though some candidates can dominate regions, ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" But the thing is, even though it might not be enough to win the election, it extremely benefits the candidates race. Another defense states in poster's article is that the trust of the slate of electors that you are actually voting for is ""rarely betrayed."" This is a flawed defense because it shouldn't be rarely betrayed, instead, it shouldn't be betrayed at all!

Since the trust of voters in the slate of electors can't be betrayed, why not put the power in the voters hands instead of people most of the voters have never even met? The voters aren't even voting for the president in the electoral college system, they are voting for a slate of electors. And in the text written by Plumer, that the voters can't even control who they're voting for! Another claim in plumber's article to back the last sentence up is: ""The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" That is just ludicrous! Also, voters quite frequently ""get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates."" That just goes to show one of the extreme amount of problems that the electoral college system has. As stated in plumber's passage, one of the biggest problems the electoral college system has is that ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct electioin to the kind we have now."" But, no one can expect them to listen because, you can clearly tell from their system that they don't care about the common voters opinion, but the direct election system does. In plumber's article, he loosely states that another thing that can go wrong with the system we have now is the state can possibly cheat and send two slates of electors to Congress. It has happened before so who says it can't happen again? ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.""John Plumer Having a tie is just another terrible flaw in the awful electoral college system that the United States runs today.

Most voters can't even have a say in the election if we don't stop running the electoral college system. But, if the U.S. finally smartens up and changes, the presidential election would have much fewer problems and it would put more power in the hands of the people like a democracy should be.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This idea is supported by various articles, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased physical activity.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant cause of climate change. According to the article by Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. In the article by Duffer, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a reduction in particulate matter per cubic meter. Similarly, in Bogota, the car-free day initiative led to a significant decrease in traffic jams and a reduction in smog levels, as mentioned in Selsky's article. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can contribute to cleaner and healthier air for citizens.

Another advantage of reducing car dependency is the promotion of physical activity and healthier lifestyles. When individuals rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transit. This increased physical activity can lead to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle tone, and weight management. As stated in Rosenthal's article, cities like Bogota have seen the construction of miles of bicycle paths, the creation of parks and sports centers, and the replacement of pitted sidewalks with smooth ones. These changes encourage an active lifestyle and contribute to the overall well-being of citizens.

In addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to more efficient transportation systems. In the article by Rosenthal, it is mentioned that Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has stores placed within walking distance on a main street, promoting a compact and accessible layout. This approach reduces the need for large parking lots and encourages the use of public transportation. By adopting similar strategies, communities can improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and make transportation more efficient overall.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. This approach can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased physical activity, and more efficient transportation systems. As highlighted in the articles, various initiatives and experiments worldwide have shown the positive impact of reducing car dependency. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation and promoting smart planning, individuals and communities can contribute to a healthier environment and enhanced quality of life.",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation. This movement is beginning to gain traction in various parts of the world, with examples such as the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris to combat smog, and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. These initiatives provide several advantages to both individuals and society as a whole.

One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are major contributors to air pollution, and they are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. The introduction of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and cycling, can provide more efficient and sustainable ways for people to move around. This can not only reduce the number of cars on the road but also ease the strain on infrastructure and improve overall traffic flow. Furthermore, by promoting walkable communities and placing stores within walking distance, we can reduce the need for long-distance commutes and make neighborhoods more accessible to residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars emit various pollutants, such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to poor air quality and have detrimental health effects. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these pollutants and create cleaner and healthier environments for people to live in.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The cost of owning and maintaining a car can be significant, especially when considering expenses such as fuel, insurance, and parking. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money by using more affordable and sustainable options. Additionally, investing in public transit and cycling infrastructure can create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth.

While the idea of limiting car usage may be met with resistance, it is crucial for society to embrace these changes in order to create a more sustainable future. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the feasibility and positive outcomes of these initiatives. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and providing economic benefits, limiting car usage can lead to a healthier and more sustainable society for future generations.",1
"The Electoral College is a system that must be changed. It is a system that takes away the people's vote in a sense. As it originated from the Founding Fathers, it is as well an outdated system, that could have a drastic overhaul. The Electoral College could be thought of as ruining portions of this democracy, granting the people to vote for a president. There could be great error introduced to such a way of selecting people for such positions. Therefore, I stand vehemently on the side that the Electoral College must change, granting the people and the government a cleaner, more reliable form of election by three contentions: it removes the thought of there being an improper ratio of electoral votes to popular votes it is too easy for fraud to occur in the system and because of how irrational and unfair it is.

The first reason why the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote system is because of how there is such a margin of error introduced in its existence. The opposition may argue that a popular voting system may have equal, if not a greater chance of error, but that is very inaccurate. In a popular voting scenario, things are about as basic as possible. Election results are taken directly from the people of each state, and the results are then combined and compared, in turn selecting someone into office. In contrast, the Electoral College is far more complicated, resulting in more things to go wrong. For instance, a notable example is the 2000 election between Gore and Bush. In this scenario, Gore received a larger number of popular votes, as Bush won the Electoral College. The whole practice of the Electoral College introduces so many variables to the equation, that it would just be very irrational to use such a system.

Continuing, the next reason why the popular voting system should replace the Electoral College is by the chance of ""fraud"" in such a form of election. The members of the Electoral College could be anyone. Now, this may not be thought of as fraud, however it could as well be thought of as fraud of the system. These members of the College could potentially curve the results of an election. For instance, in the 2000 election, members did not stay true to the one candidate, resulting in the possibility for in improper ratio of votes between the Electoral College and the populous. A counter of this argument may be how often this sort of thing may occur. The 2000 election was the first election since 1888 that had a similar problem. However, this sort of thing should never occur. There should never be an occasion of a problem occuring in something as substantial as a presidential election.

My final contention is regarding how irrational and unfair the entire Electoral College is. In this, there is a type of winnertakeall system set in place. This means that, in most states, if a candidate wins the state, they take the Electoral College for the state. Because of this, candidates mainly focus on campaigning in states that they have a clear chance of winning. This is extremely unfair for many voters in the states that these candidates do not even visit. They would have no evidence of what to vote on in election. This could also change an election, with disastrous results. For example, in the 1976 election, a mere few thousand different votes in both Ohio and Hawaii could have led to a tie in the election. Ties are often fatal in the Electoral College system, as delegations in Congress determine a winner of the election. A counter to this claim may be how the winnertakesall system encourages more campaigning in the tossup states, where close attention is set upon the campaigning individuals. However, this still does not change the fact that other states are not receiving the proper amount of campaigning to prove a fair election.

In summation, the Electoral College must be changed in favor of a popular vote form of election by three previously stated contentions. First, it provides the chance for there to be disastrous results in an election. These results may consist of there being a tie, or an improper ratio of popular votes to electoral votes, as seen in the 2000 election. To continue, my second contention is regarding how there is a chance of corruptness and disagreement in an election. With the Electoral College in place, anybody could technically become part of the College, and there may be a dispute between what member is for what candidate and such. This could be very confusing for the voters. And finally, the entire system of the Electoral College is plainly unfair and irrational. This results in the election being unfair to certain states that did not receive proper campaigning for particular candidates, as it allows candidates to choose which states they would like to take part in campaigning with. In all, the Electoral College is a jumbled, confusing mess of election and governmentation.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. As shown in the passages, there are several benefits to implementing measures that reduce the reliance on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to air pollution and climate change. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can reach up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can effectively reduce these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on individuals' well-being. The passages highlight that many residents who have given up their cars in Vauban, Germany, experienced improved quality of life. One resident mentioned feeling less stressed and happier without a car. This can be attributed to various factors, such as reduced traffic congestion, noise pollution, and the promotion of alternative modes of transportation like walking and cycling. These activities not only help individuals stay physically active but also create a more vibrant and connected community.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient land use. Traditional suburban development centered around car use has often resulted in spread-out homes and vast parking areas. These developments contribute to urban sprawl and the loss of green spaces. However, smart planning strategies, as seen in Vauban and other communities, propose more compact and accessible suburbs with less space dedicated to cars. By placing stores and amenities within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, these developments promote sustainable land use and foster a sense of community.

Limiting car usage also supports the development of alternative transportation infrastructure. As highlighted in the passages, there are efforts to improve public transportation systems and make them more accessible to suburban areas. This shift can lead to better public transportation services, reduced traffic congestion, and increased mobility options for individuals who do not own cars. Additionally, it can incentivize the use of greener modes of transportation such as bicycles and electric vehicles.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving individuals' well-being, promoting efficient land use, and developing alternative transportation infrastructure, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is essential to prioritize these measures to address the environmental challenges we face and create a better future for all.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have many advantages for both individuals and communities. The passages provided offer several examples of places where car usage has been limited, and these examples demonstrate the potential benefits of such a change.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By using cars less frequently or not at all, these emissions can be greatly reduced, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and streets are car-free, residents experience less traffic and noise. This creates a more peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, allowing residents to enjoy the natural surroundings and engage in activities like walking and biking. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to reduce smog and congestion. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent.

Limiting car usage can also lead to healthier and more active lifestyles. In Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, residents rely on alternative modes of transportation like walking and biking. This promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior, which can have various health benefits. Additionally, in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. During this day, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This encourages individuals to engage in physical activity and reduces the reliance on cars for daily transportation.

Finally, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and efficient use of space. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for larger parking lots and malls located along distant highways. This compact and accessible layout encourages walking and reduces the need for excessive space dedicated to parking. Similarly, in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. These communities prioritize public transportation and have less space dedicated to parking, making better use of limited urban space.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have many advantages, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing traffic congestion, promoting healthier lifestyles, and utilizing space more efficiently. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on individuals and communities. By implementing smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable environment for all.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident from various examples around the world, such as the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban implemented in Paris to combat pollution, and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. These initiatives show that reducing reliance on cars can lead to a range of benefits, including improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased physical activity, and more connected communities.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, that number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, communities can significantly decrease these emissions, helping to combat climate change and improve air quality. The driving ban in Paris, for example, resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and helped to clear the smog that had been plaguing the city.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for increased physical activity. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in active modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or using public transportation. This can have numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of obesity, and increased overall fitness levels. The car-free day in Bogota is a prime example of how encouraging alternative modes of transportation can lead to a more active and healthier population.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also help to create more connected and livable communities. When communities are designed with pedestrian and cyclist-friendly infrastructure, such as bike lanes and walkable streets, people are more likely to interact with each other and engage in local activities. This can help create a sense of community and improve overall quality of life. The car-free community of Vauban in Germany, for example, has seen a decrease in car ownership and an increase in walking and cycling, resulting in a more vibrant and connected neighborhood.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can decrease the need for expensive infrastructure, such as highways and parking garages. This can free up valuable land for other purposes, such as parks or affordable housing. Additionally, relying on public transportation can be more cost-effective for individuals, as they do not have to bear the expenses of car ownership, such as fuel, maintenance, and insurance.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have a range of advantages for individuals and society. It can help reduce air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emissions, increase physical activity, create more connected communities, and provide economic benefits. Initiatives such as the car-free community in Vauban, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation and adopting smart planning principles can help to create more sustainable and livable communities.",1

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it a vital part of our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is likely to exceed their share of the popular vote. This helps avoid disputes over the outcome of the election, as was witnessed in the 2000 election. By allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the Electoral College ensures that a candidate with a slight plurality in a state can achieve a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it promotes a candidate with trans-regional appeal. As noted by Judge Posner, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to a diverse range of voters. This results in a president who represents the interests of all regions, rather than just one particular area.

The system of swing states, in which candidates focus their campaign efforts on competitive states, is another advantage of the Electoral College. This was evident in the 2012 election, where candidates directed their attention towards toss-up states. This system of campaigning in swing states ensures that voters in these states have a greater impact on the outcome of the election, encouraging them to pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions. Consequently, the most thoughtful voters become the ones who decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states with the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College provides more attention from presidential candidates to large states, which have a greater share of electoral votes. This ensures that the interests of these populous states are not overshadowed by the smaller states and helps to maintain a balanced political system.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. As seen in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the candidates won the majority in the Electoral College despite having only a plurality of the popular vote. This system eliminates the need for complicated run-off elections and ensures a clear winner with a majority of the electoral votes.

While some critics argue that the Electoral College can discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high turnout in the 2012 election suggests that voters still want to express their political preferences, even if they don't believe their vote will determine the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances the weight of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to voice my support for the retention of the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a crucial constitutional safeguard that ensures fair and representative outcomes in our presidential elections.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, acts as a crucial compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by a vote in Congress. This system consists of 538 electors, who represent each state's Congressional delegation. To be elected President, a candidate must secure a majority of at least 270 electoral votes.

One of the key arguments in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes surpasses their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the popular vote, as witnessed in the 2000 election. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system in most states strengthens the legitimacy of the president, as it creates a decisive electoral victory rather than a fragmented outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal and strategize their campaigns accordingly. No single region, such as the South or the Northeast, possesses enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must focus on gaining support across the nation, avoiding a scenario where certain regions feel unrepresented or ignored by the president. By preventing candidates from solely catering to their regional bases, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes attention to swing states. In recent elections, we have witnessed candidates giving greater importance to states that remain undecided, or ""toss-up states."" By doing so, they actively engage with voters in these states, stimulating their participation and ensuring that the most thoughtful and informed voters have a significant say in determining the outcome of the election. This system encourages candidates to genuinely understand and address the concerns of swing state constituents.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its support for large states. While the Senate provides mal-apportionment of representation, the Electoral College counteracts this imbalance by giving larger states a relatively greater influence. This consideration ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to issues affecting millions of citizens in these states, rather than solely focusing on smaller states. In this way, the Electoral College endeavors to distribute influence and representation more equitably.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by invariably producing a clear winner. With this system in place, there is reduced pressure for repeated rounds of voting when no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote. This streamlines the election process, preventing unnecessary delays and complications.

While critics argue against the Electoral College, claiming it is unfair and outdated, it is important to note that it has stood the test of time for over two centuries. The Electoral College ensures that the presidency represents the interests of a diverse nation and discourages the tyranny of the majority. The continued support of the majority of voters, as evidenced in various polls, demonstrates that the Electoral College enjoys widespread public approval.

In conclusion, the Electoral College safeguards the integrity and representativeness of our presidential elections. Its benefits include the certainty of outcome, the representation of diverse regions, the promotion of swing states, the balanced influence of larger states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. I respectfully ask you, as my esteemed senator, to consider these factors before making any decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College. The preservation of this institution is vital for the stability and prosperity of our nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding on such an important issue. I have faith in your commitment to serving our state and our country to the best of your ability.

Yours sincerely,

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States. While it is understood that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be taken into consideration.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As the system currently stands, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the potential for disputed elections is significantly reduced. In contrast, a direct popular vote system would likely result in more disputes over the outcome, as any slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact. This stability and certainty are crucial in ensuring that our democratic process is respected and can move forward efficiently.

Furthermore, the Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters. This is important because it ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. It fosters national unity and prevents the marginalization of certain areas or interests. Under a popular vote system, candidates would have less incentive to campaign in regions that they know they cannot win, which could lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement among voters in those areas.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states or toss-up states. These states are typically more representative of the entire nation and are likely to have a more thoughtful and engaged electorate. By prioritizing these states, candidates are forced to listen to and address the concerns of a wider range of voters. This ensures that the election is decided by the most informed and engaged citizens, leading to a more representative outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. Large states have more electoral votes and therefore receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This is important in offsetting the disproportionate power held by small states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By giving larger states more weight in the election process, the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard and their interests are taken into account.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complications and logistical challenges that come with run-off elections. It also prevents situations where a candidate with a small plurality of the popular vote could win the election, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the presidency.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of voters in presidential elections are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences. The impact of a single vote in a national election is limited, yet millions of Americans still cast their votes because they believe in the democratic process and want their voice to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides stability, regional representation, thoughtful decision-making, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner. It may have its flaws, but it is a system that has proven effective in ensuring the fair and representative selection of the President. I urge you to consider these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can offer several advantages to both individuals and communities. The concept of reducing car dependency and promoting alternative forms of transportation is gaining momentum around the world. This approach, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to create more sustainable and livable communities. By limiting car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and create more vibrant and accessible neighborhoods.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, that number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help mitigate the effects of climate change and work towards meeting emission reduction targets.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality, particularly in urban areas. The smog levels in cities like Paris and Bogota have reached alarming levels, negatively impacting public health. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.

Apart from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have social and economic advantages. By creating car-free or car-reduced communities, we can encourage social interaction and community engagement. Streets become safer for pedestrians and cyclists, leading to a more active and connected community. Access to public transportation is also improved, making it easier for people to travel to work, school, and social events.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for cost savings. Owning and maintaining a car can be expensive, with costs including fuel, insurance, parking, and maintenance. By relying on alternative forms of transportation, individuals can save money on these expenses and allocate their resources towards other needs. Furthermore, car-free or car-reduced communities often experience increased property values due to their more attractive and sustainable nature.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous benefits to individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and create more vibrant and accessible neighborhoods. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and adopting smart planning strategies, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for everyone.",1

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. The Electoral College, as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has served our nation well and should be upheld for several reasons.

First, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the election results. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their popular vote share. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a significant electoral vote victory. Thus, while a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely.

Second, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Posner argues, no region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful. This system ensures that the president represents and is accountable to the interests of various regions rather than just a specific region.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, ensuring that voters in those states have a significant say in the election. Swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading to more informed and engaged voters. This is crucial in our democracy, as the most thoughtful voters, who pay attention to the competing candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College balances the political power of large and small states. The allocation of electoral votes provides greater weight to large states in proportion to their population, as smaller states typically have a minimum of three electoral votes. This addresses the mal-apportionment of the Senate, ensuring that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, simplifying the presidential election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and pressures associated with run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections express their political preference rather than thinking that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this knowledge, approximately half of the eligible American population still chose to vote in the 2012 election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable compromise that ensures certainty of outcome, promotes unity, empowers swing states, balances the political power of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is essential for preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic system. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our country. I look forward to seeing your continued support for our democratic principles.

Sincerely,

"Electoral college is a dictator, boss, or lottery! It's unfair. It is the duty and privilege of the people to select our government leader. We should choose based on our point of view. The second source conveys effective points to consider, such as, directly voting for the president and the disaster factor. It also informs us that, even though unlikely, there is possibility of a tie.

Directly voting for a president is an issue addressed in both source 2 and 3. They agree that technically, we're not really voting for a president. The second source tells us that when we vote, it is actually sent to the state elector, and it is they electors who vote for the president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer voting directly over our system now. Even though source 3 gives us reasons to keep the electoral college, it will support us when we say we aren't actually voting for the president directly.

Source 2 gives us the ""single best argument"" against the elector college as what it refers to as the disaster factor. It uses the fiasco of 2000, the biggest election crisis in a century, as an example of why we are so lucky. The state legislatures were technically responsible for picking electors and they didn't always have to listen or acknowledge the people's opinionvote. It takes us further back by giving an example of segregationists back in 1960 where John F. Kennedy almost lost the popular vote of Louisiana when their legislature replaced Democratic electors with new ones that opposed him Kennedy. What source 2 calls ""faithless"" electors, electors who dont believe that their candidate will win hence faithless, have occasionly voted in favor of their choice, disregarding the decision of the people.

The third source gives us five reasons in favor of the electoral college method. Even though we don't directly vote, the party chooses the electors and trust that they will select the voted nominee, and it ensures us that the trust is almost never deceived. Disputes over the outcome because of an Electoral College Vote is possible, but not as likely as the popular vote. The next reason given informs us that a region doesnt have enough electoral votes to win the election for the president they favor. ""Swing States"" is another reason. It refers to states that can be persuaded and aren't necessarily entitled to a particular candidate, so they will really pay attention to what the candidates have to say, their campaign. ""Big states"" is the fourth reason and is focused on population advantages. Meaning, a state with smaller population will have just as much impact on the election as one with a larger population, its equal. It is not necessarily a good thing when the last reason says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"". Wouldn't that raise the risk of a tie? Though, it is extremely unlikely that a single vote may decide the president and voters in these elections want to express their opinion and prefernece.

I am in favor of abolishment of the unfair, oldfashioned, and irrational electoral college method. Plus, reasons to keep this system arent as strong and factual as the reasons to abolish it.",0
"Over the past few decades, there has been a growing trend in many parts of the world to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, called ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. Several examples from different countries illustrate the advantages of limiting car usage.

In Vauban, Germany, car ownership is allowed, but street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Instead, there are only two large garages at the edge of the development where car owners can buy a space. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed without cars. By limiting car usage, Vauban has created a more peaceful and environmentally friendly community.

Similarly, in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on this day, leaving the streets empty of traffic jams. The event has been successful, drawing enthusiasm from municipal authorities from other countries who see it as a revolutionary change. The car-free day is part of a larger improvement campaign in Bogota that has led to the construction of bike paths, the creation of parks and sports centers, and the decrease of rush-hour traffic.

Paris, France, also implemented a partial driving ban due to intense smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a fine. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This temporary ban highlights the impact of car usage on air pollution and the need for alternative transportation solutions.

Limiting car usage has multiple advantages. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, and by limiting car usage, communities can make a significant impact on their carbon footprint. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to less congested streets and reduced air pollution. Car-free communities, like Vauban, encourage walking, biking, and public transportation, which are healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation.

There is evidence that the trend of limiting car usage is already happening in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This decrease in driving has occurred even before the recession, indicating a more fundamental shift in American behavior. The decrease in driving has positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, although it may have negative implications for the car industry.

Overall, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, reduced congestion, improved air quality, and the promotion of alternative and sustainable transportation options. The examples from Vauban, Bogota, Paris, and the changing behavior in the United States demonstrate the viability and benefits of this approach. It is clear that limiting car usage is a crucial step in creating more sustainable and livable communities.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States presidential elections. The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, provides several key benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the diverse interests and needs of our nation.

Firstly, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all method of most states ensures that the electoral will invariably exceed the popular vote, minimizing the likelihood of an election dispute. This was particularly evident in the 2012 election, where President Obama secured 61.7% of the electoral vote despite only receiving 51.3% of the popular vote. This prevents prolonged legal battles and promotes a smooth transition of power.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, ensuring that presidential candidates must campaign nationally and listen to the concerns and interests of voters in every state. This prevents regionalism and encourages presidential candidates to represent the entire nation, rather than focusing solely on the needs of one particular region.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making and a better-informed electorate. By focusing on swing states, candidates are forced to address the concerns of diverse populations and avoid relying solely on a specific demographic.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. The apportionment of electoral votes gives larger states more influence, allowing them to have a stronger voice in the election process. This ensures that the needs and interests of larger states are not overshadowed by those of smaller states, creating a more equal representation for all citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College system prevents the need for run-off elections. By providing a clear winner through the electoral votes, the Electoral College eliminates the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. It ensures that a majority winner is determined, even if a candidate has only secured a plurality of the popular vote.

While some argue that the Electoral College undermines the principle of democracy, it is essential to remember that our nation is a representative democracy rather than a pure democracy. The Electoral College ensures that the interests of citizens in every state are represented, regardless of population differences, while also promoting fair and balanced decision-making.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides numerous advantages that promote a fair and representative election process. It ensures that the outcome is certain, candidates have trans-regional appeal, swing states receive attention, large states have their voices heard, and run-off elections are avoided. For these reasons, I urge you to continue supporting and upholding the Electoral College system to ensure a fair and representative process in our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the benefits and implications of the Electoral College system when making decisions that affect the future of our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where efforts to reduce car usage have resulted in positive outcomes. By adopting a car-free lifestyle, communities can experience improved quality of life, reduced carbon emissions, and less congestion.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for residents. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are prohibited in most areas, residents have reported increased happiness and reduced stress levels. The absence of cars allows for peaceful and quiet streets, where the sound of bicycles and children playing replaces the noise of engines (Rosenthal, 3). This creates a more pleasant living environment and fosters a sense of community.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some parts of the United States, this number can reach 50% (Rosenthal, 5). By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air during a period of intense smog. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60% (Duffer, 14). By reducing the number of cars on the road, traffic flow improves, leading to shorter commute times and less frustration for drivers. Additionally, limiting car usage can free up space on the streets, allowing for the development of more pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and the promotion of active transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. It can improve quality of life, reduce carbon emissions, and alleviate traffic congestion. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impacts that can result from adopting a car-free lifestyle. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, communities can reap the benefits of reduced car usage. It is clear that limiting car usage is a step towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"  A Vision for Sustainable Urban Transformation  In an era defined by rapid urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has risen as a visionary approach to address the complex challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, creating space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban landscape.  Car-free cities represent a transformative vision of urban living, with a core focus on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They provide a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though the transition comes with a unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Dear State Senate, I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States president because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine, the text says, ""... according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

paragraph twentythree, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are vast and impactful. As shown in various studies and examples from around the world, reducing car dependency can lead to numerous benefits for individuals, communities, and the environment.

One key advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, and by limiting car usage, we can greatly contribute to the effort of reducing our carbon footprint. For example, in Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in certain car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 2009). By promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free zones, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health and air quality. The harmful effects of air pollution caused by car emissions are well-known. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease air pollution levels and subsequently improve the overall air quality in our communities. This is evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog. As a result, congestion was reduced by 60 percent, and the city experienced a significant improvement in air quality (Duffer, 2014). Similar initiatives have been successful in other cities as well, such as Bogota, where a car-free day led to a reduction in traffic congestion and promoted alternative forms of transportation (Selsky, 2002).

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact urban planning. Traditional suburbs, centered around car ownership and usage, have contributed to the spread of urban sprawl and all its associated problems. However, there is a growing trend in creating car-free or low-car suburban communities, where cars are restricted and alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and public transit, are prioritized. Vauban in Germany is an example of such a community, where streets are car-free, and stores are placed within walking distance (Rosenthal, 2009). This approach not only promotes a more sustainable lifestyle but also creates more vibrant and accessible communities.

In addition to the environmental and urban planning benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on individual well-being. Many people who have given up their cars have reported feeling less stressed and happier. One resident of Vauban in Germany stated, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal, 2009). This is indicative of the fact that relying less on cars can lead to a more relaxed and balanced lifestyle. Walking or cycling instead of driving can also contribute to increased physical activity, resulting in improved health and well-being for individuals.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting sustainable urban planning and individual well-being, the benefits are far-reaching. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free zones, we can work towards a more environmentally friendly and healthier future for our communities. It is crucial for policymakers and individuals to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and actively support initiatives that promote alternative transportation options.",1

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to advocate against changing to the election by popular vote for the President of the United States. While I understand that some argue for the popular vote system, there are several crucial reasons why the Electoral College should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome, ensuring that there is little to no dispute over the election results. As pointed out by Judge Richard A. Posner, in the last presidential election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. In a winner-take-all system, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie or an inconclusive outcome. This stability is crucial for maintaining the public's faith in the democratic process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president."" With its requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no single region can dominate the election. Candidates must prioritize the concerns and interests of diverse regions, resulting in a president who understands and represents the needs of the entire country. This prevents the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of regions that may not be perceived as influential in a national popular vote system.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its emphasis on swing states. By using the winner-take-all method, candidates focus their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain, thereby ensuring that these states receive maximum attention. This, in turn, leads to a more informed and engaged electorate. Voters in swing states become more thoughtful voters, paying close attention to the campaign and the competing candidates. Ultimately, the thoughtful voters should be the ones deciding the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states. According to Judge Posner, the Electoral College compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution, giving more weight to large states. Campaigns allocate more resources, such as time and money, to large states, increasing their importance and influence in the election process. This maintains political equilibrium and ensures that the interests of both large and small states are considered.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This significantly reduces the complexity of the presidential election process, which would otherwise involve run-off elections and potential political uncertainty. By avoiding such situations, the Electoral College provides a straightforward and efficient method for selecting the president.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, the data shows that voter turnout remains strong. Approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, proving that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if their vote may not swing a national election. This highlights the fact that people vote not just to decide an election but to make their voices heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in preserving stability, ensuring representation for all regions, promoting informed voting, balancing the influence of large and small states, and preventing the need for run-off elections. These practical reasons make a strong case for retaining the Electoral College. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the election process for the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make decisions that best serve the interests of the American people.

"Dear Senator, The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for millenniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us. I am in favor in abolishing the Electoral College because most of the power should be held in the hand of the citizens and the popular vote should have more regards than the vote in Congress. I am not in favor in keeping the Electoral College because under the college system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate elector, who in turn ""elect the president"", the process is unfair to voters, and over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election rather than the kind we have now.

When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actually want to be president. Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead. Democrats in Texas for example knowing their vote will have no effect in the election they become less interested in the campaign than they would if the president was choosen directly by popular votes and that is unfair to the people.

The process is unfair to the people because of the ""winner takes all"" system in each state the candidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more genetically to them. The candidates mostly focus on the tight races curing in the ""swing states"" in 2000 many states didnt even get to see the candidates because they were ""little, irrelevant, and worthless"" states. I'm sure many people in those states such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campaign but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger states. This is very unfair and judgemental to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North carolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements.

Many might contradict that the Electoral College is benefical because it has more of a certain outcome but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded. The Electoral College is unfair in many different aspects we need to update our system of election, because like everything else in the world has an expiration date. Their is an expiration date on almost all of our food and beverages, an expiration date on salvery, an expiration date on our life, and so now we need an expiration date on the Electoral College.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world. This concept, referred to as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative transportation options. There are several advantages of limiting car usage that are evident in the passage set.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, resulting in cleaner air and a more sustainable environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved public health. The use of cars is associated with sedentary behaviors, such as sitting for prolonged periods of time, which can lead to various health problems, including obesity and heart disease. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or public transit, we can promote physical activity and improve overall health and well-being. In Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of a car-free day has led millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or use buses, resulting in empty streets and reduced traffic congestion.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the traditional suburban model, cars are necessary for everyday activities, such as grocery shopping or commuting to work. However, by adopting a new approach that places stores within walking distance and emphasizes public transportation, we can create more vibrant and livable communities. Vauban, Germany, serves as an excellent example of this concept, with its walkable streets, bicycle-friendly infrastructure, and easy access to public transit.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The dependence on cars comes with significant costs, including fuel expenses, maintenance fees, and parking fees. By reducing car usage, individuals can save money and allocate those resources to other aspects of their lives. In Paris, France, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog and reduce pollution. While the ban resulted in some loss of revenue for delivery companies, it also highlighted the importance of sustainable transportation alternatives, such as plug-in cars and public transit.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, the creation of more compact communities, and economic benefits. The passage set provides examples from different countries, such as Germany, France, and Colombia, where limiting car usage has led to positive outcomes. As we continue to prioritize sustainability and the well-being of our communities, limiting car usage should be considered as a viable solution. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation options, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematically try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses how a car-free community in Germany has benefited its residents. In this community, car ownership is allowed but parking spaces are limited, leading to fewer cars on the streets. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. The residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without owning a car.

Reducing car usage can also have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The article mentions that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. Suburbs, which are often car-dependent, contribute to these emissions. By adopting car-free or low-car suburban living, like in the Vauban community, it is possible to reduce the emissions caused by cars.

The article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer provides another example of limiting car usage for environmental reasons. Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. This ban resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and lowered smog levels. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals, so this ban was an important step in reducing air pollution in the city. It also highlights the need for a shift in car culture and the promotion of alternative transportation methods.

The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky discusses the success of a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. This program aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. On this day, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event has now spread to other countries, showcasing the potential for reducing car usage on a larger scale.

The article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses a potential shift in American behavior in regards to car usage. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This decrease in driving can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a significant source of emissions. The rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, the availability of car-sharing programs, and the decrease in younger people getting licenses all contribute to this shift in car culture.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have several advantages such as reducing stress, improving happiness, decreasing air pollution, and lowering carbon emissions. The examples provided in the passages showcase different approaches to limiting car usage, including car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days. These initiatives demonstrate the potential for a shift in car culture and the promotion of alternative transportation methods.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. As demonstrated in the passages, there are several reasons why reducing reliance on cars benefits the environment, improves public health, and creates more livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. In Europe, for example, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas of the United States, this number can rise to 50 percent. By decreasing car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage also improves air quality. The passage about smog in Paris highlights how congestion and car emissions can lead to poor air quality. By implementing measures such as driving bans and car-free days, cities can significantly reduce smog levels and create healthier environments for their residents. This is not only beneficial for individuals with respiratory conditions but also for the general population.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and livable communities. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban exemplifies how designing communities that are less dependent on cars can create a more harmonious and enjoyable living environment. By prioritizing public transportation, walking, and cycling, communities become more accessible, reduce traffic congestion, and promote healthier lifestyles. Placing stores within walking distance, rather than in distant malls, also encourages local business and fosters a sense of community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for economic savings. Owning and maintaining a car can be expensive, with costs such as fuel, insurance, registration, and maintenance. By reducing car usage, individuals can save money on these expenses. Additionally, carpooling and shared transportation services, mentioned in the passage about changing cultural habits in the United States, provide cost-effective alternatives to single-car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more livable communities, and lead to economic savings. As evidenced by the passages, various strategies like car-free days, prioritizing public transportation, and promoting alternative modes of transportation have been successful in achieving these benefits. Therefore, it is important for individuals and communities to consider the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing these changes for a more sustainable future.",1
"  The Path to Sustainable Urban Living  In an age of rapid urbanization, the concept of car-free cities is gaining momentum as a visionary solution to the complex challenges posed by urban areas. Car-free cities are urban environments where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or completely prohibited, promoting the use of sustainable transportation alternatives and fostering a healthier, more vibrant urban lifestyle. This essay explores the concept of car-free cities, examining the potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for their successful implementation.  Car-free cities offer a vision of urban living focused on sustainability and well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities contribute to cleaner air and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, thus playing a vital role in mitigating climate change.  Public Health: These cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and enhanced public health. Reduced air pollution levels result in better respiratory and cardiovascular health for urban residents.  Optimal Use of Space: Car-free cities make efficient use of urban space by converting parking lots and wide roads into green areas, parks, and pedestrian zones. This transformation enriches the overall urban landscape and quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: Fewer private cars on the road mean less traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and a less stressful daily life for urban inhabitants.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be costly. By relying less on private vehicles, residents of car-free cities have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, which can contribute to improved financial stability.  Transitioning to car-free cities, however, poses unique challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, leading to potential resistance to the transition to car-free living due to fears of inconvenience and a loss of autonomy.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: A robust public transportation system is essential for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are needed to expand and enhance public transit options, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may face a decline in revenue during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living requires comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  To realize car-free cities successfully, strategies include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods like walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable and vibrant urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a promising glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Deaor Mor. Senatoor, What is the Electooral College? Can voteors contorol whom theior electoors vote foor? Not always. The Electooral College is an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Although many believe it is a necessity foor choosing a poresident, it is not. I believe the porocess of choosing a poresident should be changed to the election by populaor vote in the United States.

Fiorst, what is the Electooral College? In the passage ""What Is the Electooral College"" it says, ""It is a porocess by which the founding fatheors established in the Constitution as a comporomise between election of the Poresident by a vote in Congoress and election of the Poresident by a populaor vote of qualified citizens. The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor youor candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors."" But, little did the fouding fatheors know it is not oreally a comporomise. The Electooral College is composed of 538 electoors.Some of them unfaior ones too. A majoority of 270 electooral votes is orequiored to elect the Poresident. In souorce 2 it says, ""The poresidential election is held eveory fouor yeaors on the Tuesday afteor the fiorst Monday in Novembeor. You help choose youor state's electoors when you vote foor youor Poresident because when you vote foor you or candidate you aore actually voting foor youor candidates electoors."" Second, the Electooral College is not a place, it is a porocess, an unfaior, outdated, and iororational porocess. Accoording to the passage ""The Indefensible Electooral College"" it states how, ""Undeor the Electooral College system, voteors vote not foor the poresident, but foor a slate of electoors who in tuorn elect the poresident."" Do you think that is faior? This porocess is confusing and it should be abolished. Due to the Electooral College many people get confused and sometimes vote foor the worong candidate. In the souorce ""The Indefensible Electooral College"" it says, "" faithless electoors have occasionally orefused to vote foor theior paorty's candidate and cast a deciding vote foor whomeveor they please."" That is unfaior, and iororational. People should be able to have a choice, although they let you feel like you'ore doing something by voting, you actually aore not doing much. The Electooral College gets the last woord.

Thiord, some aorgue that the Electooral College has good intentions, they suppoort theior claims with ideas stated in the passage ""In Defense of the Electooral College"" some such as ""The Electooral College orestoores some of the weight in the political balance to laorge states, the Electooral College orequiores a poresidential candidate to have toransoregional appeal, oor the Electooral College avoids the poroblem of elections in which no candidate orecieves a majoority of the votes cast."" Although these oreasons may be valid, they'ore not enough to puorsuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electooral College should not be abolished.

Cat got youor tongue? In conclusion, as you can see the Electooral College is not always the best way to choose a poresident, it is unfaior, it is outdated since the founding fatheors had set it up, and it is iororational. the Electooral College should be oreplaced with the porocess of populaor vote.",0

Subject: The Case for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the preservation of the Electoral College in selecting the President of the United States. While acknowledging the calls for a change to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system is the most effective way to ensure a fair and representative election process. By taking into account the information from multiple sources, I will outline the advantages of the Electoral College and address some counterarguments against it.

First and foremost, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This makes it highly unlikely for a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote to occur, as opposed to the potential disputes over the popular vote result. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, ensuring a decisive outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President is not only supported by one particular region but has national appeal. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, as residents from other regions may feel disenfranchised and disconnected from their leader. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages broader representation and a president who is viewed as everyone's leader.

The focus on swing states is often criticized, but it is actually a strength of the Electoral College system. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner emphasizes that swing states receive more attention from candidates. This encourages thoughtful voting and attentive consideration of the candidates' platforms and policies. Voters in these states play a crucial role in deciding the election, ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters have a significant say in the outcome.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it balances the weight of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as stated by Judge Posner, can put large states at a disadvantage. However, the Electoral College system restores some of the weight to large states. For example, a small popular vote margin in a large state like Florida can yield a significant number of electoral votes, garnering attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on smaller states and gives larger states the representation they deserve.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. As exemplified by Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College system has consistently produced a clear winner, even in cases where the popular vote victory was by a narrow margin. This avoids the complexity and potential complications of run-off elections and provides a decisive outcome.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, this has not hindered voter turnout significantly. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, approximately half of the eligible population voted in the 2012 election. Voters participate to express their political preferences rather than believing that their single vote may decide the election. The Electoral College does not undermine voter participation but rather affirms the strength and multiplicity of voices in our democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital part of our election process, providing certainty of outcome, encouraging national appeal, promoting thoughtful voting, balancing the weight of states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. It guarantees a fair representation for all Americans and ensures that our President does not solely rely on the support of one region. The Electoral College system stands as a pillar of our democratic values, embodying the principles of compromise and fairness on which our nation was built.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will make an informed decision regarding the future of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Car ownership has long been synonymous with suburban life, but recent trends suggest that limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" is gaining momentum across Europe and the United States. The advantages of limiting car usage include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating more compact neighborhoods, improving accessibility to public transportation, and promoting a healthier and less stressful lifestyle.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with them being the cause of 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can greatly contribute to combating climate change and creating a more sustainable future.

Additionally, limiting car usage allows for the creation of more compact neighborhoods and improved accessibility to public transportation. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example of a car-free community. With streets designed specifically for pedestrians and bicycles, Vauban has fostered a sense of community and reduced the dependence on cars. Similarly, other cities across the globe are adopting this approach, placing stores within walking distance and focusing on public transportation. By doing so, these communities are creating more vibrant and livable spaces.

Not only does limiting car usage benefit the environment and community planning, but it also promotes a healthier and less stressful lifestyle. The reliance on cars often leads to sedentary habits and high levels of stress. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, or public transportation, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This not only improves physical health but also reduces stress levels, as seen in the testimony of Heidrun Walter from Vauban, who states, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In instances where driving is banned, like the temporary driving ban implemented in Paris due to smog, congestion is significantly reduced. This reduction in traffic congestion leads to increased productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, limiting car usage can result in cost savings for individuals, as they no longer need to bear the expenses associated with car ownership, including fuel, maintenance, and parking fees.

In recent years, there has been a shift in American behavior away from car ownership and driving. This change can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major contributor to emissions. It is essential that this trend continues and is supported by policies such as promoting car-reduced communities and investing in public transportation.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and wide-ranging. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating more compact neighborhoods to promoting physical and mental well-being, limiting car usage has the potential to transform our communities and improve our overall quality of life. It is crucial that we embrace this movement and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.",1
"What is a normal day to you? Waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, then getting into car to go to work, right? That last object in that list, getting into your car, puts a strain on the environment, commonly known as pollution. Although the amount of strain that an individual may put on the environment is miniscule, the combined output of all cars in a city may be enough to damage your lungs! In Beijing, China, people wear masks outside to prevent inhalation of the dense smog surrounding the city. This has led to the development of the ""smart planning"" movement, in which city planners build dense suburbs in which cars are unneeded. Shops are a walk away, and your neighbor lives five minutes from your home. You may be asking ""Why do I care about this? I don't have heavy smog in my city."" Well when car use starts to increase in your city, that will affect both your health, and your happiness.

First off, limiting car usage will make you happier. ""How will this make me happy?"" Think about this, you go through your usual morning routine, and you only have five minutes to get to work. That's perfectly fine because, good news, your job is a three minute walk from your house! This drastically reduces stress as said in this quote from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars."" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Secondly, the smog from cities with high car usage is becoming unbearable. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" In Paris, after a few days of ""nearrecord pollution,"" enforced a partial, temporary driving ban. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following da y."" The congestion levels of Paris were down by an astonishing sixty percent after five days of the smog. Imagine that, in five days smog levels reduced by sixty percent. Imagine what the whole world could do if everyone pitched in to this trend. ""Automobiles, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Lastly, a reduction of car use can vastly improve the economy. In Bogota, Colombia, the local government have begun to enforce a ""Day Without Cars"" in an effort to curb rising pollution levels. This has been happening for three years, and has increased profits for small shops and eateries in the area. Because of the large number of walkers and bikers, shops were able to make a larger profit with walkins that just happened to pass by the store. This is what caused more stores to open up, thus boosting the local economy. Even businessmen are enjoying these days as stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" To end this off, cars use can be greatly reduced. It is a matter of willpower, which everyone has, but some are too lazy to tap into it. The reduction of car use will have long term effects on both you and the globe. By minimizing the time you spend in a car, you are increasing your happiness, decreasing pollution, and helping boost the economy! If you think cars are a necessity in today's shrinking world, think again. New York is a perfect example in which rush hour traffic makes it impossible to get to work on time by car. Even in new small suburbs, cars are becoming a thing of the past. Tomorrow, instead of driving to work or to the store, try walking. You just might enjoy it.",0
"A president election is great but, there are some difficulties along the way of deciding who will be able to vote. People are asking themselves whether or not they should keep the electoral vote or get rid of it and have a popular voting method. To me, the popular voting method is reasonable. I believe that you should get rid of the electoral collage method and change it to the popular voting method because its fair to the voters, YOU are able to vote for the president of your choice, and because of the winnertakeall system. You need to think about everyone in the all the states not just electing your president. Your people need to agree with the choice that has been made.

The electoral collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters. everyone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decide ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is not fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn around and vote for the other person. In Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" backs up my response when stating,""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.

With the popular voting method you are able to choose the president of your choice, not the president's electors. In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligible to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyone agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?

Another thing that is unfair in the election is the winnertakeall system in each state. People don't usually spend time in states they know the don't have a chance at winning. Who would? these states only focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Sometime around the 2000 campaign, apporximately 17 states didn't at all see those candidates. Even when there were voters in states that had 25 of the largest media markets, they were not able to see not even one ad from the campaign. This is being said in Source 2 ""The indefensible electoral college : why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have implemented various strategies to limit car usage and have experienced positive outcomes. These initiatives range from car-free neighborhoods to car-free days, all aimed at promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating more sustainable communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transportation, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the alleviation of traffic congestion. In cities like Paris, where driving bans were enforced during periods of intense smog, there was a significant decrease in congestion. In fact, congestion in the capital of France was reduced by 60 percent during the driving ban. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time and frustration associated with commuting. With fewer cars on the road, people can travel more efficiently and safely.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The use of diesel fuel, which is common in many countries, including France, has been linked to increased air pollution. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing diesel usage, we can improve air quality and protect public health. In Bogota, Colombia, car-free days have been implemented to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The success of this initiative has led to other Colombian cities joining in, indicating the potential for these events to inspire change in other countries as well.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. In Germany, the suburb of Vauban serves as a model for low-car suburban life. With car-free streets, residents have to rely on walking, cycling, or using public transportation to get around. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent even sold their cars to move to this car-free community. This approach to urban planning allows for more compact communities, with amenities and services within walking distance, reducing the need for long car trips.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and creating sustainable communities, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. Countries like Germany, France, and Colombia have already implemented strategies to limit car usage, and these initiatives serve as examples for other countries to follow. It is essential that we continue to explore and support measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce our reliance on cars.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable and efficient communities. As exemplified in Vauban, Germany, where a car-free community has been established, limiting car usage can lead to happier and more relaxed residents. Additionally, car-free suburbs have been gaining traction around the world, as planners realize the need to create compact, accessible communities with less space dedicated to parking. By adopting this approach, we can promote alternative transportation options, increase public transportation usage, and create a healthier and more sustainable future.

One of the main reasons for limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can go up to 50 percent. By decreasing our reliance on cars and promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of pollution caused by car emissions. After the ban was implemented, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels dropped. Similarly, in the Colombian capital of Bogota, a car-free day was introduced to reduce smog and promote alternative modes of transportation such as biking and taking the bus. The success of these initiatives highlights the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and efficient communities. In the car-free community of Vauban, residents have embraced a low-car suburban life, with 70 percent of families not owning cars. Stores and amenities are placed within walking distance, promoting a more active and healthy lifestyle. This approach to urban planning is being adopted around the world, as cities recognize the need to move away from car-centric development and create more compact and accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable and efficient communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the success of limiting car usage initiatives and the positive impact they can have. It is essential for individuals and policymakers to prioritize alternative transportation methods and embrace a more car-free lifestyle in order to create a healthier and more sustainable future.",1
"For many years, the automobile has become and remained a staple in the world as humanity's most popular choice of transportation. The number of cars manufactured by car companies has reached the hundreds of millions. Cars have been a trademark of American ingenuity and the evolution of technology. However, as we go into the great beyond that is the future, we must take into consideration the pains and risks of these vehicles, and if they are worth driving as the world population exceeds seven billion.

Few people can recall a time where global warming wasn't the main conflict of scientists today. The Earth gets warmer as pollution levels rise as smog around cities like Paris and Mexico City reaches an all time high. The polar caps are melting at a rapid rate as hurricanes ravage the mainland harder and harder each year. What caused this stuff to happen? Why, look no further than our friends, the factories and automobiles! These two have been quoted time and time again as the catalyst of the global warming crisis. With such an adverse effect on the ozone layer, governments around the world have to do something to stop it from rising any further, with nothing short of success. Places like France have realized the extreme rise in smog levels in the city of Paris, that they had to do something. So, they made a ban on driving for people with even numbered license plates with only a few exceptions, and banned odd numbered licensed cars the next to try to curtail this occurrence. After a few days, it worked. The smog cleared just enough for the French government to rescind its ban on license plates for the city. Such a huge difference in smog in only two days means that making a ban similar to this could be nothing short of beneficial for communities around the globe. So why don't more communities take up the hard task of making this ban a regular happening? It's a slow process, but it is happening, in unlikely places. Including over in our Western European ally Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a small community town located near the border of France and Switzerland. This town is best known for it's extremely unorthodox method of removing greenhouse gases from the ozone layer. People have decided to give up their cars, just relying on other transportation like walking and taking a local tram. Street parking, driveways and home garages are just not allowed in the district, and this has caused a huge difference between noncar owners and car owners alike. Seventy percent of the population in Vauban does not own a motor vehicle, a large portion of them sold their cars to move out to this small, cozy little town. Busy sidewalks and the chatter of civilians outshines the faint murmurs of the few odd automobiles in the city. What started out as an odd social experiment has turned into a great community full of happy people. Although this type of community is generally unpopular, other countries around the world have come to like the idea Vauban came up with. The capital city of Colobia, Bogota, has a neat program they like to call the Day Without Cars. The title speaks for itself. Civilians would take one day out of the year to generally not use cars, to promote the likening of taking other modes of transportation to wherever you need to go. Countries in South America have noticed this day, and are looking to replicate it themselves, which ultimately signifies the success of the Day Without Cars.

Countries around the world have all tried to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, whether by making a community built around the nonuse of cars, making a day celebrating the use of other modes of transportation, or just banning the driving of automobiles outright. As just of a cause it may be, Americans are still hesitant to enact such henious laws. However, if more communities are built around this clean idea, more and more people will flock to it. It just takes preserverence, a strong plan, and a whole lot of sidewalks.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This is supported by evidence from various sources, including the excerpts from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, especially in suburban areas where car ownership is high, we can significantly contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. Vauban, a German suburb mentioned in Rosenthal's article, is a perfect example of how living without cars can lead to a reduction in emissions. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The excerpt from Duffer's article about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impacts of car emissions on air pollution. When a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris, congestion decreased by 60 percent, and the smog cleared enough to rescind the ban for certain days. Similar effects were seen in Bogota, Colombia, during their car-free day, as mentioned in a passage by Selsky. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly improve air quality in congested cities, benefitting the health and well-being of citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient transportation systems. By focusing on smart planning and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can create more compact and accessible communities. This is evident in the example of Vauban, where stores are placed within walkable distances and public transportation serves as the main mode of transportation. By reducing car usage, we can minimize traffic congestion, shorten commute times, and make cities more livable for all residents.

There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. The reduction in car ownership can lead to savings for individuals who no longer need to purchase and maintain cars. As mentioned in Rosenthal's article, some suburbs in the United States are promoting ""car-reduced"" communities, and experts expect public transport to play a larger role in federal transportation bills. By investing in public transportation and creating car-free or low-car communities, we can redirect funds from building and maintaining highways to more sustainable forms of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages that can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more efficient transportation systems and providing economic benefits, there are numerous reasons to consider reducing our reliance on cars. By making changes at both individual and societal levels, we can create a cleaner, healthier, and more accessible environment for all.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This idea is being embraced in various parts of the world, as seen in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota. By separating suburban life from auto use, communities can become more sustainable and environmentally friendly. One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, and by reducing car usage, we can have a positive impact on the environment. In Europe, cars contribute to 12 percent of these emissions, and the figure can be as high as 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By adopting practices like those in Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is limited, we can encourage people to give up their cars and rely on other forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also have other positive effects. It can help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote a healthier lifestyle. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air during days of intense pollution. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent. This shows that by limiting car usage, we can create a cleaner and healthier environment for everyone. In Bogota, the implementation of a car-free day has become a popular event, with millions of people choosing to use alternative forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also encourages people to engage in physical activity, like hiking, biking, or skating, which leads to a healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can save money on infrastructure costs, like building and maintaining roads and parking spaces. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can support businesses located closer to residential areas, as seen in the example of Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance of homes. This can lead to the development of more compact and accessible communities, with less space allocated for parking and more space for amenities and public transportation.

Overall, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease traffic congestion, improve air quality, promote a healthier lifestyle, and have economic benefits. By adopting practices seen in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is important for individuals and policymakers to prioritize the use of alternative modes of transportation and emphasize the importance of limiting car usage for a more sustainable future.",1
"In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of ""everything else,"" Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.

To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.

Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.

In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.",0
"I think that limiting car usage is great for the environment. There are a lot of benefits that come from it. If we use car less then greenhouse gas emissions will decrease and thus cleaning the air of smog. Some of the benefits that limiting car use is that: 1. it decreases poisonous smog, 2. lots of cities in the world are doing it, 3. and last but not least it could promote other ways of travel. Its about time that the world start changing some harmful habits.

To start of, Reducing car use is very effective when trying to get rid of smog. In some cities such as Paris, smog is a big pollution there. In Paris they even went head to head with Beijing,China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of this globally known city. by enforcing this, some days cars with even numbered license plate could drive. The next day odd numbered cars could drive. If you were caught then you were fined. so by paris doing this congestion was down a whopping 60% in Paris after just 5 days.

This would cut down greenhouse effects tremendously. So far reducing car use sounds pretty good.

Furthermore Paris isnt the only place in the world to do this. Bogota,Colombia in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians either hiked, bike, skated, or took a bus to commute around the country to their destination. This is known as a car free day. This carfree day left the streets of the capitol void and empty of rush hour traffic. Even the U.S. government is considering the international event that is also helping the environment at the same time.

Another thing to reduce greenhouse gas is if people would find a more alternative way of transportation. City buses could count as an alternative,because think if a bus could seat 30 people. Think if all 30 people had their own car, then the emission amout would substantialy increase 30 vehicles rather than 1 vehicle. Other ways of transportation are things such as bikes, skatesskateboard, or just walking. none of those alternatives release any type of emissions.

In a way not using cars sounds great in many ways,but there are those people out there that rely on the usage of cars to transport themselves such as anyone with physical handicaps. Maybe this is the start of something new but what happens to this earth is all on us so it what we dicide to do with it rather we wont it to last or we can just let it go and lose the one planet we have left.",0
"Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the dependency on cars, communities can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote more sustainable and healthier lifestyles.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to studies mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, communities can make a substantial impact in reducing these emissions. For example, the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and streets are car-free, has significantly lower emissions compared to car-intensive areas. This demonstrates that smart planning and reducing car usage can lead to a decrease in environmental pollution.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage has various health benefits. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which contributes to respiratory problems and other health issues. By promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, biking, or taking public transit, communities can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with pollution. The car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, for instance, resulted in a significant decrease in traffic congestion and promoted alternative modes of transportation, leading to cleaner air and a healthier city.

Moreover, limiting car usage can help create more accessible and walkable communities. Many suburbs are designed for car dependency, with stores located in malls along distant highways. However, adopting a new approach like Vauban, where stores are placed on a main street within walking distance, allows for more compact and accessible communities. This reduces the need for long car trips and encourages individuals to use alternative forms of transportation. Not only does this create a more connected and vibrant community, but it also reduces traffic congestion and the need for excessive parking spaces.

While some may argue that limiting car usage could inconvenience individuals or businesses, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Delivery companies may experience temporary setbacks, but the long-term benefits of cleaner air and reduced emissions are invaluable. Additionally, public transport options can be expanded to serve suburbs, making it more convenient for individuals to travel without cars. Awareness campaigns, like the car-free day in Bogota, can also help change attitudes and encourage individuals to embrace alternative modes of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage provides numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing dependency on cars, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote more sustainable and healthier lifestyles. Creating car-free or car-reduced communities, like Vauban in Germany, can serve as examples for the rest of the world to adopt smart planning strategies. While there may be some initial inconveniences, the long-term benefits of limiting car usage far outweigh any potential drawbacks. It is time to shift our focus from car-centered communities and embrace a more sustainable and healthier future.",1
"Citizens are often using cars to get from work and back, however if citizens were to stop using cars there could be some advantages like traffic can be reduced, new buildings can be built, and habits of car use can be stopped.

If citizens were to cut down on using cars traffic would be reduced. According to Robert Duffer a person from the Chicago Tribune he states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Robert Duffer, paragraph 14. With that being stated by Robert Duffer it should be clear to people that with reduced traffic people are able to get to places where they need to be in just a short matter of time, citizens won't have to worry about being late for whatever it is citizens have to do. Robert Duffer also states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters 12 Citizens should realize that with almost 4,000 people being fined it should tell citizens that they should cut down on car usage to help prevent smog and to also save them money.

Along with citizens cutting down on car usage to reduce traffic if they were to cut car usage new building can be built. According to Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times he states that ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitty sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Andrew Selsky, paragraph 28. When citizens cut down on car usage many new things can be built and explored by citizens but if citizens were to not stop car usage then new things wouldn't be built and old things couldn't be replaced or fixed. Andrew Selsky also states that it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths 27. There is many citizens out in the world that would rather ride bikes than to use a car just to prevent pollution, with 118 miles of bicycle paths there shouldn't really be any car use. Using bicycles could help change the world so much more and less pollution could be created.

Not only with citizens cutting down on car use for new buildings to be built, citizens can stop their habits of car usage if they give it a try. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal a lady from the New York Times she states that ""with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession may find less reason to resume the habit"" Elisabeth Rosenthal, paragraph 36.Citizens stopping car commuting could really help those citizens with habits of not being able to stop car commuting which could result in saving the earth and air pollution. Elisabeth also states that a chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety 43. While the chairman of the Ford Motor Company is stating this information maybe citizens will change their minds about car usage just to improve safety or to even safe time.

All in all this why citizens should car usage to reduce traffic, new buildings can be built, and to try and stop habits of car use by giving it a try. Citizens trying to do these could help stop air pollution and they could also save themselves money.",0
"Men are like ants. We are always in a rush and always desperate to arrive on time. The easiest way to arrive on time in any place, is by car. Cars, however, tend to do a lot more bad then they do good. Cars release large amounts of pollution and can raise smog and noise levels in areas where there is a lot of driving. Smog and pollution isn't very good for anybody, so some areas have taken preventative steps to keep Earth healthy and to keep people healthy as well. The shocking part is, the cars get cut out.

In some areas, like the experimental Vauban in Germany, cars are not allowed at all. No honking is heard when the sun rises, and streets are oddly empty. Shops are lined up within walking distance, and few buses run to allow for people to travel a little bit quicker. In fact, 70% of vaughn's population do not own cars, and many sold their cars for a chance to live in Vauban. The streets are safer, and people seem to be a lot less tense about things, when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun, an occupant of Vauban. Vauban has proved that removing the car entirely can help to calm people, and even redesign the way cities and homes work to provide safer, cleaner areas for man to live in.

Cars can need to be removed for more negative reason as well. Paris, France, had sever issues with the amount of smog in the city. Smog can be incredibly dangerous, making large chances of acid rain and possible issues with breathing. France has had one of the largest amounts of smog when compared to many other cities, usually only beat by Beijing, which in one of the most polluted areas. France knew, however, that the city could not possibly handle having every car taken away in a night, so they attempted to cut a half off for each day. For a week, fines were placed on cars with license plates that ended in either an even or odd number, the taxes applied more specifically to which license plates would be tagged, odd on one day, even the next. The large fines did not persuade everyone, however, and 4,000 driviers were still fined. The week of cutting down cars, however, proved to work very well and cut down on the amount of smog quickly and carefully so that everyone would have a safer and cleaner Paris.

In Bogota, Columbia, the removal of cars is celebrated as if it were a holiday. Each year on one day everyone will refrain from driving to skateboard, bike, walk, hike, or any number of modes of transportation to prevent the usage of cars. The city does this not only as a fun way to promote an ecofriendly Bogota, but to cut down on it's own smog issues. Like any capital of any country, there's a lot of movement, and with movement comes cars, and with cars: smog. Their event has even inpired many other cities and countries to do the same thing, continuously aiding in the fight against global warning.

Even America, the gasguzzling, NASCAR approving, roadrage warriors of the world, try to cut down on car usage. The issue has even reached the President. America has found that slowly but surely that men and women are slowly moving away from the car as a mode of transportation. Since 2005, car usage has dropped tremoendously in favour of public transportation like trams and buses.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and wide-ranging. Limiting car usage can have positive effects on the environment, public health, and the overall quality of life for citizens.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality, with levels of particulate matter in the air exceeding those in other European capitals. By limiting car usage, especially in densely populated areas, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage mentions the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden and streets are designed to be car-free. This type of smart planning can create communities where amenities such as stores and public transportation are within walking distance, reducing the need for lengthy car trips. This not only makes it more convenient for residents to access necessities but also promotes physical activity and social interaction.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The passage mentions how delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for electric and hybrid vehicles. This indicates that promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as electric cars or bicycles, can support new industries and create job opportunities.

Finally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on overall quality of life. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota highlights how banning cars for a day can create a sense of community and reduce stress. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more pedestrian-friendly streets, reduce traffic congestion, and create safer and more enjoyable public spaces.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more compact and accessible communities and improving overall quality of life. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning principles, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"  A Sustainable Vision for Urban Living  In an age characterized by rapid urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as an innovative approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, creating space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident from the various examples provided in the passage set. The suburban community of Vauban in Germany serves as a successful case study for limiting car usage (Rosenthal 1-9). The streets of Vauban are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. Only two places are available for parking, which encourages residents to use alternative modes of transportation like walking or biking. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal 3). This shows that by limiting car usage, residents are adopting healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.

Another example of limiting car usage can be seen in the car-free day initiative in Bogota, Colombia (Selsky 21-28). On this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free from traffic congestion. This promotes alternative transportation methods and reduces smog. The success of this initiative is evident from the positive response it has received, with other cities in Colombia joining the event (Selsky 25). This demonstrates that limiting car usage has the potential to create a cultural shift towards more sustainable transportation choices.

Furthermore, limiting car usage has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal 5). By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and combat climate change. This is supported by the findings that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses, suggesting a shift in behavior towards reducing car dependency (Rosenthal 29-43).

In addition to the environmental benefits of limiting car usage, there are also social and economic advantages. For instance, by making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, people can have easier access to basic amenities like stores and services (Rosenthal 6). This reduces the need for long distance travel and reliance on cars. Moreover, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on public health by encouraging physical activity, as seen in Vauban, where people prefer walking or biking instead of driving (Rosenthal 3).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and include environmental, social, and economic benefits. By adopting policies and initiatives that promote alternative transportation methods and reduce car dependency, societies can create more sustainable and livable communities. The examples provided in the passage set, such as Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, highlight the potential for successful implementation of such measures. The shift towards reducing car dependency can play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change, improving public health, and creating more accessible and vibrant communities. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing such measures on a larger scale.",1
"Dear Mrs. Senaitor, The Elecitoral College is unfair, ouitdaited, and a poorly represenitaitive sysitem for our naition. Previous elecitions and facits show ithait ithe Elecitoral College may have worked in ithe pasit, buit does noit work in accuraitely represeniting ithe millions of voiters in our counitry any longer.

In ithe 2000 presidenitial campaignn, ithe unfairness of ithe Elecitoral College was blaitanitly obvious.

During ithis campaignn in 2000, Al Gore received more individual voites ithan George W.

Iit is obvious ithait ithe voites of ithe Elecitoral College do noit accuraitely reflecit ithe opinions of ithe people, and gives ithe ciitizens of our counitry poor represenitaition in our governmenit.

The argumenits in favor of ithe Elecitoral College are weak ait besit. In ithe ariticle ""In Defense of ithe Elecitoral College: Five reasons ito keep our despised meithod of choosing ithe Presidenit"" by Richard A. Posner, ithe opening paragraph is pracitically an argumenit againsit ithe Elecitoral College. In ithe ariticle, Posner sitaites, ""The Elecitoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocraitic meithod of seleciting a presidenit... ithe advocaites of ithe posiition are correcit in arguing ithait ithe Elecitoral College meithod is noit democraitic... iit is ithe elecitors ithait choose ithe presidenit, noit ithe people.""

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages that can improve the quality of life for individuals and communities. The articles provided present evidence and examples from different parts of the world, highlighting the benefits of reducing car dependency.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to global warming and air pollution. According to the passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact in reducing these harmful emissions and protecting the environment.

Secondly, limiting car usage can lead to less traffic congestion and improved transportation efficiency. The passage by Andrew Selsky describes how during a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, streets were devoid of traffic jams, and congestion was reduced by 60 percent in Paris during a partial driving ban. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation, we can alleviate the strain on the roads and create a more efficient transportation system for everyone.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote healthier and more active lifestyles. The passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses how cities like Vauban, Germany, have become car-free, leading to a rise in bicycling and walking. The absence of cars on the streets creates a safer and more inviting environment for pedestrians and cyclists, encouraging them to adopt healthier modes of transportation. This can have a positive impact on public health by reducing sedentary behavior and promoting physical activity.

In addition to the personal benefits, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. The passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal mentions the growing trend of car-reduced communities in the United States, where the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting such initiatives. By reducing the need for car ownership and promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money on car expenses such as maintenance, fuel, and parking. This can lead to increased disposable income and improved financial stability for households.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about a range of advantages for individuals and communities. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, to alleviating congestion and promoting healthier lifestyles, the evidence presented in the passages demonstrates the positive impact of reducing car dependency. By adopting smart planning and embracing alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable communities for future generations.",1

Subject: Keep the Electoral College: Preserving a Compromise for Fair Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While many argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy, ensuring fair representation, regional balance, stability, and avoiding the need for run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This safeguard ensures that a clear winner emerges, reducing the likelihood of disputes and controversies surrounding election results. In contrast, a direct popular vote could result in many tight races being subject to recount requests and legal challenges, creating uncertainty and undermining public trust in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national unity by requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates must campaign nationally, ensuring that the interests of all areas are considered. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas or specific regions, ensuring that every state and its respective voters receive attention during presidential campaigns.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states are characterized by a close margin, resulting in candidates dedicating more attention and resources to win over these voters. By prioritizing swing states, candidates are compelled to engage with diverse perspectives and prioritize issues that resonate with a broad cross-section of the electorate. This ensures that the most thoughtful and diverse voters, actively engaged in the campaign, ultimately decide the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides an important balance to the political influence of large states. The system restores some weight to these states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate prescribed in the Constitution. By giving larger states more attention, presidential candidates recognize the significance of their concerns, interests, and diverse population. This approach fosters inclusivity and prevents candidates from focusing solely on the needs of smaller, less populated states.

Lastly, the Electoral College mitigates the need for run-off elections. This process avoids the complications that arise when no candidate receives an overall majority of the popular votes cast, as seen in previous elections. A run-off election would significantly prolong the election process, increase costs, and cause further voter fatigue and disengagement. By maintaining the Electoral College, we uphold the principle of a clear and decisive majority that simplifies the election process.

Opponents of the Electoral College argue that it disenfranchises voters in states where their preferred candidates have no chance of winning. However, voter turnout data from previous elections clearly indicates that voters are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences, rather than the notion that their individual vote could swing the national result. Furthermore, dismantling the Electoral College would shift campaign strategies to focus solely on densely populated areas, effectively silencing the voices of less populous states and rural Americans.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system. It ensures a fair, balanced, and stable process for electing the President, guaranteeing certainty of outcome, encouraging national unity, giving attention to swing states and large states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. I implore you to continue supporting the preservation of the Electoral College, preserving the spirit of compromise that our founding fathers established in the Constitution.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College for Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there have been calls for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that make it essential to our democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner of the electoral vote invariably wins with a clear majority and, as a result, disputes over the outcome are less likely to occur compared to a popular vote system. This stability is important for maintaining the integrity and legitimacy of our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. It prevents candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated regions and requires them to campaign across the country. This fosters a sense of representation for all Americans, regardless of the size or population of their state, and ensures that the president has broader support.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method in the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states. This means that voters in these states become more engaged and informed about the candidates' policies and positions. The election outcome is thus determined by the most thoughtful and well-informed voters, ensuring that the decision reflects the interests and concerns of a diverse range of citizens.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which gives smaller states more representation, is counterbalanced by the weight given to large states in the Electoral College. This ensures that candidates cannot focus solely on densely populated areas and must take into account the concerns of both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner who receives a majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from run-off elections and provides a more efficient and straightforward process for determining the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a valuable and effective method for electing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, ensures the representation of swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers numerous benefits that cannot be easily dismissed.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will consider these points when evaluating any proposals for changing our current election process. It is crucial that we preserve and strengthen the integrity of our democratic system for the benefit of all Americans.

Sincerely,

"The system by which America elects its president is neither democratic nor fair. It favors small states, could possibly elect the loser of the popular vote, and discourages minority voters.

In many states, the electors who vote for president are not required to vote for who won in the state they represent, says Plumer. An elector could decide, ""I dont like who won, so I'll vote for this other candidate"". One could say, since a party will choose its electors, that it will hardly ever happen, says Posner. It's true, but it shouldn't ever be able to happen, and it has happened. Plumer points out, that several times in America's past, electors have defied the will of the people. It is impossible to be completely sure of someone's loyalty.

Another problem is that it is possible to win enough electoral votes to become president, but not enough of the actual population's vote to have won the popular vote, argues Plumer. Because senatorial seats count towards a state's electoral votes, and the fact that each state gets 2 Senators, no matter their population, more populated states' votes are technically stolen by less populated ones through the Senate. The Electoral College essentially has a skewed view of population distribution. Winning a majority of the popular vote in smaller states will give you slightly more electoral votes for population than larger ones. In most cases though, a candidate will win both the electoral and popular vote, says Posner. While that is the case msot of the time, people would not accept the possibility that in, say, a sports game, the loser might randomly win because of the system used to determine it. It is arguably more important that a country is run by the correct person.

Posner claims that the Electoral College prevents a third party jumping in and grabbing enough votes prevent either ""big party"" candidate from winning. While in a truly direct vote, this could happen, the Electoral College allows for the same exact problem. If a third party candidate manages to win the election in just a few states, he could steal enough electoral votes that no candidate manages to get the 270 votes needed for a victory. Plumer warns that ""most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"". A tie, with both candidates getting 269 votes, would be solved in the same way as a third party getting enough votes that no one manages to get over 269. The House of Representatives would vote on the president. Here, the bigger states are again cheated of their power, as the delegates for as states, and not individuals. Wyoming's sole representative has as much sway as the 55 from California. On top of this unfairness, the delegates do not have to vote as the states have. If a majority Republican state were to have a majority Democratic representation, the state could very possibly end up voting in the candidate of the opposite party. As the Electoral College was created at the creation of the nation itself, and the president and vicepresident didn't campaign together, the Senate chooses the vicepresident, independently. If the Senate and House are are opposite parties, the president and vicepresident could end up being from opposite parties. Plumer gives the examples of 1968 and 1976, where ""a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election,"" and ""a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way,"" respectively.

Posner addresses the argument that the Electoral College discourages voters of the opposite party of a state dominated by the other party from voting. He says ""no voter's vote swings a national election... Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politcal preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" That view is what causes people to not vote. Even 1% of America's population would be three million people, and among those three million, there are without a doubt, people who believed that lie that their vote doesn't matter. Plumer's examples of the elections of 1968 and 1976, referenced earlier, are prime examples of times where just about 1% of that 1% of the population's votes were needed to change the possible outcome of the election.

The Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system. The fact that it even has the possibility to essentially make the loser win should be enough of a reason to abolish it in favor of something like a true majority wins election. On top of possible ""failure"", the Electoral College pretends that more people live where they dont, and less people live where they do, and discourages minority voters from even voting, especially if they're in a larger state, an extreme minority, or a combination of the two.",0
"The state senator that is reading this should understand that in my favor keeping the Electoral College is the wise thing to do. It will avoid runoff elections and how it always has a process if something happens and that the process is fairhence Electoral College would be the best.

To start off, the Electoral College helps with elections be cause it avoids runoff elections. In other words it keeps us from running into problem where neither candidate gets the majority of the the votes cast. For example, in 1968 president Nixon and Clinton in 1992 each had 43 percent of the popular votes but because their electoral votes was 301 to 370 it does matter so this means it was a runoff election until the percentage of votes changed. The Electoral College soon produces a clear winner. This is just solving a problem where no candidate receives the majority of votes. Now there is only one con to the Electoral College and that is that it may turn off people from voting because they believe that their vote out of everybody who votes isnt enough to do a difference so they dont even vote. So voters in presidential elections are way better than just one vote deciding an election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College is consisted of 538 electors. The candidate needs atleast 270 to be elected. If they have atleast 270 and there and they are not tied, but they have the same popular votes, also known as a plurality. The Electoral Colleges 538 electors will decide. This is 100 percent fair because those electors study this, they do this for their job, and they understand. They make up for the people who didn't vote. So just think, wouldnt you want 538 professional electors deciding whos president or 538 people who dont even want to vote and dont even know about the campaign to decide whos your president. All the lying about the Electoral College that it is an anachronism is false it is a success. This is common sense if you ask me.",0
"  Transforming Urban Living for a Sustainable Future  In an age of rapid urbanization and increasing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a transformative solution to address the complex challenges of modern urban life. Car-free cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, giving rise to sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban landscape.  Car-free cities represent a visionary vision of urban living, one that prioritizes sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition comes with a unique set of challenges.  One of the primary benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By promoting pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities optimize urban space, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a substantial financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College and urge you to maintain its existence as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is essential in preserving the fairness, certainty of outcome, and representation that our democracy depends on.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As mentioned in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputes over the outcome of the election, as seen in the 2000 election crisis. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a slight plurality in a state can still secure a landslide victory in the electoral vote. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding the need for run-off elections or prolonged disputes.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the idea of an inclusive president for all Americans. Judge Richard A. Posner points out that the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to diverse regions and address the concerns of a variety of communities. This prevents the marginalization of certain regions and ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than just those in densely populated areas.

The swing state factor is another crucial advantage of the Electoral College. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on toss-up states. This ultimately leads to greater campaign efforts and attention being paid to the concerns of voters in these states. In turn, these voters become more thoughtful and engaged in the electoral process, resulting in a more informed and representative election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College serves to balance the political power between large and small states. Judge Posner explains that while the Senate's mal-apportionment may disadvantage large states, the Electoral College restores some weight to their political influence. Presidential candidates recognize the importance of large states as they provide more electoral votes. This ensures that smaller states do not dominate the election process and guarantees that a candidate must consider the diverse concerns of both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from run-off elections. With the current system, a clear winner can be determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can be time-consuming and divisive.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a vital component of our democratic system. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Abolishing the Electoral College would undermine these principles and potentially lead to a less fair and representative election process. I urge you to consider the numerous advantages provided by the Electoral College and to support its continuance.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of upholding the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"I believe that disbanding electoral college would be in favor of most peoples decisions. This way everyone has a chance to vote decisively and not having electoral college decide who should be the president of the united states. Electoral college docent let the people decide who they want to be president. It lets the lets the slate of electors decide which is totally un fair in my decision. People are the ones who elect which president they feel will make the United States a better country. Maby the slate of electors have a different decision in mind than what the people of america think about who should be president.

Popular vote would be much better in my decision because it gives everyone a chance on picking there president and not having other people pick it for them. Say there was a tie in the electoral votes, than they would be passed onto the house or reps were state delegations vote on the president and not the people of america. There is a greater quantity of people than there are slate of electors and house of representatives. The electoral college is completely unfair to voters because in each state candidates dont spend time in states they dont think will help them win presidency. We the people dont have the ability to choose who we want as a president and we want our freedom of being able to do that. There will be less conflicts and anger from the people if they disband electoral college.

But in many eyes electoral college are in favor to those people. They think its right to have the slate of electors vote for who they think would be a better president. The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. But it could lead to more pressure in the election process, which could greatly complicate the presidential elections. There for saying that electoral college isint a good decision to have. People should decide what they want to have for this country. They should be able to take a mark and say we dont want electoral college anymore for the United States.

It would have to be weighted in an election of the people to decide what they want to have. Electoral college method of selecting a president may have a big impact on people by not choosing the president they want. Saying in the peoples minds that Electoral College should be disbanded and gotten rid of because it depends on what the people of the U.S. choose, not the slate of electors.",0
"Dear Senator, I believe that the United States deserves someone who will lead this country to do the right thing, to make independent choices, and to be the best version of ourselves we can be every day. Now, how do we know when choosing a leader to represent us if thats what we will achieve when voting? We don't for sure, but we can make judgements and calls that will give us a better understanding to whom we are choosing. One of the biggest fought over rights was the right to vote, in which everyone wanted. Now that we have that vote, we should be able to use that freedom and have a say in who we want to represent us. Therefore, I think we should change the election to popular vote for the President of the United States rather than relying on the Electoral College.

The Electoral college consists of 538 Electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party and given their own says and responsibilities. That being said, I think that getting rid of the Electoral College will eliminate all biased decisions and will create more freedom and responsibilities for the people of the U.S. to use their own judgement and choose who they think will best represent the country. Being in the electoral college and being selected to have a heavy say in who will be chosen is a big responsibilty and in that responsibility are duties to not only look at each candidate with one mind set and one point of view but to make an unbiased judgement. To make an unbiased call would mean to put away all your own thoughts and judgements and really get a good understanding of who the people truly need. Back in 1960, it states that segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. How can we tell that something like this will not happen again? Well if we choose to keep the Electoral College it very well could and the people of the country would not be making decisions for themselves as well.

Most worrying comes from the fear of a tie, in which the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one single vote. That single vote from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters could have as much say as the 55 representatives from California who represent 35 million voters. So therefore the election is really only a few swing voters away from a disaster. Because of the winnertakeall system, candidates really dont spend time campaigning in states they think they have no chance of winning, really only focusing on the bigger states with more votes. This is also unfair because then the people with the right to vote do not get a say in who they want to represent their country. The Electoral college really takes away many rights and freedoms to the people of the U.S. and doesnt give us the chance to have a say. Studies even show that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now!

As well as having such a biased voting system, this is such an unfair system due to the fact the the popular vote winner could loose because of the Electoral College voters. This would be a very bad decision to keep the Electoral College especially if these Electoral voters have had their decision swayed by something. Then we will have a president that is only the president because of some voters biased and unfair judgemented calls. If one Electoral College voter has a certain view on a candidate, they could very well share that and somehow persuade the other voters decisions due to one persons thoughts and points of view on the candidate. One person can easily influence many peoples own judgements, which would cause them to choose poorly and only go under the pressure of that persons thoughts. The Electoral College has so many cons which would make it such a bad decision to keep this system and go by a biased and unfair advantage. So I believe that the best thing for the U.S. voting system would be to abolish the Electoral College and to keep the popular vote system so that everyone has their own say on who will achieve great things for our country.",0
"People all over the world use cars to drive to work or take their children to school. To most people, the automobile is an everyday part of life. But there are downsides to the extreme usage of cars. Some people are noting this trend and are beginning to limit their car usage. Two of the many advantages of limiting the use of cars are that it promotes alternative forms of transportation and it also reduces air pollution.

One positive effect of less cars is the improvement of other forms of transportation. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a carfree town, Vauban, Germany.Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a carfree society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", written by Andrew Selsky, since carfree day began, bicycle and pedestrianfriendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage.

Another major advantage of limiting the use of cars is the reduction of air pollution. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"", Rosenthal writes in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.

Overall, there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars. Not only does it promote and improve other forms of transportation, but it also decreases the amount of smog and air pollution, which are harming our environment.",0
"Dear State Senator, In this essay I will be explaining why the Electoral College shouldn't be kept,and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the United States.

In my opinion we should do a popular vote because we U.S. citizens know what we want. The Electoral College may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly I think that the United States should stick to a popular vote. In an article I read called ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people. I notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote. Isn't one of America's 1 catch phrases "" "" well in this case it seems to be "" "". In this article it also states that in many cases "" "" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please! So if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we. I also think that the Electoral College is unfair because of the winnertakeall system. Candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. While they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes. So in this case I have to agree with Bob Dole: Abolish the Electoral College!

I also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the Electoral Collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash. They obviously don't care and I see this as completely irrational and unfair. I know that may use the electoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lowerincome families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lowerincome families how are they going to live? How are they going to survive.""Remember "" power to the people"".",0
"Dear State Senator, I think that our president's should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.

The president's have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn't have to wait on the Electoral College. Such as paragraph 9 says, ""Thanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could of been the president but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him it ended up as a waste because the voting didn't get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College. What doesn't make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors. What's the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don't even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" To me they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting just to be voting.

The president would know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States. The electoral college votes won't help them know who is really for them and who's not because if someone win over electoral votes there are going to be people out there mad about the fact that they had won. This will make people not want to vote at all because 9 times out of 10 the person they are voting for gone lose. The electoral college just makes it difficult for the people that are running for president. I'm not saying that it should be easy to just become something big, but if you worked hard enough I think that you should be honored enough to become president through popular votes. This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it.

I hope what I have really proved my argument that we should change the way a president is chosen so it can be fair to everyone. I think this will make the incoming president feel confident in himself to make this happen.",0

[Senator's Address]
[City, State, ZIP]

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing today to discuss an important aspect of our electoral process: the Electoral College. As a concerned citizen and advocate for fair and efficient democratic systems, I am of the opinion that we should maintain the Electoral College rather than change to a system of popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. In this letter, I will present arguments in favor of the Electoral College, using information from multiple sources.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article, the winner of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, resulting in a clear victory. This is due to the winner-take-all system adopted by most states, where a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Though a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is theoretically possible, it is highly unlikely. This certainty prevents prolonged disputes over the outcome, as witnessed in the 2000 election. Changing to a system of direct popular vote could invite more disputes and potentially undermine faith in the democratic process.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Judge Posner. No region in our diverse nation has enough electoral votes to singlehandedly elect a President. Therefore, candidates are required to campaign across multiple regions and consider the interests of diverse groups of voters. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from assuming office and helps build a sense of national unity. Every region and its unique concerns matter in the Presidential election under the Electoral College system, thereby promoting a more balanced representation of our nation's interests.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, as explained by Plumer. This ensures that voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more thoughtful voters who are actively engaged in the election process. The influence of swing states in determining the outcome of the election encourages candidates to address the concerns of a broad range of voters. This system discourages candidates from neglecting certain regions or demographics, ensuring that the President is accountable to a wide cross-section of the populace.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores a measure of balance to our political system, particularly for large states. By design, smaller states have a proportionately larger number of electoral votes compared to their population. This balances the influence of larger states, which can lose some weight in the political process due to mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the needs and concerns of citizens across states of varying sizes, creating a more inclusive campaign process.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, as outlined by Judge Posner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can be time-consuming, costly, and potentially divisive. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner by awarding electoral votes based on plurality. This eliminates the need for additional electoral processes and allows for a smooth and efficient transition of power.

While there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College, such as those highlighted by Plumer, it is important to consider the practical reasons for retaining this system. The Electoral College provides certainty, ensures trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These practical advantages make a strong case for maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College continues to serve an essential role in our democratic system. Its benefits outweigh the perceived faults of the system. I urge you to consider the practical reasons for the retention of the Electoral College in any deliberations on electoral reform. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"The passages provided discuss the advantages of limiting car usage in different cities around the world. One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Passage 5, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, these emissions can be reduced, contributing to efforts to combat climate change. Passage 9 also mentions that the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting ""car reduced"" communities to reduce emissions.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods. Passage 4 discusses the concept of ""smart planning"" in which suburbs are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach encourages people to use public transportation instead of private cars, reducing traffic congestion and promoting a more efficient use of space and resources. Passage 26 talks about a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This event promotes alternative modes of transportation and reduces the reliance on cars.

Limiting car usage can also have health benefits. Passage 18 mentions that during the driving ban in Paris due to smog, congestion reduced by 60 percent. This reduction in traffic can lead to improved air quality in cities, which is beneficial for people's respiratory health. Passage 33 suggests that the decrease in car ownership and driving in the United States may have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life. Passage 3 features a resident of the car-free community in Germany, who expresses being happier without a car. By reducing the dependency on cars, people can enjoy quieter and more peaceful streets with less noise and pollution. Passage 28 describes the improvements made in Bogota, such as the construction of bicycle paths, parks, and sports centers, as well as the replacement of uneven sidewalks. These changes enhance the livability of cities and make them more enjoyable for residents.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of alternative transportation methods, health benefits, and an improved quality of life. By adopting smart planning strategies, encouraging the use of public transportation, and creating car-free spaces, cities can become more sustainable, efficient, and livable.",1
"Dear dumb Republican , The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it. I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways.

The first reason for why I despise this system is because we have had people with more than half of the country voting for them not be elected President. This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes. If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes. In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President. This happened during the presidential Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President. It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.

With the Electoral College it is more likely that a tie will happen. This is beacuse there are only 538 electoral votes, which is a lot less than 300 million popular votes, for every U.S. citizen. If there is a tie, then the Senate and House of Representatives has to do all this stupid stuff to figure out who wins.

In the process of the Electoral College, the voters in the smaller states are given more power than those in the larger states. Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depending on the size of the state's population. WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do. Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.

Because of the Electoral College, Presidential candidates spend a large portion of their time in ""Swing States,"" like Ohio or Florida, and little or no time to states with predictable outcomes. A swing state is a state that could go either way in the election, so the candidates spend a lot of time convincing it's populants to vote for them, because of the winnertakesall method. This is unfair to the states with predicted outcomes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is old, useless, irrational, and hurtful to our country. This is why we should abolish it.",0
"While there have been presidents that have run without earning the popular vote, it does not mean that the Electoral College is inefficient, bad, or unnecessary. The Electoral College, chosen by our founding fathers, is a process in which people elect for electors. Then the electors vote for the president. Each state gets a certain number of electors, or electoral votes, depending on their population. This way, no single group of people can sway the voting largely. Instead, only the state would be effected. Without a doubt, the Electoral College has been working well for centuries, and I see no good reason to change it.

For starters, it is much easier than a popular vote to decide. Yes, the chance for a tie is there, but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays. Counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty, even right here in the Sun Shine State. Imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one! Even though a tie is more likely this way, the odds of a tie are so rare, what does it matter?

Another truly great thing is the fact that any president must have appeal to all states, or at least most. Having the favor in the south and concentrating it there will not give you more votes. In fact, it is more likely you will not be president if you yield strongly to any one region. Doing so may lose you many votes in other areas that may be difficult to recapture. If a president was for say, leaning towards big old California and Florida, but not going very much for the other states, then yes, he may win many, many votes from California and Florida and possibly win the election, if it was a popular vote. But this is not the case. In an electoral votes, winning all votes in a few states is hardly useful. That, of course, plays majorly into elections, which is a reason why some of your favorite presidential candidates didn't win.

Another great thing I am to mention is loss of plurality. What if my buddy and I each got only 40% of the votes. The other guy in Tex. got the other 20%. Who would win? In the Electoral College, the Tex. dude may win a few votes in each state, but rarely will he win any. With the Electoral College, other minor candidates are less likely to screw the whole thing up.

It is true there have been faults. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO have all antagonized the Electoral College. One reason is that electoral do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning. If my vote gets some Bob McShnuffle into the electoral voting system, but he votes for someone other than my choice, then there is going to be major pandemonium. Is it fair that your vote and so many others gets flipped just because Bob McShnuffle was unhappy with that president? Perhaps, but this does not happen often. Usually, it does not cause too much of a balance tipping. But the true problem is the word of the people. We have so many speakers for us, but they don't always say the right things that we want. Fortunately, these incidents do not happen all the time. To fret over such things only offers you more problems and less solutions. By having an elector, a representative, someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him. Instead, this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict.

On that happy note, I must mention the electoral college is not perfect. Nothing is. But it is easier than popular voting, counts all states and regions, and naturally avoids runoffs. Of course, its still got its flaws. But you have to admit that those founding fathers did pretty good. Arguably, it has been the best way for the presidential election, and it still is...",0
"Many people believe that owning and using a car or other motorized vehicles is an advantage. But is it really? Citizens might be able to get somewhere faster or not have to exert the energy to get there. But is it worth polluting the air, taking up all that space and creating traffic and frustrated citizens, and creating the mindset of a lazy, human being? Maybe instead of spending money on a car, citizens wouldn't be in as much debt, some kids might have college already paid for, and some citizens have their housing paid for. Therefor, this is making happier, stressfree, citizens.

The pollution of the air is a major argument for people who support the nonusage of cars or other motorized vehicles. In Source 1: In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal claims that motorized vehicles play a major part in the pollution of the air. Rosenthal says that Europe is responsible 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the United States is responsible for up to 50 percent.

Most of the time, traffic causes a driver to be frustrated. What causes traffic? Vehicles. So why does everybody drive them? In small, wellpopulated suburbs, traffic is a major issue. With the dense population and the majority of those citizens driving vehicles, traffic is very easily created. Thus, making more citizens frustrated and creating road rage. Road rage also causes more accidents which causes more deaths. Making driving, a dangerous thing. Although, citizens still drive motorized vehicles. Most of the time it is to get to a certain place in a short amount of time, but if a destination is closer than one mile, there is no excuse to use a vehicle to get there. But most citizens do. This creates a lazy mind set.

The average cost of a brand new car is roughly 30,000. If citizens avoid buying a car, it would be a great benefit for them. 30,000 can payoff college, or help with bills or debt, or payoff housing. With more money, this creates happier, and less stressed citizens.

The creation of ""car dues"", and ""carfree days"" could make a huge difference in the environment, economy, safety, traffic, and even the health and stress of a citizen. Although most people still believe that having a car is an advantage, it can be. But not having a car or not using a car as much is a much greater advantage. Not just to an individual, but to society as a whole.",0
"Thier are a bunch of reasons for not using a car I can name you 10 off the top of my head. It limits pollution saves money great excerise their multiple reasons not to drive a car everyday.

For example if you limit your car use to 3 times a week you would save a ton of money. Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article ""Pairs bans driving due to smog"" that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france after 5 day of intensifying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car accident.

In the passage ""car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" that they for one whole day dont use cars. They instead ride bikes every where because they want to reduce smog as Pairs wants to. In the passage it says that since its such a big hit that two more colombian cites, Cail and Valledupar joined the event. They have built over 118 miles of bike paths, the most of any latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. It also says that ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Also that day lets people probaly enjoy life way more because all you can do is ride bike and walk so they probaly go on adventures.

The final reason why you limit car use is their would be less of a chance for you to get hurt or even worse. Thier are many accident evey year because of drunk and reckless drivers many have lost their lives to idiots on the road. Thier was a story on the news that three teenage kids died in a car accident because they where under the influnce of drugs. They could have hurt other people the reporter said they crashed into a store and the store owner almost got hurt. Those kids almost took someone else life which is scary but if you limit your car use their wont be that many accidents.

All in all if you just limit your use of the car you can be helping out a bunch. The pollution can be reduced not as many car accidents you can save your self some money. Also you can get more excersie in if you dont use your car that often.",0
"Title: The Benefits of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
The increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of car usage on the environment has led to a change in mindset among citizens and policymakers. Several instances around the world have demonstrated the advantages of limiting car usage. This essay will explore the benefits of reducing the dependency on cars, such as improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting healthier lifestyles, and enhancing community connectivity.

Body:

1. Improved Air Quality and Reduced Emissions:
a. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions.
b. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of these emissions.
c. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number reaches up to 50%.
d. Limiting car usage can significantly decrease emissions and improve air quality.
e. Examples like Paris implementing driving bans during smog episodes highlight the effectiveness of reducing car usage in combating pollution.
f. By adopting car-reduced communities, emissions can be reduced, benefiting both the environment and public health.

2. Healthier Lifestyles:
a. Limiting car usage encourages alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit.
b. Active modes of transportation contribute to better physical health.
c. In Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited, the majority of residents do not own cars and report being happier and less stressed.
d. Pedestrian-friendly environments and the availability of public transportation in car-reduced communities promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles.

3. Enhanced Community Connectivity:
a. Car-reduced communities are designed with compact layouts and accessible public transportation.
b. This planning approach encourages residents to walk or bike to nearby amenities, reducing the need for long-distance driving.
c. Placed a walk away from residential areas, stores and services promote community interaction and reduce reliance on cars for daily needs.
d. The success of car-free day initiatives, such as those in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrates the viability of alternative modes of transportation and the potential for enhanced community cohesion.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various cities and communities around the world. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of healthier lifestyles, and enhanced community connectivity all contribute to a more sustainable future. As governments and citizens embrace this shift towards car-reduced communities, we can look forward to a cleaner and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations.",1
"After the research I have done I think that changing the system would be a good idea because of the followingg reasons, its not really fair because your not actually voting for the president, but for a slate of electors, also becuse of the candidates are more focused on the bigg states, and the swing states.

The first reason that changing the system is a good idea is that lots of people think that it is unfair. Like in source 2 by bradford Plumer, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John kerry, You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" but if the electors dont win the statewide election he wouldnt get the votes, so its like your vote didn't even count. The winner take all system is unfair because your actualy not choosing your own president.

The next problem are the big staes. The candidates dont spend many time is the small state because they now that those votes won't really help them win so the go to the bigger states where they now they will get more votes. In source 3 by Richard A. Posner says "" a large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state dose."" For example in 2012 obama won the votes from florida, get got 29 electoral votes. But if he were to go to a small state and won he would only get a few votes, so its not fair for the smaller states and it's not equal.

The finall issue are the swing states. Candidates focus more on the tossup states. In these states they spend more time and give out more information because in these states the people really pay colse attention to the campaign. The candidates dont spend any time int the staes they now they no chances for winning, that why during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all!

In response, based from the following informatom given I think that The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It should not be the elecotal votes that matter it should be the peoples votes. Also some states dojnt even hear from the candidates because they are busy with the big staes and trying to win over the swing states. If you do change the system you will make lots of people happy and I think that it will work out well for the U.S and everything will be equal.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage has erupted since the year 2005. America's love affair with vehicles has been like the love of their children. Most people cant get any where without a car they begin to believe that without a car you cat go anywhere, but if they look at the bright side America has many uses of transportation such as bus, train, plane, car pool, hiking, skating, bicycle, and walking. By using these ways of transportation many places around the world will find that is much easier then using a car everyday maybe if we tried to make these federal transportation toals in our city then maybe air pollution will decrease or even go away completely. There has been many improvement campaigns around the world such as Bogota's day without cars and Paris's driving ban due to smog. Many counties, cities, and states around the world are finding ways of transportation without cars and we should to. A world without cars is a utopia of a new way of living because many people are much happier this way.

As a result, to a world without cars Vauban, Germany's people has said a life without cars is wonderful even if it takes a little more time to get places. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families donot own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainor and a mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor""Rosenthal.3. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal's statistic vaughn's citizens are happy in this new way of life they have learned that a life without cars can be different but happier so that they can go through out their busy days without hearing the sound of an ongiong car zooming pass them as they walk the streets of their cities.""vaughn's streets a COMPLETELY car free besides the tram to downtown Feiburg and a few streets on the edge of the community""Rosenthal.2. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal vaughn's streets being car free is a easier life there is less traffic while trying to get to work in the morning, or even trying to get home, and picking up your kids in the afternoon.

""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""Duffer.10. Paris being near pollution has caused them to enforce a partial driving ban on its cities people. In my oppinion Paris going into over pollution would cause it population to die to the lost of many lives because of air pollution. After 5 days of intesifying the smog congestion decresased and there was many people rerouting their daily lifes to acounter the partial ban on their daily lifes. ""On monday many motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day""Duffer.11. Almost 4,000 motorist were fined that day because they did'nt want to listen to a simple order. Due to the partial ban the congestion of motor vehicles decreased by 60 percent in the capital of france. This ban is a good way to take away the stress of putting gas in your vehicles, finding someone to fix your car when it has broken down and a possible cure to lowering the global effect of air pollution.

As a result, to America's campaigns and organizations to keep U.S. drivers off the street and on public transportation the number of people driving and the number of people getting their license has decresased since 2009. Demographic shifts in the driving population has caused the population of many places around the world to stop driving cars and find new ways to get around. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and federal transportation toals, that mattering on its out come, may become a law throught the whole of the United States within the next six years. This law may cause many U.S. citizens to become upset because of the restrictment of something they use through out their daily lifes. Most people in the U.S. think that driving is the only way to get around but there are many ways of transportation mattering on where your going and how fast you want to get there.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our privilege to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurrence of a runoff election, runoff elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.

Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selection of people to make the final decision of millions Source 1. The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to allude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?

Unquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is absurd to remove americans right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a runoff election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overlycautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.

You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutionalright to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcomePlumer 13, 14. Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.",0
"Dear United States Senator, Voting in the United States of America has always been the same way, by using the Electoral Collage to cast votes for the presidency. Now, the Presidential Election should be based on popular vote rather than using the Electoral Collage. It is an unfair, unbalanced method for determining the president of the United States. Every president changes history, so if the wrong one is put into office, American history can be altered.

An unfair, preposterous method is sure to have great detestment. Say one candidate had the majority of votes from the American people, by popularity. Yet, the other candidate had the majority of electoral votes from the Electoral Collage. The candidate who received votes from the Electoral Collage wins, even though his opponent had the American peoples' majority vote. This happened in the year 2000, when nominee Al Gore had more popular votes the George W. Bush, yet fewer electoral votes, allowing Bush to be president. Even more so, when voting for a presidential candidate, one is in truth voting for a late of electors, rather than voting for the candidate straight on. Source: 3 If the electors vote one way, when the majority of a state really wants to have the opposing side, there is nothing that can be done to change the electoral votes. Some may argue this is a fair method, but in reality, it is not. Source: 2 No American should be misprepresented when voting for a presidential nominee.

Unbalanced voting is sure to be an uproar, especailly when speaking about the president of the United States. California has the most electoral votes, stacking up at 55 votes in the Electoral Collage. Wyoming, along with other states, has a mere three votes. A grand total of 538 Electoral votes is what results from adding up all states votes, but 270 is needed to win the presidency. It won't matter who has the popular vote, all that matters is the person who wins the electoral vote. On the other hand, people who live in states with small populations may argue this is a more representing way of voting for president. But it really isn't balanced. The state may have a popular vote towards one side, but when the electoral voter palces his vote, he may choose to betray the people of the state. People cannot change the electoral vote if they are misrepresenting their state. That doesn't sound balanced or equal at all. The scales should not tip towards the lighter side. If the election was determined based on popular vote, rather than the Electoral Collage, then the American people would recieve a more accurate determination of presidency rather than what is already in place.

An unfair, unbalanced mehtod should be thrown out the window, trashed. People want want people want, and should be fairly and equally treated to reflect thier true intents. The Electoral Collage is an unfair, unbalaned election strategy that should be disregarded. We should change this election to using popular vote to acurratly, justly portray the wants and political views of the people living in the United States, where the citizens have power in determining what they choose happens in the counrty. The land of the free, America, should have free say in choosing the president. Abolish the Electoral Collage, and instead put in its place the means of popular voting.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerly, an American Citizen.",0
"Dear Senator, If one could sum up the definition of the Electoral College in a few words, those words would be unessasary and room for error. The Electoral College was established by our fore fathers in the constitution. Paragraph one in What is the Electoral College by the Office of the Federal Register states ""A compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" It is more than possible that a change in our voting system could better america in all kinds of ways.

I believe that the electoral College takes away the peoples opinion in a way just discreet enough to still call it a democracy. The people still vote and determine the overall outcome of the election, But with an electoral college, there is more then enough room for error. One argument against the Electoral College is in the very purpose of the system. The people votes go to an electors slate that share the same view as you, then they vote for a candidate. This is opposed to the peoples vote going directly to the candidate. This method of voting is if not purposeless then problematic. Electors can betrey your trust and vote for the opposite candidate. A statement from bradford Plumers' The Indefensible Electoral College says ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" In America our society is based off of freedom and the electoral college is not promoting it. Please keep in mind that the legislature is nearly completly responsable for choosing our electors. At any election they could defy the peoples choice. excerpt from The Indefensible Electoral states ""back in 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature neary succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Electors have occasionally been know for simply refusing to vote for their party's candidate. If this is freedom to vote then there undoubtingly needs to be a change in the near future.

candles like the one thay occurred in 1960 rarely happen, but whos to say that it could not happen in the future. Our presidential election is practically based off of trust in our government. The Electoral college does recognize voters from each region of the county but due to the way the system is set up, it does a poor job interpreting the votes of the people.

A quote from In Defence of the Electoral College by Richard A. Posner states ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popluar vote"" This happened as recently as the election of 2000 Then ask yourself what would really be the harm of ignoring the Electoral College. It only would make the outcome clearer.

The American elections differ from most countrys in the way that we are a democracy. we the people can vote. we the people have individual voices that are the composition of the country. The elector college does not oppose this. But rather is opening the doors for corruption. Taking away the Electoral College and replacing it with popular vote, is simply clarifying the peoples decisions, and the peoples decisions is nothing less then America itself.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in the Presidential Election Process

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of a direct election by popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system offers numerous benefits and safeguards to maintain the integrity of our democratic process.

First, it is essential to understand the purpose and history of the Electoral College. Our founding fathers established it as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President through a popular vote. This system combines the will of the people with the need to balance regional interests and protect the rights of smaller states (Office of the Federal Register, passage 1).

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome (Judge Richard A. Posner, passage 18). By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of the electoral votes, this system ensures that the President's election is not solely determined by popular vote percentages or a small margin. It helps prevent lengthy and contentious disputes over the election results, such as the one witnessed in 2000. The electoral vote structure, with its winner-take-all principle in most states, guarantees a clear outcome and reduces the likelihood of a tied or inconclusive result.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions across the country (Judge Richard A. Posner, passage 19). By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, this system prevents them from focusing solely on densely populated areas and ignoring the concerns of smaller states. It ensures that candidates pay attention to the needs and interests of citizens across the nation, rather than concentrating solely on swing states or metropolitan areas.

Another valid point in favor of the Electoral College system is its ability to give prominence to swing states (Judge Richard A. Posner, passage 20). By allocating electoral votes in a winner-take-all manner, candidates are encouraged to campaign vigorously in states where the election outcome is uncertain. This fosters a more engaged and thoughtful voting population, as swing state citizens become more informed about the candidates' policies and proposals.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores a balance of power between large and small states (Judge Richard A. Posner, passage 21). While large states benefit from more electoral votes due to their population, the system ensures that smaller states receive a fair share of influence within the presidential election process. This principle aligns with the fundamental principles of our Constitution, which explicitly protects the rights of all states regardless of size.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for costly and complex run-off elections (Judge Richard A. Posner, passage 22). By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, this system prevents prolonged election processes and reduces the risk of political instability caused by prolonged uncertainty. A clear winner emerges, enabling a smooth transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides vital safeguards and advantages to our presidential election process. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages active campaigning in swing states, restores equilibrium between large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. These benefits, coupled with the historical significance of the Electoral College as a compromise by our founding fathers, make a strong case for its continuation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the reasons outlined above and support the retention of the Electoral College in the future. Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Sincerely,

"  Pioneering Sustainable Urban Living  In today's rapidly urbanizing world, the concept of car-free cities is gaining traction as a forward-thinking approach to address the multifaceted challenges of urban living. These cities propose a transformation where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a vision of urban living that prioritizes sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, but transitioning to this model is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the primary benefits of car-free cities lies in their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the global fight against climate change. By embracing pedestrian and cyclist safety, car-free cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health. Reduced air pollution levels can lead to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being among urban residents.  These cities also make efficient use of urban space, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Traffic congestion, a common urban woe, is notably reduced in car-free cities, resulting in shorter commutes and a more peaceful daily urban experience for residents and commuters. Additionally, the financial burden of car ownership is lightened as residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges. Resistance to change is a significant obstacle, as many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. Public transportation infrastructure must be significantly expanded and enhanced to provide convenient alternatives to private cars. The economic impact on businesses that depend on car-dependent customers cannot be ignored, and addressing this impact is a crucial aspect of the transition. Finally, the reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure.  To successfully realize car-free cities, strategies include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods like walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness. These steps can help cities work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation, and car-free cities become a beacon of sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living.  In conclusion, car-free cities present a promising vision for a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal for urban planners and communities looking to build a better future.",1
"We all plan to get cars when we get our licenses right? Wrong! The relationship between people and cars throughout the Earth is changing with fewer people buying cars and governments supporting the use of more ecofriendly methods of transportation. Two advantages of this change that I would like to point out is first the improvement in health, and second the fact green house gasses have gone down. These may seem like great ideas, but you may be asking yourself are such advantages possible?

beginning with the lack of pollution, cars can produce Carbon dioxide which causes problems in the atmosphere. The gas traps sunlight creating greenhouse gasses which is responsible for global warming. This would cause problems for future generations with an increase in flooding and other factors that can destroy areas of living, not to mention the fact breathing in the fumes is bad for health. The scary part about the relationship between green house gasses and cars is that twelve percent of green house gasses caused by cars are in Europe. This may no frighten you, but when you take into account fifty percent of green house gasses lie in the U.S., you realize how serious and frightening the situation really is.

Another benefit of the lack of car usage is the improvement of public health. It's known by many scientist and psychologist that an increase in stress is bad for health and can lower a person's life expectancy. In Vaubun Germany a mother's words about their Vaubun program was ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" meanwhile in Bogota, Columbia a business man said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" during Bogota's carfree day program. Aside from the stress, people are getting far more fit as they walk or take a bike to their destinations, even in large cities like New York where you'll see people joining bike programs. Bicycle lanes are increasing greatly and in Bogota, 118 miles have already been built.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that out our world is improving. The awareness of government and the people has lead into the creation of bicycle lanes, a lowering in the stress level of the people, and a decrease in green house gasses. This will in turn provide a better future for countless generations of people throughout the entire planet. It's as Bill Ford, executive of the Ford Motor company stated ""pedestria, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to uphold this system as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital safeguard for preserving the integrity and fairness of our elections.

The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between congressional selection and a direct popular vote, plays a crucial role in the election process. It ensures that every state has a voice and prevents major population centers from dominating the outcome of presidential elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the results. With the winner-take-all system in place, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps to avoid uncertainty and strengthens the legitimacy of the elected president.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters a sense of unity and ensures that a president has trans-regional appeal. By requiring candidates to have support from diverse regions, it prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and neglecting the interests of less populous regions. This inclusiveness is crucial for effective governance and the representation of all Americans.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election is likely to be decided. In doing so, it encourages candidates to engage directly with voters, allowing for a more informed and thoughtful decision by those who have the greatest impact on the outcome. This system ensures that all voters, regardless of their state's size or political leanings, have a say in the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate skews political power in favor of smaller states, the Electoral College compensates by giving more attention to larger states during campaigns. This balanced allocation of attention ensures that the interests and concerns of both large and small states are considered.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can greatly complicate the electoral process. By consistently producing a clear winner, this system brings stability and efficiency to the presidential election process. It prevents prolonged periods of uncertainty and allows our government to function smoothly.

While critics argue that a popular vote system would be fairer, it must be acknowledged that the Electoral College requires candidates to campaign in diverse areas and consider the views of all Americans. A popular vote system would place undue emphasis on highly populated areas, potentially alienating and disenfranchising voters in other areas of the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a crucial mechanism for preserving the fairness and integrity of our presidential elections. It ensures that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a voice and that candidates must consider the interests of all Americans. I respectfully urge you to defend this system and resist any attempts to replace it with a popular vote system. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider these points as you make decisions on issues pertaining to the Electoral College.

"The articles explain that the limited use of cars or automobiles is to our advantage. Two reasons that support this theory is that one you won't have to stress about buying a car and making sure everyone has one, and second you will help to protect the environment from the harmful gases of automobiles.

The limitation on cars may have its advantages because, among the billions of people on this earth many of them own cars. Many vehicles give off harmful pollution gases to the environment and can cause many endangering problems to people as well. Evidence from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" can support the following... ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidence supports the fact that there was enough smog in the air that led to the prohibition of cars for a limited time. This is to the people's advantage because they were now able to breathe fresh air instead of smog. Another piece of evidence also comes from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog...The smog rivaled with Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" This evidence shows that smog causes pollution which is harmful in many ways. It also shows just how much of a difference just five days of limitation on vehicles can help reduce pollution. So the sooner people can see what banning cars can do to their health and wellbeing then maybe they will see what the love and cherish so much, can actually be hurting them.

Car limitations may be the best thing yet for America and other places in the world. By banning cars we could reduce a lot of stress and the worry about the payments and supplying the vehicle with gas. Evidence that can support this comes from source 4: "" The End of Car Culture"" ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995....recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This explains that many Americans cannot even afford cars. So they go about their days just fine taking public transportation or receiving rides from friends. So by banning cars we could actually reduce the stress of not having a car or making the payments on them... plus we would have better health. Out of the estimated 7 billion people on this earth, it is not guranteed that all of them around the ages of 15 and above are equipped with a a vehicel of their own. Evidence from Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" can support the following "" What most intrigues me is the rates of car ownership per househols and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" Thi just goes to show you that not only are cars bad for the enviornment and people's health but, they are bad financially for people to maintain and keep up. The automobile is what changed America back in the day. But it is causing some damae to us now.

Car limitations have some advantages that are probably very beneifcial to us. We may think that cars are our only way of transportaion and that you need them to survive but, that is not necessarily true. Cars are great but up to a certain extent.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the future of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. It is important to consider the arguments both for and against its retention. While some argue that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system, I believe that it serves a crucial purpose in our democracy and should be maintained. 

One of the key functions of the Electoral College is to ensure certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the Electoral College system guarantees that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. It provides a clear and decisive result, preventing the need for run-off elections, as mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures a stable and efficient democratic process.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president,"" as explained by Judge Posner. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents any single region from dominating the electoral process. This ensures that candidates focus on the interests of all regions, rather than just the ones from which they can secure overwhelming support. In doing so, it guarantees that the president represents the entire nation and not just certain factions or regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states, as argued by Judge Richard A. Posner. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election and, therefore, voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates. This encourages thoughtful voting and allows for the most affected and informed voters to have a greater say in determining the presidency.

The Electoral College also helps balance the political weight of large and small states, as Judge Richard A. Posner highlights. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as dictated in the Constitution, gives smaller states in terms of population less representation in the political process. However, through the Electoral College, these smaller states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigning. This ensures they have a voice in the selection of the president, preventing larger states from completely overshadowing their interests.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented by Bradford Plumer, it is important to consider the practical reasons for retaining it. The system provides stability, prevents run-off elections, ensures broad appeal, and represents the interests of both large and small states. These practical reasons demonstrate that the Electoral College continues to serve a vital role in our democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place for the election of the President of the United States. It serves as a crucial compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, providing certainty, fairness, and representation for all states. The practical reasons outlined above demonstrate the value and importance of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Yours sincerely,

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments advocating for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College system ensures a fair and balanced representation of all states and is vital for our democratic process.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, is a compromise between election by Congress and election by a popular vote. The process consists of the selection of electors, voting by the electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress (Office of the Federal Register). This system ensures that each state has a voice in the election, preventing larger states from dominating the outcome.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. While disputes can arise, such as in the 2000 election, the winner-take-all nature of most states' electoral votes ensures a clear result (Judge Richard A. Posner). This is particularly important for maintaining stability and avoiding prolonged disputes over the popular vote. The Electoral College system inherently incorporates the will of the people, as the slate of electors chosen by the popular vote represents the interests of the voters.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal by requiring them to seek support from a wide range of states (Judge Richard A. Posner). Without this requirement, candidates might focus solely on states with the largest population, neglecting the concerns and needs of smaller states. The Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates address the issues faced by diverse regions and work towards policies that benefit the entire nation.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This results in more attention to these states, allowing voters to make informed decisions and feel engaged in the electoral process (Judge Richard A. Posner). Without the Electoral College, campaign efforts would be concentrated solely on the most populous states, leaving other states overlooked and making voters feel disenfranchised.

The Electoral College also provides important balance by restoring weight to large states that may lose representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate (Judge Richard A. Posner). By allocating electoral votes based on population, the system ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states. This prevents a focus solely on densely populated areas and allows voices from across the country to be heard.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, reducing complications in the presidential election process (Judge Richard A. Posner). It ensures that a clear winner emerges, preventing potential gridlock and delays caused by a lack of a majority vote.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages voter participation, the fact that half the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election proves otherwise (Judge Richard A. Posner). Voters in presidential elections are motivated by their desire to express their political preferences, even if their individual vote may not ultimately sway the national outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has served our nation well for centuries, providing stability, fairness, and a balanced representation of states. It ensures that all parts of the country have a say in electing the President of the United States. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of our democracy.

I urge you to consider my viewpoint and support the retention of the Electoral College system. It is essential in safeguarding the interests of all states and ensuring a fair electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for society and the environment. This can be seen in various cities and countries where efforts have been made to reduce reliance on automobiles, such as in Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia. These examples demonstrate that smart planning and alternative transportation options can create numerous benefits for communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Automobiles are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, specifically in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, significant reductions in emissions can be achieved.

Another advantage is improved air quality. Smog and pollution caused by cars can have detrimental effects on public health. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to severe smog. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent, and the city saw improvements in air quality (Duffer). Car-free days in Bogota also demonstrated the positive impact on air pollution, with the streets being noticeably devoid of traffic jams (Selsky). Limiting car usage promotes alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, which contribute to cleaner air.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have social and economic advantages. By reducing car ownership, individuals can experience a decrease in stress and an increase in happiness, as seen in Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Rosenthal). This shift can create a safer and more pleasant living environment, free from noise and pollution. Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the revitalization of center cities, making them more appealing and drawing people back in (Rosenthal). This can stimulate economic growth, with the development of new businesses and improved infrastructure.

Critics may argue that limiting car usage restricts personal freedom and convenience. However, the rise of technology and alternative transportation options, such as bike-sharing programs and car-sharing services, have provided viable alternatives that offer convenience and flexibility. Additionally, the demographic shift observed in younger generations, where driving and car ownership are becoming less important, suggests that there may be a cultural change in progress (Rosenthal). This shift towards shared transportation and alternative modes aligns with the goals of reducing emissions and creating more sustainable communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and positive social and economic impacts make a compelling case for implementing measures to promote alternative transportation options. As demonstrated by examples in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, creating car-free or low-car communities can result in a happier, healthier, and more sustainable future.",1
"Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This approach not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate air pollution, but it also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage.

One such example is the town of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Streets in the town are completely car-free, except for a few essential thoroughfares. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars to move to this car-free community. The absence of cars has created a peaceful environment, with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children replacing the noise of car engines. Vauban is part of a growing trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from car use, as a component of ""smart planning.""

The advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond improved quality of life. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By reducing car usage, we can drastically reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can also help address air pollution issues, which are particularly severe in major cities like Paris. Implementing driving bans, like the one enforced in Paris due to smog, can significantly reduce congestion and improve air quality.

Promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, is an important aspect of limiting car usage. Initiatives like car-free days, as seen in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to use alternative methods of transportation, leading to a significant decrease in traffic congestion. Public transportation systems play a vital role in reducing car dependence and promoting accessibility. Efforts are being made worldwide to make suburbs more compact and suitable for walking, with stores located within walking distance rather than being distant and car-dependent. These smart planning strategies aim to create communities that are less reliant on cars, helping to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles.

The decrease in car usage is not solely attributed to economic factors, such as the recession. Sociologists suggest that cultural shifts, driven by factors like urban renewal, advancements in technology, and changing preferences of younger generations, play a significant role in the decline. Young people, in particular, are becoming less interested in car ownership and prioritize alternative forms of transportation. As the next generation begins to make lifestyle choices that align with sustainability and environmental consciousness, the decline in car culture is expected to continue.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, decreased traffic congestion, and promotion of healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Examples from around the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in creating more livable and environmentally-friendly communities. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, we can pave the way for a future with reduced car dependence and a healthier planet.",1
"Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.

In the article, carFree cities it talks a lot about the advantages of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage ""Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usage, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life."" Moreover, in the passage it also says ""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" Furthermore, ""In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway."" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.

By limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s."" Moreover, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths."" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly evident in various parts of the world. In Germany, the community of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free lifestyle, with only two places to park for the entire community. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move there. The residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without the need for a car. This experiment in low-car suburban life is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, as suburbs are being redesigned to be more compact and accessible to public transportation, with fewer spaces for parking. This trend is a response to the negative impact of cars on greenhouse gas emissions, as passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make significant progress in reducing pollution and combating climate change.

Another example of limiting car usage can be seen in the city of Paris, where driving was partially banned due to severe smog. The ban targeted vehicles with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates on alternate days. The result was a significant decrease in congestion, with traffic levels decreasing by 60 percent. This demonstrates that reducing car usage can have a direct and immediate impact on air pollution. While there were some inconveniences for delivery companies, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and vehicles with three or more passengers. The success of the ban shows that individuals are willing to adopt alternative modes of transportation when necessary.

Colombia has also implemented a car-free day in its capital city, Bogota, for three consecutive years. The goal of this initiative is to promote alternative transportation options and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians have participated in hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, resulting in eerily empty streets. This program has not only been successful in Bogota but has also spread to other cities in Colombia and other countries as well. The event has attracted the attention of municipal authorities from around the world, as they witness the potential for a revolutionary change. This demonstrates that limiting car usage is not just a local phenomenon, but a global movement towards a more sustainable future.

The shift in American behavior towards limiting car usage is also becoming evident. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. This decrease in driving is attributed to various factors, such as the recession and the rise of telecommuting and shared transportation. This cultural shift has positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States. However, it could have negative implications for the car industry, as companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, decreases air pollution, and promotes a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. The examples provided from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States demonstrate the potential for a widespread shift towards alternative transportation options. By implementing smart planning and creating communities that are less dependent on cars, we can create a better future for ourselves and for the planet.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages to both individuals and the environment. This is evident in various examples from around the world, such as the car-free community in Vauban, Germany, the driving ban in Paris due to smog, and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia. These cases demonstrate the positive outcomes of reducing car dependency, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity. By adopting similar measures to limit car usage, cities and individuals can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In many cities, car emissions contribute significantly to air pollution, leading to a range of health problems. The case of Paris enforcing a driving ban to clear the air of smog highlights the immediate positive impact of reducing car usage. As a result of the ban, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent, and the smog levels decreased significantly. Similarly, Bogota's car-free day resulted in millions of Colombians utilizing alternative transportation methods, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. These initiatives demonstrate how reducing car usage can lead to cleaner air and a healthier environment for all.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the mitigation of traffic congestion. Many cities around the world suffer from congested roads, causing frustration and wasting precious time. The example of Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited and alternatives like public transportation and cycling are encouraged, proves that reducing car usage can result in more accessible and efficient transportation systems. In Vauban, streets are car-free, except for the main thoroughfare with a tram to downtown Freiburg. This smart planning approach, adopting a mix of walking, cycling, and public transport, has significantly reduced traffic congestion within the community. By implementing similar strategies in cities, traffic congestion can be reduced, allowing for smoother and quicker movement of people and goods.

Aside from the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage also promotes increased physical activity. In Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, residents enjoy walking and cycling on pedestrian-friendly streets. The community is designed to have stores and amenities within walking distance, encouraging people to lead active lifestyles. Similarly, Bogota's car-free day encourages citizens to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, promoting physical fitness. By limiting car usage and creating infrastructure that supports walking and cycling, cities can inspire their residents to be more active, leading to improved health and well-being.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various cases from around the world. These include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity. By adopting similar strategies, such as car-free zones, driving bans, and car-free days, cities and individuals can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future. It is crucial for communities to prioritize alternative transportation options and create pedestrian-friendly environments to reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the importance of either keeping this system or changing it to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully reviewing the information from various sources, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College has practical benefits that should be acknowledged and supported.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide victory in terms of electoral votes. Although ties in the nationwide electoral vote are possible, they are highly unlikely. This system helps to avoid prolonged election disputes and provides a clear winner.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that every region in the United States has a say in the presidential election. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must appeal to a broad, diverse range of voters across different regions. It prevents candidates from focusing solely on high-population areas or strategically targeting specific demographics. This encourages candidates to develop policies and campaigns that consider the interests and perspectives of voters across the country, fostering a sense of inclusivity and guaranteeing that the president represents the entire nation.

The Electoral College also promotes the importance of swing states. While it is true that candidates tend to heavily campaign in swing states, this can actually be seen as beneficial. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, listen to the competing candidates, and make informed decisions. This increases voter engagement and encourages thoughtful voting. Additionally, it ensures that swing states, which can be more reflective of the ideological diversity of the country, have a significant impact on the election outcome, balancing out the influence of larger states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College effectively addresses the issue of representation for large states. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political balance by taking into account the population of each state. Larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as winning a close vote in a large state can result in a greater number of electoral votes. This prevents smaller states from being disproportionately overshadowed in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College provides a solution to the problem of runoff elections. If no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, it can be challenging to determine a clear winner and may lead to appeals for runoff elections. However, the Electoral College ensures that a single candidate wins the election by requiring them to secure a majority of the electoral votes. This avoids the complications and prolonged uncertainty of a runoff election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves a practical purpose and should be valued for the benefits it provides. It guarantees the certainty of outcome, ensures that every region has a voice, encourages voter engagement in swing states, balances out representation for larger states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. While there are legitimate arguments against the Electoral College, it is crucial to consider the practical implications and effects of any proposed changes. I urge you to carefully consider the advantages of the Electoral College system and make your decision accordingly.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will weigh all the insights provided and make a decision that best serves the interests of our country and its citizens. I look forward to hearing about your stance on this issue and any actions you plan to take.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping this system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several reasons based on the information presented in various sources.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College."" In this system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures a clear victor and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome. In contrast, a direct popular vote could more easily result in a close contest and potential controversies over vote counting and recounts, as demonstrated by the 2000 election.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president represents the entire nation, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Candidates must have broad regional appeal to win the required 270 electoral votes. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated areas or specific regions, allowing them to address the concerns and interests of all Americans. It promotes a balanced approach to governance and reduces the risk of regional disenfranchisement.

The Electoral College also brings attention to swing states, as stated by Judge Posner. In a system where electoral votes are awarded on a winner-take-all basis, candidates tend to focus their campaign efforts on states that are considered toss-ups. This leads to increased engagement and attention from voters in these states, promoting deeper analysis of candidates' policies and positions. Voters in swing states are more likely to play a pivotal role in deciding the election, fostering a democracy that values informed decision-making.

Moreover, the Electoral College helps maintain a balance of power between small and large states, as discussed by Judge Posner. The system ensures that large states do not overpower smaller states in presidential elections, preventing the dominance of heavily populated regions. By granting electoral votes based on population, the College provides small states with a greater influence than they would have in a purely popular vote system. This arrangement is consistent with the principles of federalism upon which our nation was founded.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, as pointed out by Judge Posner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the College invariably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional rounds of voting, which can be time-consuming and costly. The certainty provided by the Electoral College ensures a seamless transition of power and maintains stability in our democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has demonstrated numerous advantages that warrant its retention for choosing the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures that the president represents the entire nation, brings attention to swing states, balances the influence of small and large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While it is important to consider possible reforms, such as improvements to the winner-take-all system, the core principles of the Electoral College should be preserved to protect the integrity and effectiveness of our democracy.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will take these arguments into account as you deliberate on the future of the Electoral College.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the United States' presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the Electoral College offers several benefits that ensure a fair and balanced representation of the American people.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote while only obtaining 51.3% of the popular vote. This indicates that the Electoral College aligns the interests of the states and prevents a few densely populated areas from dominating the entire election process. With the current system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear result and avoiding disputes over the outcome.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate cannot rely solely on the support of one particular region and must consider the interests of the entire nation. This ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs and concerns of citizens from different regions, preventing a ""regional favorite"" from neglecting the interests of other parts of the country.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Swing states play a crucial role in election outcomes as they receive the most attention and information from candidates, resulting in more thoughtful and informed voters. This system ensures that candidates have a genuine interest in engaging with and addressing the concerns of swing state voters, ultimately improving the overall quality of the campaign.

The Electoral College also preserves the weight of larger states in the political balance. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. By considering both population and state size, the Electoral College balances the representation of both large and small states. This way, presidential candidates are incentivized to pay attention to the needs and concerns of both populous states like Florida and smaller states like Wyoming, ensuring a more equitable distribution of attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for complicated run-off elections. Under this system, a candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the clear winner, eliminating the need for further rounds of voting. This prevents political instability and ensures a smooth transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the numbers from the 2012 election indicate that eligible American voters are motivated to express their political preferences regardless of the impact on the national outcome. The Electoral College system has not hindered citizen participation in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several advantages that promote a fair and balanced presidential election. It ensures a clear outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, balances representation between large and small states, and avoids the complexity of run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system in our country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Limiting car usage can provide many advantages for both individuals and the environment. The passage set highlights several instances where car-free or car-reduced communities have been implemented and the positive outcomes that have resulted from these changes. One example is Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. As a result, the community has a higher quality of life, with less pollution, noise, and stress. Additionally, there has been a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, a major contributor to climate change.

Another example is the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people chose to hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. This event promotes alternative transportation methods and aims to reduce smog. Despite occasional rain showers, the turnout for the car-free day was large, showing that people are enthusiastic about the opportunity to lower air pollution and reduce stress.

The decrease in car usage in the United States is also highlighted in the passages. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, so reducing car usage can help combat climate change. Additionally, the decrease in driving can lead to less traffic congestion, resulting in shorter commute times and improved air quality for everyone.

There are multiple factors contributing to this change in behavior. The advancement of technology, such as the internet and smartphones, has made telecommuting and flexible commuting arrangements more feasible. The rise of shared transportation services, like bike-sharing and car-sharing programs, has also provided people with more options for getting around. Furthermore, the revitalization of urban centers has made suburbs less appealing, encouraging people to live in more walkable communities where they have easy access to amenities and public transportation.

Despite these positive outcomes, some concerns exist about the future of car culture and the impact of changing driving habits on the car industry. However, there is a growing recognition that personal vehicle ownership may not be practical or desirable in the long run. In response, some car companies are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies and envision a future where different modes of transportation are seamlessly connected to save time, resources, and improve safety.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate how car-free or car-reduced communities can lead to a higher quality of life, reduced pollution, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

While there may be concerns about the future of the car industry, it is clear that reducing car usage can bring about positive changes for everyone.",1
"  Rethinking Urban Life  The concept of car-free cities is gaining prominence as urban centers grapple with the complexities of rapid urbanization, environmental concerns, and the quest for sustainable living. Car-free cities envision urban spaces where private automobiles are either greatly restricted or entirely absent, making way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener urban landscape. This essay delves into the idea of car-free cities, shedding light on their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for successful implementation.  Car-free cities represent a paradigm shift in urban living that prioritizes sustainability, well-being, and community.  Environmental Sustainability: By significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities make a substantial contribution to curbing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, addressing the global challenge of climate change.  Public Health: Car-free cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and an overall enhancement of public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents.  Optimal Space Utilization: These cities transform urban spaces, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This urban rejuvenation improves the overall quality of life in these spaces.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is notably reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a more peaceful urban environment.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be an expensive endeavor. Relying less on private vehicles gives residents the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, contributing to their overall financial well-being.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly important issue as the negative impacts of cars on the environment and public health become more evident. This essay will explore the advantages of reducing car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in air quality, as well as the promotion of alternative transportation methods and the creation of more accessible and livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By reducing car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and combatting climate change. This is especially important considering the ambitious goals set by President Obama to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. By driving less and using alternative transportation methods, we can contribute to achieving these goals and creating a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on air quality. The smog and pollution caused by car emissions have become a major concern in many cities around the world. For example, Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution caused by car emissions (Duffer). By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for everyone. This is particularly important in densely populated areas where high levels of pollution can have detrimental effects on public health.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage also promotes the use of alternative transportation methods. Car-free communities, like Vauban in Germany, show that it is possible to live without cars and rely on public transportation and other alternatives (Rosenthal). By encouraging the use of bikes, buses, and trains, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. This not only benefits the environment but also provides a more sustainable and accessible way for people to commute and travel.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more accessible and livable communities. Traditional suburban areas have long been dependent on cars, with homes designed around the need for ample parking space and easy access to highways (Rosenthal). However, this car-centric design has led to sprawling developments and contributed to urban sprawl. By promoting the concept of smart planning, with compact communities and accessible public transportation, we can create more walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods. This promotes physical activity, reduces traffic congestion, and creates a sense of community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages both for individuals and society as a whole. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, we can contribute to tackling climate change and creating healthier environments. Additionally, promoting alternative transportation methods and creating more accessible communities can lead to better transportation systems and livable neighborhoods. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize and support the advantages of limiting car usage in order to create a more sustainable and equitable future.",1

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the benefits it provides in our presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in our elections. In a popular vote system, disputes over the election outcome are more likely to occur, as the winner may only have a slight plurality of votes. On the other hand, the Electoral College system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of disputes and provides a clear winner for the presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. With this system, presidential candidates are required to have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on winning one region. This encourages candidates to campaign in all states and address the concerns of diverse populations, rather than focusing solely on populous areas. It ensures that the president represents the interests of citizens from all regions, rather than just a few.

Moreover, the role of swing states in the Electoral College system encourages voter attentiveness and thoughtful decision-making. Toss-up states, in which the outcome is uncertain, receive much attention and resources from candidates. This results in voters in these states being more engaged and informed about the political campaigns, as they ultimately decide the election. By giving these voters a significant say in the outcome, we ensure that the most thoughtful and informed electorate decides who becomes president.

The Electoral College also provides balance and attention to all states, regardless of their size and population. Large states may lose some weight in the political balance due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, but the Electoral College restores some of this balance. Presidential candidates are incentivized to campaign in large states, ensuring that the concerns and issues of these states are addressed. This ensures that the interests of all states are considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This allows for a smooth and efficient transition of power, saving time and resources that would otherwise be utilized in further elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the data shows that voter turnout remains high in presidential elections. Voters participate in the process to express their political preferences and engage in the democratic system, rather than solely with the hopes of swinging a national election. Therefore, the Electoral College system does not hinder voter participation significantly.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our presidential elections and should be preserved. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes unity and representation for all regions, encourages thoughtful voter engagement, provides balance to all states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. These benefits make the Electoral College an important part of our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that upholds the principles of our democracy and best serves the interests of our great nation. I appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to hearing about your stance on the Electoral College.

Yours sincerely,

"Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment. For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will receive a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.",0
"In the text provided, it discusses the advantages of limiting car usage. The articles show, without car usage, there is a more safer environment. People are finding alternatives to getting around and not having to stress themselves about a car. Not using a car means people are able to help the environment physically and spiritually. Limiting car usage has a more positivity affect then using a car.

restricting the usage of cars means an advantage on a safer and healthier environment. When using a car it pollutes our air making the environment harsh. In the text it says ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This equation shows that reducing the use of cars can cause harsh conditions, such as smog, to reduce providing a safer environment for people and creatures living there. The text also says ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This evidence proving that with out the usage of cars the surroundings of a harsh city improved from things like uneven sidewalks, that could have caused people to walk on streets causing traffic or accidents, fixed to smooth sidewalks that people can use safely. The text also says ""If the pattern persists and many sociologist believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This evidence proves that limiting the usage of cars can lower the amount of emissions polluting the air we need to survive. Reducing the pollution in our air would conclude in safe, more efficient, and longlasting environment. Therefore, limiting the usage of cars have a more sufficent amount of advantages then not limiting the usage of cars.

Reducing the usage of cars also have advantages on people's wellbeing and happiness. Without the stress of sitting in a tiny box in todays new trafic jam, yelling at the car infont of you, behind you, or next to you, you could be out enjoying the fresh air not having to worry about being late because of an accident you weren't even in. The article says ""'Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" This evidence shows that without the use of cars people can be stress free, promoting a healthier environment with a smile. The text also states ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'"" This proving that with less usage from vehicles people are able to improve their living conditions by making minor adjustments. The advantages of limiting the usage of cars is more beneficial then not reducing the usage of vehicles.

Limiting car usage has more advantages and is beneficial to the safety of our environment. Without the reduction of car usage the environment and well being of living things on earth will continue to get worse. Without the limit of car usge, earth will continue to become a gaint ball of smog.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This shift is driven by concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and the desire to create more sustainable and livable communities. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage by examining examples from Germany, France, and Colombia.

Main Body:

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Additionally, in the United States, transportation is the second largest source of emissions, just behind power plants. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change.

Another benefit is the improvement of air quality. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, it is highlighted that diesel fuel, which is widely used in France, contributes to air pollution. Paris, a city known for its smog, implemented a partial driving ban to address this issue. The initiative resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion, highlighting the positive impact of limiting car usage on air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable and accessible communities. The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky discusses how a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This event, which has taken place for three consecutive years, has been successful in inspiring millions of Colombians to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. By prioritizing public transportation and non-motorized modes of transport, cities can become more livable, with reduced traffic congestion and improved accessibility for all residents.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it is noted that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, leading to decreased carbon emissions. While this may have negative implications for the car industry, there are opportunities for new modes of transportation, such as shared van services or bike-sharing programs, to thrive. These alternatives can create jobs and provide affordable transportation options.

Conclusion:

Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create sustainable communities, and stimulate economic growth. These benefits make it clear that transitioning away from car-dependent lifestyles is crucial for a more sustainable and livable future. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation modes, we can create a world where car usage is limited and our environment and communities flourish.",1
"The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the constitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters entrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential candidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potential voters.

The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.

This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their candidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.

This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..."" as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The candidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad,"" Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potential ruler of their country just because the candidates are focused on the states that will help them win.

Although ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee,"" as said by Richard A. Posner in In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.

The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the candidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country.",0
"Since the rise of suburbs nationally and globally, car culture has been an important component of our history and of the typical human experience. Every teenager anticipates the excitement and freedom of a driver's license, our country is ""the birthplace of the Model T"" and ""the home of Detroit,"" and mothers across the globe rely on SUVs and station wagons to haul their children to and from school, soccer practice, Sunday mass, and the like Source 4. In recent years, however, there is a growing trend of limited car usage around the world as countries promote vehiclefree neighborhoods and as in nations like the USA, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39year olds getting a license,"" Source 4. This trend, while seemingly alarming in our technologydependent universe, offers several advantages, from a better environment to healthier citizens and communities, and encouraging and promoting this pattern may just be as revolutionary for the planet as the introduction of the first car over a century ago.

From France to Colombia, first of all, governments have been encouraging limited car usage as a means to better the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions into our atmosphere after all, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States,"" source 1. As debates have run rampant around the world about global warming and air pollution, several nations have taken initiative and experimented with the effects of this idea. In the district of Vauban, Germany, for instance, ""street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden,"" and as a result of expensive parking spots for those who do choose to operate their vehicles upwards of 40,000 a pop ""70% of vaughn's families do not own cars,"" Source 1. Limited car usage and public transportation is alternatively being promoted in Germany and elsewhere as an attempt to live our daytoday lives in a way that is healthier for ourselves and the planet. France is one such example in Paris, for instance, ""one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" ""nearrecord pollution"" led officials to impose a driving ban to help clear the air, and almost 4,000 were ticketed with a 31 fine as a result of not following orders Source 2. Free public transit was offered, and a result of the actions of the ruling party, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog,"" Source 2. Likewise, Bogota, Colombia annually hosts a program known as the Day Without Cars that has attracted interest from neighboring countries and cities and provides an opportunity to ""take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo, who spent the day bicycling with his wife source 3. Globally, limiting car usage has resulted in exciting changes for not only the environment, but, surprisingly, public health as well.

The obesity crisis and lack of healthy social interactions, secondly, both are looming global issues due the rise of supersized fast food and innovations in social media and the Internet, and this trend of limited car usage serves as an unseen, advantageous remedy by promoting healthier people and communities. Without cars, people must find alternative forms of transportation, and in Bogota, for example, during the Day Without Cars, ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated...to work,"" and since this campaign began in the mid1990s, it has seen ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and has resulted in parks, sports centers, and broad sidewalks considerably less traffic and the emergence of ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts,"" Source 3. A mother of two in Vauban, Germany, Heidrun, Walter, claims that, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Source 1. Alternative forms of transportation also allow for increased social interaction walking with your neighbor on the way to work, your kids interacting while en route to school, or striking up a conversation with a stranger on a public bus or tram are all examples of making connections with others that do wonders for our mental and social health.",0
"In America, presidents are voted in by the electoral college. The electoral college is a process of electors from all the states that vote for the president and vice president. There are 538 electors, and you need 270 votes of that 538 to be elected. The electoral college is how we have been electing all of the presidents in America, but the president ought to be elected by a majority vote of the people, not by some fascist in a room voting for us.

Furthermore, the office of the federal register gladly explains the process of the electoral college and it has some holes. bradford Plumer explains in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even The best laid defenses are wrong"" says ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" He goes on and exemplifies the fact that the way the votes are cast and counted could be in fact more individually based. Maybe Mr. Plumer is wrong and the electoral college is the best thing for us, but, most people would agree that if we could all vote and have every individual vote counted, we would have a fair election and the true winner would be voted in.

Perhaps in ""Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, an electoral college would be good to have because of run off and big states and so forth. But plainly put, if we could just count voters as people of one nation, not individual states, we could have an efficient running election. For example: say there is 300 million people in America and the president needed 150,000,001 votes to win, then the majority rules factor can be initiated and there will be no run off, no problems with big states, no problem with swing states, and the certainty of outcome of everyone's president will be decided by majority.

Last but not least, all of the authors of the articles have great arguments and have concluded as so. ""what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" Bradford Plumer couldnt have summarized it better. If former presidents and other powerful organizations can can agree on abolishing the outdated electoral college then why cant we just get rid of it.

Finally, the electoral college is an old and untrustworthy system of lection currently used in the united states. perhaps if we could try the majority rules and have every legal voter counted as an individual, the election process would be more faithful. All in all, with time comes changes, and with chnges comes broad new spectrums of possibilities. But for the time being we should all be proactive in staying in motion with modernization, and every little change counts. Abolishing the electoral college is an innocent and small step in the right direction.",0
"Cars are used for transporting from place to place, but is it really the best way to get somewhere? There are many factors that are being affected when using cars. Many people believe cars are the best way to get somewhere but the only good thing about a car is the amount of time it takes to get somewhere. Even time isn't a good reason for why cars are being used. Limiting car usage would have so many advantages that people should take advantage of.

To begin with, some people use alternative transportation rather than cars. For example, Germany, Paris, and Columbia don't use cars on a daily basis like most people do in other countries. Those specific countries have either banned cars or they just don't need cars to transport from one place to another. Source 1 states, "" Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars."" In my neighborhood, most people walk to the public right near our community because they either don't have a car or they just prefer to walk. Although it might be quicker to go in car, it is environmentally friendly to ride your bike or walk. In Source 3 states, "" 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as her rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Taking a walk somewhere or riding a bike can be a great workout or just creates calmness if you are stressing. Alternative transportation are a good because then people wouldn't cause any harm to the environment or affect anything else.

In addition, smog is an issue that should be reduced which would limit car usage. Some places like Paris have already reduced smog so they could clear the air in their city. Source 2 states, "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" When the smog arose in Beijing, the amount of cars reduced which cleared the streets of France. Smog could be seen as a good thing because once it arouse, the amount of cars used decreased. Limiting car usage is a good thing, and people should realize that.

To conclude, there are so many advantages for limiting car usage. People have many other options instead of using cars and they should take advantage of that. Smog has created cars to be banned in many cities. Alternative transportaion makes many people not use cars and that is a good thing. Next time think about whether you want to use a car or just use something else.",0
"Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, and Audi. What do these car companies have in common? Less people are intrested in them, limiting car usage in certain places has lead to the popularity and need of owning a car decrease. Which so that there are advantages to limiting car usage such as less pollution and less traffic.

To begin, limiting car usage can lessen the amount of pollution in the air. Pollution is a topic used when hybrid cars are being talked and how they use less gas and pollute less but what about no pollution at all. How can we stop pollution? By no longer needing cars because ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 5. Fifty percent in the U.S. of greenhouse gas that is outrageous. As Americans we need to see that the greenhouse gases are causing all the global warming and animals becoming extinct because the environment around them is changing in ways they aren't used to. Limiting greenhouse gases is a must if pollution one day is going to stop. Also, limiting car use can benefit getting rid of the amount of useless gases in our atmosphere. As humans we need oxygen to live but in our atmosphere we currently have less then twenty percent of oxygen. We breathe in nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. In order to get rid of one or two of these gasses we need to limit the car use because limiting car use ""Will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Elizabeth Rosenthal paragraph 34. Cars make up so much of our gas emissions which is a huge reason to why the air is so mixed with many different gasses that our body just dosen't need, and so much smog and air pollution that is heating everything up and killing our planet that we currently inhabit. Unless we have colonies on Jupiter and Mars it seems like we are only killing ourselves.

To continue, limiting car usage can help lower the amount of traffic on the street. When diriving people always get mad when there is traffic or if they are caught in rush hour, why not just say getting to my job is a two minute drive I should just walk. Plus traffic can cause accidents wether it's someone in a hurry, or road rage, or just a complete accident, they happen. France at one point banned even number licence plate cars from driving on certain days and odd number licence plate cars on another to limit pollution, but one intresting stat from when they put the restrictions in place ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Robert Duffer paragraph 14. Traffic down sixty percent in such a large city which also has to help the tourist who don't have to wait so long for their taxi driver to get to the Eiffel Tower. Having traffic down such a huge percentage is an enourmous thing to have in a large area like that because an accident in that city can ruin a lot of people's days so limiting car usage can help in that situation. Also, every year in Cloumbia they have a day without cars to limit pollution and to encourage everyone to get out more and to walk and run around in the city of Bogota which is the city in which the day is held. Columbia limiting there use even if it's once a year is great where ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" Andrew Selsky paragrah 28. Limiting car use for one day a year even helps for one day of traffic where rush hours have very little traffic where the only people on the road are the people who don't want to follow the day with no cars. Having the little bit of traffic extremely helps tourist and people who have to use cabs to get around the city to go to work.

To conclude, major car companies like BMW and Jaguar need to watch out because not only is the popularity in cars not as high anymore, the need for them might be just as low because of countries stepping in and limiting car use to help lower the amount of pollution and traffic as they are helping to make the world a better place.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, I believe that the way our elections are run are not what is best for the United States. The Electoral College is changing the way that we originally set out to vote and is making things unfair for the citizens who vote. I propose that the Electoral College is taken away all together in order for elections to be more fair, and more like the original intention of the U.S. With most states following the winner takes all idea, the winner of the general public may not be the candidate that wins the elections. These times are rare, but they happened before there is nothing that is stopping them from happening again.

A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candidate will not vote for them. This process also seems to discriminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgotten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by bradford Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a electoral crisis based upon the Electoral College, because Al Gore received more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election.

Another reason that this process is so unstable is the way that it makes voters feel about voting. In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disappear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of their right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.

Some argue that a few votes can not do a lot and that the Electoral College is a far more organized way to conduct the voting. But every vote counts, and if every voter understood why they were voting for who they were voting for then the president may be a majority favorite. It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it?

I think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an Electoral College to the idea that all of the people in the United States are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right. bradfordd Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer. A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College.

There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon.",0
"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage for a Smarter Future

Introduction:
The issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, specifically from vehicles, has become a pressing concern for both developed and developing nations. As a result, initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, driving bans, and car-free days have been introduced to limit car usage. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on evidence from multiple sources, highlighting the benefits to the environment, public health, and quality of life.

Body Paragraphs:
1. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: 
Car emissions account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, a leading cause of climate change. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's New York Times article, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

2. Improved air quality and public health:
Driving bans, such as the one implemented in Paris due to smog, not only help combat pollution but also improve air quality. In Robert Duffer's article from the Chicago Tribune, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent after a five-day driving ban, bringing the city's air pollution levels down. This improvement in air quality leads to a decrease in respiratory problems and other health issues caused by pollution, benefiting the overall well-being of citizens.

3. Enhanced accessibility and livability:
Smart planning, as highlighted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, seeks to separate suburban life from excessive car usage. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, serves as an example of how limiting car usage can lead to a more accessible and livable neighborhood. With stores located within walking distance and public transportation easily accessible, residents can lead more sustainable lives without the need for personal vehicles. This concept is being adopted worldwide, creating compact and accessible suburbs that prioritize public transportation over cars.

4. Economical and efficient transportation:
By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, communities can reduce the burden on infrastructure. Instead of investing in extensive road networks and parking spaces, resources can be diverted to improve public transportation systems. Car-free communities can also promote efficient car-sharing programs, reducing the need for individuals to own cars and saving them money on maintenance and other associated costs.

5. Changing cultural norms:
As mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior not only contributes to reduced emissions but also indicates a cultural change in our perception of personal vehicles. Younger generations are less concerned about car ownership and prioritize alternative transportation options. This change in attitude presents an opportunity to reshape our cities and prioritize sustainable modes of transportation.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and far-reaching, benefiting the environment, public health, and the livability of communities. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transport, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance accessibility, and promote sustainable transportation practices. Implementing these changes now can help secure a smarter and more sustainable future for all.",1
"I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college because of the fact that if the popular vote and the vote in congress were to fail, there would be a backup way of casting, counting and recording votes by a qualified group of citizens, as stated in the first paragraph of the prompt. I believe the Electoral College should not be abolished also, for the reason that each candidate for president has an amount of electors chosen, varying on the state laws in effect in the given state he or she is being elected from. Also, an advantage of the Electoral College is also that the winning presidential candidate is awarded all of the electors in most states, except Maine and Nebraska, stated in the seventh paragraph.

The College also identifies which electors will represent your state at the meeting of electors, as well as the presidential candidate. Just like almost anything, the Electoral College has flaws, such as electors can be any person not holding public office, and, depending on the state, whoever selects electors may vary. Plus, not everyone can control who their electors vote for, but the Electoral College has been in effect for over 200 years, established by the founding fathers themselves in the Constitution, so why not trust that they knew what they were doing? Besides, when each party selects a slate of electors, they put their trust, which, might I add, is rarely betrayed. But there is the problem that not all winners of electoral votes will not win the national vote such an instance happened in 2000, when Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. Even so, that was the first time since 1888, as said in paragraph 16.

There are a few practical reasons the Electoral College, even though it lacks a democratic pedigree, should be retained. Reason one is a certainty of outcome. An example is in the 2012 election, when Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral votes, while rodney recieved 51.3 percent of popular votes. A tie, is also possible, seeing as the total number of votes, 538, is even. Another example is how the electoral college restores some of the weight in political balance, in which large states, populationwise, lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The subject of the Electoral Coolege's method of selecting a president is controversial in the sense that it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, such as Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California,when they know their vote will have no effect, their incentive is much less than if it were picked by popular vote.",0
"Why drive when you can use many other alternatives ! There are many reasons why the citizens in my town and all across the world should limit car use. Three really good reasons are, to limit pollution, to lower stress, healthier life style.

My first reason for thinking that we should limit are car usage because it is a very big cause of pollution. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal she states ""Passenger cars are responsible for up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Pollution is a very serious is that could easily be stop or reduced. Its also can be as simple as walking to your destination, car pooling, or even taking the bus. In the cities of Paris in France to help to reduce the smog and pollution they banned driving even numbered license plates from driving on one day and banned odd numbers on the next, Alternating every other day. Enough smog and pollution cleared one of the following days that the lifted the ban on odd numbered plates they were allowed to drive. These all always very easy ways to help stop pollution.

The second the reason why I thinking that we should limit our car use is if were to use them less it could lower our stress levels. The cities of Bogota, Colombia have day in which no one use a car for the whole day unless its public transportation or a taxis. One citizen claimed during car free day that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Another citizen who lives in a community where the streets are completly ""carfree"" says ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". If the citizens of the world were to cut down on the use of air polluting vehicles it could also not only less polluted place but also more calm and less stressed out people.

My final reason for agreeing with idea of limiting car usage is if we drive less we could all lead healthier lifestyles. Imagine how many calories you can burn by walking to corner store or taking a bike to your nearest walmart. The health benefits are endless. If you think about it sitting in the car barley moving to do anything you dont loose any calories at all. So why not walk, run, or jog instead.

In conclusion i think it would be best for all us to cut down the use of driving. My three reason are, to limit pollution, to lower stress, healthier life style. This would benefit not only us but to future generations of the world.",0
"To whom it may concern, The growing debate on whether or not the electoral college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electoral college is vital to the presidential election process because it evens out the importance of all the states votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for tossup states to vote for the best candidate.Posner It can be perceived that the electoral college is a nondemocratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people because the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electoral college has been around for decades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come?

The electoral college should be kept because it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electoral college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote because they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.Posner Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty.

Many of the time voters will vote because they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electoral college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate because they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.Posner With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the tossup staes chose them over the other.

A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electoral college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electoral college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections.

The electoral college is vital when chosing the presdient because it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electoral college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electoral college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electoral college is the best for the president's elections.",0
"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in november, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids runoff elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.

Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.

Runoff elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The runoff election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.",0

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College as the method of selecting the President of the United States. While there has been a growing call for a change to the system and the adoption of a popular vote, it is my belief that the Electoral College offers several advantages that ensure a fair and balanced outcome in the presidential election.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between choosing the President by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. Each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of members in its Congressional delegation. This system ensures that both small and large states have a voice in the election, preserving the principles of federalism and preventing tyranny of the majority.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. While a dispute over the outcome is possible, such occurrences are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system in most states, a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral vote victory. This certainty of outcome reduces the risk of prolonged election disputes and allows for a smooth and orderly transition of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes trans-regional appeal among presidential candidates. Without this system, candidates could focus solely on winning over particular regions and neglect the concerns and interests of other regions of the country. By requiring candidates to have broad support across various regions, the Electoral College ensures that the president has the best interests of all Americans at heart.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to focus campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the outcome is uncertain, receive increased attention from candidates. This results in a more informed and engaged electorate who carefully consider the candidates and their policies. Swing states represent a diverse range of interests and viewpoints, and their voters should have a say in determining the outcome of the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political weight of large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate based on state population means that large states have less influence than their population size would suggest. By allocating electoral votes based on representation in Congress, the Electoral College gives large states the attention they deserve from candidates, ensuring that their concerns are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, a run-off election would complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, preventing the need for further elections and providing stability and certainty to the American people.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is an integral part of our democratic process and should be retained. It ensures a fair representation of all states, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the political weight of large states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages contribute to a stable and fair presidential election system that upholds the principles of federalism and protects against the tyranny of the majority.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh the benefits of the Electoral College and make decisions that best serve the interests of the American people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many countries as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve quality of life. This essay will outline the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from the passages.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where reliance on cars is highest, it is possible to drastically reduce these emissions.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced due to extreme levels of pollution. The ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. Similar initiatives have been implemented in other cities, such as Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participated in a car-free day to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. The reduction in air pollution from cars can lead to a decrease in respiratory diseases and other health issues associated with poor air quality. Additionally, promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, can encourage people to be more physically active, leading to improved overall health and wellbeing.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is an example of a car-free community where streets are designed for pedestrians and bicycles, rather than cars. In these communities, stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for long car trips to malls or shopping centers. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a sense of community and encourages social interaction.

Finally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car-reduced"" communities, and legislators are considering measures to prioritize public transportation. These initiatives could lead to increased investment in public transit systems, creating job opportunities and stimulating economic growth. Additionally, individuals can save money by reducing car ownership and relying more on alternative forms of transportation, such as public transit or cycling.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement of air quality, promotion of public health, creation of more compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. As more countries and cities adopt measures to limit car usage, it is important for citizens to consider the benefits of alternative forms of transportation for a sustainable and healthier future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact our communities and the environment. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and the need for more infrastructure. Several examples from around the world highlight the benefits of limiting car usage.

One case study is Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. This experimental district is designed to be car-free, with strict regulations on street parking and driveways. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. Residents have experienced a decrease in stress levels and feel happier as they navigate the verdant streets, filled with bicycles and the laughter of children. This community demonstrates how limiting car usage can lead to a healthier and more enjoyable living environment.

Similar efforts to separate suburban life from auto use are being adopted in Europe, the United States, and beyond. In these new developments, stores are placed within walking distance rather than in distant malls, and public transportation plays a crucial role in connecting these communities to urban centers. For example, Transportation for America, a coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States, promotes the development of communities that are less dependent on cars. They emphasize the importance of reducing how much we drive, as it is just as significant as driving a hybrid car. These initiatives demonstrate a global shift towards smarter planning and a recognition of the need to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation.

Furthermore, cities are taking proactive measures to limit car usage during instances of extreme pollution. For instance, Paris enforced a partial driving ban after days of near-record pollution. Motorists with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or face fines. The ban resulted in a decrease in congestion by 60 percent and showcased the potential impact of limited car usage on reducing air pollution. Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, organizes an annual car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This event has successfully motivated millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or use buses, leaving the streets free of traffic congestion. These initiatives highlight the immediate positive effects of limiting car usage on air quality and congestion in cities.

The potential decline in car usage is also evident in trends observed in the United States. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. This shift in behavior could signal the end of car culture in America and has several implications. Firstly, it has the potential to reduce carbon emissions since transportation is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, it may lead to a rebranding of car companies, such as Ford and Mercedes, as mobility companies, indicating a broader range of transportation options beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for our communities and the environment. Examples from around the world demonstrate the positive impacts of car-free communities, smarter planning, and initiatives to reduce pollution. Additionally, trends observed in the United States indicate a potential decline in car usage, which could further contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions. It is imperative for us to prioritize alternative modes of transportation and invest in infrastructure that supports a car-free or reduced car lifestyle. By doing so, we can create healthier, more sustainable, and enjoyable environments for ourselves and future generations.",1
"The Electoral College is a process that should be around for plenty of years to come.

It was established by our founding father as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It's a simple process in which a running candidate would need a majority of 270 electoral votes.

Our founding fathers came up with this process in order for the election of a President to run smoothly. When using the Electoral College you have an exact percentage of the outcome of the votes, no guessing or estimating. The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. This is because voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met. Some may say that the winnertakeall system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning. Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them. Also no voter's vote swings a national election.

The electoral college has many ways that can help a candidate win the election and it might make things more easier for himher. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the malappotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution. Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about. But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a runoff election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for runoff elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner.

So all in all, the Electoral College should be kept and stay the way it is. It isn't complicated and makes the election run more smoothly. It provides multiple ways for a candidate to win the vote of a certain state and avoids major problem during the election.",0
"Cars have been part of our daily lives for decades and have become somewhat idolized in American culture. But cars are slowly killing our planet and are speeding up the Greenhouse effect taking place within our Earths atmosphere. We've become entirely too dependent on cars to get us where we wish to go, making many people lazy. Cars also emit gasses that can harm our internal body structures, causing problems with lung diseases and just the simple act of breathing. Many cities from all over the world have taken measures to limit the use of cars in daily life, making their homes cleaner and healthier to live in. More cities should start to do this as well to help save our planet and ourselves.

Environmentalists have hated cars for a long time because of the harmful effect it has to air we breathe. When nearrecord levels of smog filled the air of Paris, they enforced a temporary driving an in efforts to reduce the smog and within five days the smog cleared enough to allow citizens to start driving once again. In America, the number of drivers and car owners has been steadily reducing since 2005 and many experts believe it will continue to. A revolution could be started if enough people stop driving personal vehicles and instead walk, bike, or even just use public transportation.

People have adjusted over the years to things being given to them without them doing much to get it. Cars contribute to this and have caused laziness in many car owners. In Bogota, Columbia they have initiated and annual carfree day where everyone has to get to their jobs by means of biking or walking or taking public transportation. Carlos arturo Plaza rides his twoseat bicycle with his wife to work and both like the idea of limiting air pollution caused by cars. Pollution from cars can be dangerous for humans as well as the environment. By breathing in harsh gases we could acquire diseases such as COPD and lung cancer. Cars allow people to live unhealthy lifestyles in comfort while unknowing of the harm its causing. They are an insidious problem.

Cars have been gradually degenerating the planet and harming the people who use them. Thankfully many officials are working hard to limit this but we all have to contribute.",0
"Cars may have some advantages, but the world, would be a better place if we limited car usage. The benefits of limiting our usage of cars is, it will help improve the environment, there are healthy alternatives, and not using cars as much will decrease stress that people have.

Decreasing our car usage will improve the environment. In the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" In France they banned even numbered licence plates from driving, for one day, and one day was all it took for the high levels of smog to decrease. In another article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it talks about the decrease usage of cars through the years, paragraph 34 says "" If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" If the people keep slowing down on using cars, which scientist believe it will, there will be better carbon e,issions in the air, and the air will be better. Limiting car usage will help make our environment better.

Walking, biking, and skating are all exercises that help you stay fit, but they are also a healthy alternative to cars. A artical published in the Seattle Times called ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky describes the day that is trending all over the world, the day cars are banned. People in these countries, in this case Colombia ""hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work"" Banning car usage encourages people to get up and walk, run, or bike because they can't use their car. In the town Vauban, Germany a car free town, people walk everywhere, because the town has no cars. In the town ""...where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" The people in this town are walking and staying fit everyday.

One last benifit of limited car usage is it causes people less stress. Heidrun Walter , a mother of two who lives in Vauban, Germany, says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now."" Once Walter sold her car she was relived, she didn't have to worry about making her next car payment, when she would have to get gas again, or how much money gas was. Getting rid of her car relived her stress. Not using cars will decrease the amount of stress in society.

Over all, limiting are car usage would greatly benifit us, it will help keep the environment clean, keep our people healthy, and it will cause people less stress.",0

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as a compromise method established by the founding fathers in the Constitution, serves to maintain the integrity of the democratic process while also ensuring fair representation for all states. While there are arguments in favor of a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College remains the optimal method for electing the President, as it guarantees certain essential factors that a direct election would not.

One significant advantage of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. With the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of a disputed result or a close call, as a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could result in prolonged litigation and uncertainty, as seen in the 2000 presidential election crisis.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's President. Since no particular region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates must have broad trans-regional appeal. This requirement discourages candidates from solely focusing on favorable regions and enables them to represent the interests of all Americans. This prevents regional favoritism and helps maintain a cooperative balance among different regions of the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College system promotes fairness and empowers states of all sizes. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, ensuring that diverse perspectives and interests are taken into account by candidates. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated areas, deliberately neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By giving each state a voice in electing the President, the Electoral College addresses the malapportionment of the Senate and provides a more balanced representation of the country as a whole.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College inevitably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged electoral processes and ensures a more streamlined and efficient election.

While critics argue that a direct popular vote system would encourage voter participation, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are those who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe that their single vote will sway the election. In fact, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their state's outcome was predetermined. Therefore, the Electoral College does not impact voter turnout significantly.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a vital component of our democracy, providing certainty of outcome, fair representation for all states, and balance in the political process. It promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages candidates to address the concerns of all Americans, and ensures efficient and effective elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote system, the Electoral College stands as a solid method for electing our President.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I strongly urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College to protect the democratic principles upon which our country was founded.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and voter, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I will outline several reasons why the Electoral College has merit and should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. It is highly unlikely for a dispute to occur over the electoral vote, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system in most states, where even a small plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system reduces the likelihood of contentious disagreements over the outcome of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"" by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which discourages candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president will have a broader support base and is more likely to govern with consideration for the interests of all regions in the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This system compels politicians to pay attention to a diverse range of states and their issues instead of solely focusing on large population centers. Swing states receive increased campaign efforts and attention, allowing voters in those states to make informed decisions and have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. This focus on swing states also incentivizes thoughtful voting and engagement with the campaign by the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores a sense of balance for large states by providing them with more weight in the political process. While the Senate provides malapportionment of large states by population, the Electoral College allows presidential candidates to allocate resources and focus attention on densely populated states. This ensures that large states receive necessary attention from candidates during campaigns, regardless of the overall population disparities.

Lastly, the Electoral College effectively avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. Instead, this system produces a clear winner by requiring the majority of electoral votes, reducing the complications and expenses associated with conducting additional voting rounds for a clear winner to emerge.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, it is worth noting that the system has worked for over two centuries and safeguarded against potential election crises. The inefficiencies experienced in several instances are outweighed by the strength and stability the Electoral College provides to the democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure a certain outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, provide weight to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all compelling reasons to preserve this system. I respectfully urge you to take these factors into consideration when discussing any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust you will carefully weigh the arguments both for and against the Electoral College in your decision-making process. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to limit and reduce car usage. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on ideas and information from a set of passages.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to the fight against climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more compact and accessible suburbs. The example of Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, demonstrates how limiting car ownership can lead to the development of walkable streets and public transportation infrastructure. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents have access to a tram that takes them to downtown Freiburg. This model is being adopted in different parts of the world, with stores placed within walking distance and an emphasis on public transportation rather than distant highways.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improvements in air quality. The case of Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, shows how reducing car usage can help clear the air in congested cities. During the ban, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent, and the smog level dropped significantly. This improvement in air quality contributes to the health and wellbeing of the citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, attracted millions of participants, and other Colombian cities joined the event. The car-free day not only reduced traffic congestion but also provided an opportunity for people to experience alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, and taking public buses. This shift towards alternative transportation can save money for individuals and reduce the strain on public infrastructure.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to changes in cultural attitudes towards transportation. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This shift in behavior, if sustained, can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment. In addition, the rise of telecommuting, shared van services, and car-sharing programs shows that people are finding alternative ways to commute and travel without relying solely on personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has various advantages that contribute to a more sustainable and livable environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating compact and accessible suburbs, improving air quality, and promoting alternatives to personal vehicles, communities can move towards a more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and support initiatives that encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight several key benefits that can be achieved by reducing our reliance on cars.

Firstly, limiting car usage can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and passenger cars specifically contribute to a large portion of these emissions. For example, in Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this percentage can even reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help to alleviate smog and improve air quality in cities. The passages provide examples of cities like Paris and Bogota, where driving bans or car-free days were implemented to reduce smog levels. These measures resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and improved air quality. This not only benefits human health by reducing the risks of respiratory problems and other illnesses associated with pollution but also creates a more pleasant and livable urban environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation systems. The passages mention the concept of ""smart planning,"" which involves designing communities that are less dependent on cars. This approach focuses on creating compact, walkable neighborhoods with access to public transportation and amenities within a short distance. By adopting this model, cities can reduce the need for excessive parking spaces and sprawling highways, making more efficient use of land and resources.

Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The passages highlight how car-free communities like Vauban in Germany have experienced positive outcomes, including improved quality of life. The money typically spent on car ownership and maintenance can be redirected towards other needs and desires. Additionally, promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, and public transit, can boost local economies by encouraging more people to use local businesses and services.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant and wide-ranging. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality, creating more sustainable transportation systems, and providing economic benefits, the case for decreasing our reliance on cars is compelling. By implementing measures like car-free days, creating car-reduced communities, and embracing alternative modes of transportation, we can work towards a greener, healthier, and more prosperous future.",1
"Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I'll narrow it down to two for you People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.

First, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choose by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the state legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy the president at the time he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It's happen before, so who's to say that it won't happen again.

Second, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidential election off of popular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like rodney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the ""Terminator"" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.",0
"Travel, exploration, and new destinations are all things that have lead to mankind creating new ways to get from where they were to where they wanted to be. We have made some fantastic technologies in our desire to move more quickly and extensively. Not many could have dreamt of a day when mankind could ship large cargo from Mexico to Greece, fly large planes full of people across the atlantic, or even what seems so common today, drive in comfort from state to state in short amounts of time. We enjoy the ability to drive so easily from place to place that almost every single American family owns at least one car, but there in lies a problem.

since the big boom of industrial car manufacturing in the early twentieth century America's use of the vehicle has spread from transportation of the high class, to a tool of public transportation, construction, delivery, and overall everyday use. This relationship between man and machine has been a part of our society for so long it is practically a part of our lives, but this relationship has taken a toll on the world it was brought into in the form of pollution. The basic way an automobile functions is by putting fuel into the system to run the engine and then emmiting that fuel as a gas byproduct, and with such the wide spread use we have of these machines, the amount of gas byproduct has really built up. Harmful chemicals in these gas emissions from our automobiles have provided the second largest source of our emissions with only power plants contributing more to the pollution of the environment.

There are however some easy ways we could help fix this problem. In other parts of the world this effect is being felt, such as Beijing, China, which is facing a huge problem with pollution smog, and certian places have decided to make a change by limiting car use. This limitation of car use can be done in many different ways, and has helped curb a smog problem that arose in Paris. Other places have done this by means of carfree neighborhoods in Germany, or a carfree day in Columbia, and the reaction has been most positive.

These ideas of change for a clean future are helping communities in different parts of the world, so whose to say we can't do it too? We should contribute to the healing of our environment before its too late for the choise. This oppurtunity for change is not one we should let slip by, and it could be a refreshing, enjoyable change. Lets not sit down and watch as our environment becomes a smogridden disaster, lets get up, walk around, and help heal the world.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves important functions and benefits the democratic process in several ways.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of the outcome. As outlined in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system significantly reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the potential for a nationwide electoral vote tie is highly unlikely. The Electoral College provides a clear winner with an indisputable majority.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is representative of the entire country, rather than just a specific region. As stated in Posner's article, a presidential candidate must have trans-regional appeal to garner enough electoral votes for victory. This prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from becoming president, which could result in other regions feeling disenfranchised and disconnected from their leader. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across different regions and take into account the interests of the entire country.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This helps to ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of these states and their voters. As mentioned in Posner's article, voters in swing states are more likely to be informed and engaged, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the election outcome. This could lead to more thoughtful and informed decision-making by voters.

Fourthly, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political representation of large and small states. Posner argues that the Electoral College compensates for the inequality in the Senate by giving more weight to large states in the presidential election. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on populous states while neglecting the interests of smaller states. It promotes a more equitable distribution of attention and resources during the campaign process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity and costs associated with run-off elections, as outlined by Posner. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even if the popular vote results in a plurality instead of a majority for a candidate.

While opponents argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in states dominated by one party, it is important to note that voter participation is driven by the desire to express political preferences rather than the belief in a single vote having the potential to decide an election, as mentioned in Posner's article.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses campaigns on swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. It is a fundamental process that protects the democratic values upheld by our founding fathers. I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College when making decisions related to this important aspect of our democratic system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This approach, known as ""smart planning,"" is being increasingly adopted around the world. By reducing reliance on cars, communities are able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible suburbs, and promote alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or biking, communities can help reduce the harmful effects of these emissions on the environment and public health.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage also has social and economic advantages. For example, by creating more compact suburbs with less space for parking, communities can encourage people to live closer to their workplaces. This reduces the need for long commutes and helps alleviate traffic congestion. Additionally, by promoting public transportation and making it more accessible, communities can provide an affordable and efficient means of travel for residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can contribute to the revitalization of city centers and local economies. By placing stores and amenities within walking distance, communities can create vibrant main streets and reduce the need for extensive mall developments. This not only benefits local businesses, but also promotes a sense of community and social interaction.

It is important to note that limiting car usage does not mean eliminating cars altogether. Car ownership is still allowed, but parking options are restricted. This approach has been successfully implemented in places like Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited to large garages at the edge of the community. This encourages residents to consider alternative transportation options and reduces the overall number of cars on the streets.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and promote alternative forms of transportation. By adopting smart planning strategies and creating more compact and accessible communities, we can create a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat pollution. This movement is gaining traction in cities and suburbs around the world, as people recognize the numerous advantages of reducing dependence on cars.

One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and take important steps towards mitigating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. Cars emit harmful pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have detrimental effects on human health. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for individuals to live in.

Limiting car usage also has positive impacts on urban planning and infrastructure. Many suburbs and cities are built around the idea of car dependence, with sprawling neighborhoods and extensive road networks. This type of development is not sustainable in the long term, as it requires a significant amount of land and resources. By limiting car usage, we can encourage more compact and accessible communities, where stores and amenities are within walking or biking distance. This type of development is better for the environment, as it reduces the need for cars and promotes active transportation.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. Cars are expensive to own and maintain, and they require a significant amount of resources, such as fossil fuels, for operation. By reducing car usage, individuals can save money on transportation costs and allocate those resources to other areas of their lives. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of new job opportunities in industries related to public transportation and active transportation infrastructure.

Overall, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote more sustainable urban planning, and provide economic benefits. As the movement to limit car usage continues to grow, it is important for individuals, communities, and governments to recognize and embrace the advantages of reducing car dependence. By doing so, we can create healthier, more sustainable, and more livable communities for future generations.",1

Subject: The Benefits of Keeping the Electoral College
 
Dear [Senator’s Name],
 
I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves important purposes and should be preserved. In this letter, I will present arguments in favor of the Electoral College system, drawing evidence from various sources.
 
One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that disputes over electoral votes are less likely to occur than disputes over the popular vote. He states that because the winner-take-all system is used in most states, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide victory in the electoral vote for that state (Posner, 2012). This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the national popular vote, reducing the likelihood of contested election results.
 
Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of a president who represents the entire nation. As Judge Posner suggests, a presidential candidate must have broad trans-regional appeal to win the electoral vote. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from being elected and ensures that the president will be accountable to the interests of people from all regions of the country (Posner, 2012).
 
Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across different states, including swing states. Bradford Plumer points out that candidates tend to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain (Plumer, 2008). This means that voters in swing states receive more attention from candidates and may be more informed and thoughtful in their voting decisions. In turn, this ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are well-informed about the candidates and their policies, have a greater influence in deciding the election.
 
Moreover, the Electoral College system balances the weight of large states against smaller states, addressing the potential imbalance created by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates because winning by a similar margin in a large state yields more electoral votes than in a small state (Posner, 2012). This allows candidates to address the concerns and interests of both large and small states, preventing an imbalance in representation.
 
Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can complicate the election process. Posner (2012) highlights that the Electoral College method selects a clear winner, even if the popular vote results in a plurality. This ensures a more straightforward and conclusive outcome, reducing the uncertainty and potential for prolonged election disputes.
 
In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important functions that benefit the nation as a whole. It provides certainty in election outcomes, ensures that the president represents the entire country, encourages candidates to campaign in diverse states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of our democratic system. I strongly recommend preserving the Electoral College to maintain its numerous benefits.
 
Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I hope that you will take these arguments into account as you make decisions regarding the future of our presidential election system.

"The Automobile Industry has done nothing but grow since World War II. The Car has begun to implement itself into our culture, becoming a part of sporting events, TV shows, and even video games. Recently, however, the automobile industry has been experiencing a shift in interest. Countries around the world are implementing ""Car Free Days,"" or even carfree cities into their laws and cultures. The new laws and ideas are seen by some as irrelevant, or pointless, and some have even resisted these laws. While car lovers and enthusiasts may not enjoy the laws very much, when implemented on their daily lives, studies have shown that the new ideas are extremely important, maybe even revolutionary.

The car free environment begins in the German suburbia, where residents of a large community called Vauban live their daily lives CarFree. Vauban is free of street parking and driveways, and full of cyclists, skateboarders, roller blades, and any other emmision free means of transportation you can imagine. Because of this, nearly 3 out of 4 families in Vauban do not own cars. ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, mother of 2 and resident of Vauban, Germany, mentioned in source 1. Car owners in Vauban park the vehicles in garages at the edge of town, to make commutes to nearby developments. Car free cities like Vauban are believed to be the next step to a greener, better world.

More efforts like Vauban are being made in large cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia. According to source 2, Paris recently enforced a law to reduce emmisions, where even number plated cars may drive on Monday, and odd number plated cars my drive on Tuesday, and so on. The laws soon proved ineffective after a short time, for Paris to recind them. Paris, being one of the most polluted European cities, will certainly be making more efforts against pollution. An improvement campaign in Bogota, Columbia calls for one whole day without cars, according to source 3. Citizens are urged to take other means of transportation, like bikes or busses. Violators faced a 25 fine. The dark gray rainclouds didn't stop the citizens of Bogota from taking away stress and air pollution. This year, for the first time, two other cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined Bogota in the event. Cities around the world like Paris and Bogota are making efforts to reduce air pollution and leading better lives in cleaner cities.

Driving in America hit it's peak in 2005, when the number of miles driven in relationship to population was largest, according to source 4. Since then, the stats have dropped steadily, now sitting 9% below what it was in 1995. Many sociologists believe that the biggest decrease in milage is shown in young people between 16 and 39. Studies show that driving by these people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. Many experts now believe that America's car culture has hit its peak, and is now on the decline.

There are many advantages of limiting car usage. The people of Bogota, Vauban, and Paris know that in most cases, cars cause stress, and that even a day without it can refresh your mind. The citizens of Vauban, who do not use cars in their daily lives, are living comfortably, and happily, without producing carbon emmisions into the environment. Even Americans are jumping on the band wagon, where young people are now using cars only when public transport is unavailable. Cars make moving easy, there is no doubt in that. But can the emmisions of the vehicles be avoided, without sacrificing the quality of our daily life? According to Vauban, Bogota, and Paris, it can be done, and it will be done.",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to advocate against changing to a system of election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, plays a crucial role in our democratic process.

One of the main benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As mentioned in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is significantly lower compared to a dispute over the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This creates a clear and decisive outcome in the election.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that the president has trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are encouraged to campaign across the country and consider the interests of various regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that all Americans feel represented by the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system enhances the importance of swing states. In a close election, candidates focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This encourages voters in those states to pay close attention to the campaign and be more thoughtful in their decision-making. These swing states become the battlegrounds where the election is truly decided, allowing for a more engaged electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives small states more power, and the Electoral College offsets this by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of highly populated areas and consider the needs of all states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections. By invariably producing a clear winner, it eliminates the need for further rounds of voting when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This streamlines the election process and allows for a smooth transition of power.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe their single vote may decide the outcome. In spite of this, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the last presidential election, indicating that voters are still motivated to participate.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system, providing certainty of outcome, ensuring trans-regional appeal, giving importance to swing states, balancing the influence of large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. While arguments can be made for changing to a popular vote system, the benefits and practicality of the Electoral College outweigh them. It is crucial that we keep the Electoral College and preserve the integrity of our democratic process.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many have called for its abolition in favor of a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College has several important benefits that need to be taken into consideration.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President through a popular vote of qualified citizens. This compromise preserved a balance between the power of the states and the power of the people. It consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation, ensuring that every state has a say in the presidential election.

One argument in favor of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. In most states, the winner-take-all system awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. This system creates a decisive result, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the popular vote. Moreover, the winner of the electoral vote typically aligns with the winner of the popular vote. While there have been exceptions, such as the 2000 election, these occurrences are rare.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This requirement forces candidates to campaign across diverse regions and address the concerns of a wide range of voters. It prevents candidates with only regional appeal from winning the presidency, ensuring that the President represents the interests of the entire nation.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. Because the winner-take-all method is used in most states, candidates focus on the states where the outcome is more uncertain. This means that voters in these swing states receive more attention and have a greater influence over the election. It leads to a more engaged electorate and encourages thoughtful voting.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores political balance between different states. Large states, by virtue of their population, would have an outsized influence in a purely popular vote system. The Electoral College balances this out by providing smaller states with a greater voice. This prevents candidates from ignoring smaller states and ensures that they pay attention to the concerns of all Americans.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College allows for a decisive winner. This avoids the complications and uncertainty of run-off elections and provides a clear outcome.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College serves a vital purpose in our democratic system. It provides a balance between the power of the states and the power of the people, and it ensures that the President represents the interests of the entire nation. While some argue for its abolition, the benefits of the Electoral College should not be overlooked. I urge you to consider these factors when discussing any potential changes to the election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have long been a symbol of suburban life. However, limiting car usage in favor of alternative transportation methods can have numerous advantages. The passage set provides several examples of these advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation. By examining these benefits, it becomes clear that limiting car usage can lead to a more sustainable and healthier environment.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in the United States, the figure can be as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, biking, and public transportation, these emissions can be significantly reduced. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the preservation of our planet.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The passage on Paris's ban on driving due to smog highlights the detrimental effects of car emissions on air quality. The article states that Paris experienced near-record pollution, which rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By limiting car usage, particularly in highly populated areas, the concentration of harmful pollutants in the air can be reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier environments for citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to increased accessibility to public transportation. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that the community is car-free, with only limited parking spaces available at the edge of the development. As a result, a significant percentage of Vauban's residents do not own cars, and the community is more accessible to public transportation. By adopting this approach in other suburbs, more people will have access to efficient and sustainable modes of transportation. This can reduce congestion on the roads and provide viable alternatives to driving.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and increasing accessibility to public transportation, communities can work towards a greener and more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and promote alternative transportation methods as a means to achieve these advantages.",1
"Ever wondered how the streets of a very populated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole ""carfree"" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.

In Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go carfree. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" Source 1. 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly carfree except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beautiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" source 1. Miami is a carintensive area, I know this from personal experience, there is always traffic during the day. I've been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it's something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn't stars, it's how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.

Paris, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn't run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31"" Source 2. Even though some didn't listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" Source 2. Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we'll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this carfree thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.

""BOGOTA, Colombia In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3. Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one carfree day, in Bogota called ""Day Without Cars"", this was the third year actually, on this ""carfree"" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Source 3. If you've ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.

In the United States, research shows ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" Source 4. This meaning that adolescents aren't as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren't even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can't make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can't pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" Source 4. This means that people aren't as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we'll see more stars in the sky in carintensive areas.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for individuals and communities. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. In Europe, for example, passenger cars account for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas of the United States, the number can go up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can make a significant impact in reducing these emissions and mitigating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris and Bogota, where strict driving bans have been implemented during periods of heavy smog, significant reductions in pollution and congestion have been observed. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease air pollution and create healthier environments for everyone.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on public health. Encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or taking public transit, can lead to increased physical activity. Regular physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. By creating car-free communities and promoting active transportation, we can improve the overall health and well-being of individuals.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and livable communities. In car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, residents have reported increased happiness and reduced stress levels. Without cars, streets become safer and more enjoyable for pedestrians and cyclists. Additionally, having stores and amenities within walking distance reduces the need for long car trips, making communities more compact and accessible.

Finally, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. When fewer people drive, there is less need for extensive road infrastructure and parking spaces. This can free up valuable land for other purposes, such as housing or green spaces. Additionally, reducing car dependency can save individuals and families money on fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for individuals and communities. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting public health and creating sustainable communities, the benefits are clear. It is crucial for us to embrace alternative modes of transportation and move towards car-free or low-car communities. By doing so, we can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be considered.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputed election results, as seen in the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The Electoral College provides a clear and decisive path to victory, which is crucial for maintaining a stable democracy.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes representation for all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have the most support, ensuring that the president will have broad-based support and take into account the interests of all Americans. It also prevents candidates from ignoring states with smaller populations, as the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes gives even small states some weight in the election.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome of the election is less certain. This means that voters in these states, who are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, have a greater influence on the outcome of the election. It encourages candidates to engage with voters directly and tailor their policies to address the concerns of these swing states. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have a say in deciding the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may give smaller states more influence, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates. This means that candidates must consider the concerns and interests of both large and small states, maintaining a balance of power and preventing one group from dominating the decision-making process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections. When no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections may be necessary. The Electoral College reduces the likelihood of this scenario by invariably producing a clear winner. This streamlines the election process and allows for a smooth transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages campaigning in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College remains the best method for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this issue. I trust that you will take into account the diverse viewpoints and interests of your constituents when making decisions that affect our democracy.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The Electoral College should be not be abolished and the government should not change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. The Electoral College requires the presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal, it produces a clear winner and avoids runoff elections, and the Electoral College allows people in swing states to be more thoughtful and choose wisely because the popular vote could be in their hands.

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , it states, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This means that the favorite candidate of a particular region has no reason to campaign too much in those states because that candidate doesn't gain many more votes. Any candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful because the people of the other region feel that their interests will be overlooked by the president.

The Electoral College decreases the amount of pressure of a runoff election. In paragraph twentytwo of the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" So if both presidential candidates receive an equal percent of of popular votes, the Electoral College's number of votes could be the ""game changer."" The number of votes in the Electoral College produces a clear winner. If there wasn't an Electoral College, then there would have to be a recount of votes and one vote could change the entire election. This could cause chaos in swing states because of the one vote of someone that might not even care who wins the election.

Based on many elections, the Electoral College creates more thoughtful voters in swing states. Those people know that the power of turning an election around is in their hands, so they must use that knowledge wisely, not recklessly. People in nonswing states will vote on a candidate that their peers like or that they heard is ""the best"" even though it may actually be a choice reconsidered two years into the winning candidates presidency. In paragraph twenty of the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , it states, ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competeing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election."" The most careful voters should be the ones to decide because they are the ones receiving the most attention by candidates trying to persuade them to vote for them.

Overall, the Electoral College should not be abolished and the government should not change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. The Electoral College doesn't allow a presidential candidate to have a single regional appeal, it produces a clear and fair winner and avoids runoff elections, and the Electoral College creates more thoughtful and careful voters, because when you actually think choices through in life, it could make a tremendous impact on yourself everyone around you.",0
"Votes for the president of the United States are counted each election in two ways, the popular vote and the Electoral College. The popular vote is the people's vote, which allows our democratic nation to vote for their leader themselves, and the Electoral College is dependent upon the popular vote, and casts electoral votes based on the number of Representatives and Senators each state has in Congress Source One. People have consistently debated over whether or not this was a fair election process, due to the fact that the people's votes do not directly go to the president. Because of this, many people want the Electoral College to be gone, and people have attempted to abolish it in the past. The Electoral College should be abolished and the US should adopt the popular vote system as their only system because we live in a democratic nation, the current electoral voting process may not represent the popular vote, and it's a more fair system.

As citizens of the United States of America, we depend on the fact that we live in a free nation that values our justice, liberty, and voice. Included within our voice, we also depend on our democracy, that allows us to have say in who runs our country and how. It's important that we take advantage of this voice we have in the government, and it's also important we are represented fairly within it. When we depend on electors from the Electoral College to vote for who our states popular votes went to, they may not be doing that. They ultimately can decide who they are voting for, and if they decide to vote for the opponent, no one can stop them. It's very easy for them to betray our trust without our awareness Source Two. Source Three also states that ""that trust is rarely betrayed,"" which makes it clear that although uncommon, there have been incidents in the past where the citizens have been represented unfairly. In a democratic nation, we should have true sovereignty and be able to cast our popular vote, and know that it is being counted and included in the final say of our leader.

Overall, the Electoral Vote may not represent the Popular vote. As mentioned, there have been incidents in the past that have indicated the truthfulness of this statement. For example, in 1960 John F. Kennedy was almost opposed by unfair elections due to our country's people being misrepresented Source Two. Even if the popular vote of our state goes one way, the ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Source Two. The electors are unreliable and may go one way just because they please to do so while leaving the faithful citizens in the dust with their decisions and votes meaning nothing. The popular vote system would better represent the people than the unreliable Electoral College system we have now.

The popular vote system is a more fair system, one of many reasons being that it would eliminate the advantage large and ""swing"" states have over others. Currently, ""swing"" states are being given more attention to be the candidates because the candidates realize that the fate of their presidency may be dependent upon these states Sources Two and Three. Since the Swing states are the ones who's votes can go either way, the candidates spend more time with these states in order to insure their likelihood to achieve the states electoral votes. This is not a fair process because the other states are not getting to know the candidates like these states do. The same thing goes for large states. Since the number of electoral votes you have is dependent upon population, the larger states have more electorsrepresentatives. Therefore, the presidential candidates want to achieve as many electoral votes as possible and will make sure to appeal to the larger states, leaving the smaller states at a disadvantage due to misrepresentation. The popular vote system would take everyone into account evenly, and therefore represent everyone fairly, and make for a better voting system.

All in all, the current Electoral College system is unfair, misrepresented, and unappealing to a democratic nation. The system should be abolished for all of these reasons, and allow the popular voting system to come in to play. The popular vote system would allow each citizen to be represented equally, and create a more level and fair environment. It's important that a democratic nation feels like one, and that we are all represented fairly, and there's no better way to do so than by being our own representatives.",0
"The invention of the automobile revolutionized the way humans traveled from place to place in the 20th century, but now since we have entered the last century, people are beginning to question why we implement the automobile so much into our lives. The automobile should not be so interconnected within our lives, in fact, limiting it's usage would have many advantages. These advantages include cutting down on our carbon footprint, and reducing the amount of stress and congestion within our streets.

Restricting the usage of the automobile can benefit the environment immensely. After all, transportation is the second largest source of pollution in the US, so restricting automobiles can severely reduce the impact of carbon emissions on our environment Rosenthal. If we don't take action now, and start cracking down on pollution from carbon emissions, our cities will develop smog problems similar to what Beijing experiences, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world Duffer. fortunately for Paris, a week of partial driving bans helped clear the five days of nearrecord pollution it was experiencing, and it helped it return to normal Duffer. If five days of reducing the number of drivers by half manages to clear the smog from Paris, it's possible to delay or even halt the risng of global warming across the planet if the globe decides to enact restrictions on car usage. Therefore, restricting car usage could have innumerable benefits for our environment.

Another advantage of restricting car usage would be a reduction in the amount of stress and congestion crowding our city streets. For instance, when Paris enacted the weeklong half ban on automobile usage, congestion was down 60% in the city's streets Duffer. Another instance of a city banning automobiles is Bogota, Columbia, which bans cars one day a year. The goal is intended to promote alternative transportation in the city, and this leaves the ""streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic Jams"" Selsky. Many citizens enjoy this day, and resident Carlos Arturo Plaza described the day as ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" selsky. A city called Vauban in Germany are pioneering a new type community where no cars are permitted within the city, and the only area they are permitted are the outskirts of the city. This orientation benefits the residents by elimating most of the noise and stress of car engines running, and instead replacing them with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children Rosenthal. A resident of the pioneer city, Heidrun Walter, said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal. Therefore, limiting car usage collosally reduces the pandomonium and congestion we experience everyday in our lives due to automobiles.

All in all, restricting car usage poses numerous advantages for everyone. The advantages include reducing our impact on the environment by cutting down carbon emissions, as well as decreasing the amount of stress and congestion found in our city streets.",0
"Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors.

To begin, when we look at studies we find that when people use their cars immensely, there is a harmful effect in our atmosphere, also referred to as The Greenhouse Effect. France has been a major component to this harmful gas, as explained by Robert Duffer in the passage ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."" In addition, Duffer continues to provide evidence to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"" By including this simple sentence, we are fully aware of just how much harm pollution has done to the environment due to car usage in Paris. Moreover, the smog in Paris was so intense that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Although almost 4,000 drivers were fined, the smog had cleared enough by Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. This movement is also spreading to places such as Bogota, Colombia where they have a day free of cars with the exception of taxis and buses for example, in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza explains ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" Many ideas are being formed to show that people care about what their harmful ways have done and are looking to find solutions to minimize the pollution and undo what wrong has been done.

Buying cars over the years has become quite an expense to everyone and has become somewhat burdenlike. By limiting and even canceling out the use of cars people have cut down expenses greatly. Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accommodate those who have made this decision by making public transit ""free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" according to the BBC in the article Paris bans driving due to smog. As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently. Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article The End of Car Culture when she includes ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when ""Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work."" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.

Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen.",0
"Since the 1950's everyone's dream was to have a nice car but it is coming to a point in time where the car culture is coming to an end. You might be thinking that this is horrible and how will i get places without a car. No, it's not horrible at all, it's actually very beneficial in other ways. It can help people become free,less dependent,and it reduces the amount of greenhouse gases tremendously.

The first reason that limiting car use is a good thing is because it can help people become free and less dependent. It has caused people to not always be in a hurry and made them less stressed. In Bogota, Colombia they had a carfree day where people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. People felt so free and they felt they were doing a good deed so some got rid of their cars for good. Cars are becoming less popular in the world as we speak. For example from 2005 to 2013 the number of miles driven in the U.S.has reduced by 9%, which is equal to where the country was in 1995. Another example is that a study last year found that driving by young people decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Also shopping centers are moving to places where they can be walked to rather than on a way off highway somewhere.""What intrigues me is that rates ofcar ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" says Micheal siva who studies this trend at the University of Michigan.

The next reason is that increasing the use of cars will help the environment greatly. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S. All of our development since World War 2 has been centered around cars and it hasn't helped the environment any. For example, in Paris they were going to have two no car days to reduce the smog. The first day they said that no one with and even numbered license plate were allowed to drive and odd would be the next. After the first day was over the smog was reduced by so much that they didn't even have to use the next day. This is just a small number of people. Imagine if everyone would participate even just for small periods of time.

In conclusion, now that you have learned that life without out cars can make you feel free, less dependent, and have the environment. Have you changed your opinion? ""giving up cars is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twosear bicycle with his wife.",0
"Cars, they are used for many purposes including taking the kids to school, going to work and many others but have you ever thought about what vehicle are doing to the Earth or the people on the Earth? Well cars have to use gasoline or diesel to move that is just how it always has been but these fossil fuels are actually poluting the Earth, and making the air we breath very ""smoggy."" If we can limit our usage of our cars there can be many advantages including having cleaner air to breath, more excercize, and also less expenses. Humans could survive without cars if we give it a shot.

Take a deep breath outside, what do you smell? Listen, what do you hear? Cars honking? A loud engine of a diesel truck? Well most likely because cars have been around for a long time and without them how would people get to work or school, but have you ever thought about what these cars and trucks are letting out of their tailpipe? Source 1 ""In German Suburb,Life goes on with cars"" says that there has been ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe"" these greenhouse gases are clogging up our atmosphere and our air. Without cars air pollution would go down emensly, and would be a big advantage. In Paris there has been ""nearrecord pollution"" ""Paris bans driving to to smog"" By: Robert Duffer.

Now a days when people hear excessive they would run and hide but it's mostly because we have all these vehicle that can take us places without the dreaded walking or running. Americans today can get a cheeseburger in minutes through a drivethru in their vehicle but have you ever imagined life without a car, in Columbia on "" The Day without Cars"" as said in "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota By: Andrew Salsky ""Columbians hiked, biked, skated...to work during a car free day"" and even ""parks and sports centers also have smooth sidewalks"" which has ""dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants...have cropped up"" The car free day has made excessive a little easier, and now with smoother side walks and more sports centers people in Columbia can have more opportunities to take a walk.

When you have a car its not unusual to have to go get gas atleast once every one or two weeks, but these expenses can pile up when you have to buy gas or even the oil change of your vehical. What if you get in a accident will your insurence cover it, cars and trucks take a lot of expenses and it can be hard to pay for it all and when President Obama gave the ambitious goal to lesson the greenhouse emissions last week ""Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" ""The End of Car Culture"" By:Elisabeth Rosenthal. The usage of less cars can has a great advantage on your wallet.

As said in ""The End of Car Culture"" ""Pedestian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and piblic transportation traffic are woven into a commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected networkto save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Limiting your car usage can have many advantages including making Earth's air cleaner, creating a way for more excessive, and also less expences. Cars will still be in use but maybe we can limit it to only a few.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living has led to a growing trend of limiting car usage in many parts of the world. This shift away from car-centered suburban life has numerous advantages, some of which are highlighted in the passages provided.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or biking, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban, it is evident that the reduction in car usage resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and a noticeable improvement in air quality. Smog, which is a common problem in many cities, is exacerbated by car emissions. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for all residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is mentioned as an example of a car-free district where residents have access to public transportation and amenities within walking or biking distance. This shift in city planning not only reduces the need for extensive road networks and parking spaces but also promotes a sense of community and encourages physical activity.

In addition to the environmental and urban planning benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on our personal well-being. Many residents of Vauban expressed their newfound happiness and reduced stress levels after giving up their cars. The reliance on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, road rage, and the constant rush to get from one place to another. By embracing alternative modes of transportation, individuals can enjoy a slower pace of life and connect more with their surroundings.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages provided, are clear. It not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality but also creates more compact and accessible communities, fosters a sense of community and well-being, and promotes a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of living. As we strive to create a greener and healthier future, limiting car usage is an integral part of the solution.",1
"  A Vision of Urban Sustainability  In our rapidly urbanizing world, the concept of car-free cities is gaining traction as an innovative approach to address the challenges posed by urbanization, environmental degradation, and the need for sustainable living. These cities propose a transformative shift where private automobiles are either severely restricted or entirely absent, promoting sustainable transportation alternatives and greener urban environments. This essay explores the idea of car-free cities, highlighting their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for successful implementation.  Car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on urban living that prioritizes sustainability, health, and community well-being.  Environmental Sustainability: Car-free cities play a pivotal role in addressing climate change by significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This shift toward a more sustainable urban lifestyle is essential in the battle against global warming.  Public Health: These cities emphasize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being among urban residents.  Optimal Use of Urban Space: Car-free cities efficiently repurpose urban space by transforming parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This reconfiguration revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: A reduction in private cars results in less traffic congestion, shorter commutes, and a more stress-free daily urban experience for residents and commuters.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a costly endeavor. By depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, leading to improved financial stability.  Transitioning to car-free cities, however, poses a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, leading to potential resistance to the transition due to concerns about convenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities depends on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are needed to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that rely on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a vital aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living requires comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions for successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthwhile goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments for both keeping the Electoral College and changing to the election by popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a necessary component of our democratic system for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of the outcome. As mentioned in the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote, making it less likely for a tie or major discrepancies to occur.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president elected has trans-regional appeal. This means that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, thereby requiring candidates to campaign in various regions and appeal to a diverse range of voters. This is important as it prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being elected, ultimately benefiting all regions of the country and ensuring that the new president is truly representative of the whole nation.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it focuses campaign efforts on swing states. As noted in the same text, candidates concentrate their campaigns on toss-up states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in swing states receive more attention, information, and consideration from the competing candidates, making them more thoughtful voters. Ultimately, the most thoughtful voters should have the power to decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College gives some weight to large states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. This ensures that candidates pay attention to both large and small states, as they are aware that every state matters in the electoral vote count.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner is produced. This eliminates the complexities and challenges associated with run-off elections, making the presidential election process smoother and more decisive.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states with a predetermined outcome, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely driven by the belief that a single vote may decide an election. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer, nearly half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, despite knowing that their individual vote may not swing the national outcome. Voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preference and exercise their right to vote, regardless of whether their state's outcome is predictable or not.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democratic process. It ensures the certainty of the outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, focuses campaigns on swing states, restores balance among states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While critics argue in favor of a popular vote, the Electoral College provides numerous benefits and safeguards the interests of both large and small states. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing about your stance on this matter and any actions you plan to take on behalf of your constituents.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"After reading a few articles explaining the Electoral College system and reading arguments for and against it, I have decided the system is not worth keeping in place. The system does not take every voter into account, and our electors are not always reliable. Also, this system of voting can discourage citizens in nonswing states from voting, which may be it's greatest crime. The Electoral College is worn out and ready for retirement.

The Electoral College, although seemingly based on the people's votes, is really dependent on whoever the chosen electors want as president. It does not seem very fair for voters to spend months listening to drawn out debates, campaign commercials, and becoming educated on the candidates, just to have their vote essentially thrown away if they did not vote for the majority. No, they do not even get to see their vote in action. It is simply erased and given to a slate of electors who stand for the majority of the state, even if the majority is only 50.1%. To the new generation of voters who really want to make a difference in the government, the idea that unless we pick the right candidate for our state, our votes really do not matter is absurd.

In the electoral college system, even the majority voters in each state can not count on having reliable electors, according to Bradford Plumer, the author of an antiElectoral Collegearticle. Electors can be anyone who does not hold a public office, and these people can be swayed or loyal to their own party as well Plumer. These are the people our votes are really going towards, not the actual president as many uneducated could be led to believe. Although the trust of these people is rarely misplaced Richard A. Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our present method of choosing the President, there is always a possibility of the electors being swayed at the last minute, which is a bit of a scary thought. Imagine if segregationists in the louisiana legislature had succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, one of or best presidents Plumer.

The final reason keeping the Electoral College system in place is a bad idea is that if you are a voter in a clearly defined state, that is, nonswing, you are more likley to decide not to vote at all. When candidates can clearly define states in which they know they will win, or have no hope of winning, they don't bother spending time there to educate voters. Voters in these states do not get all the information they might want in order to make an educated decision. This would lead to a biased, uneducated state in which voters don't care to vote because of a mindset that almost everyone in the state is of a certain political mindset and their vote is just another piece of paper that will not matter. These voters could also make rash decisions because they did not get to truly hear all of the campaignes. In swing states where there is not a clearly defined political opinion, voters will be bombarded with information, and although they may be educated and well versed in their opinions, the votes, no matter how close, will not really matter because of the nature of the Electoral College system.

In closing, the Electoral College system is not worth saving. Although some may argue it gives a certainity of outcome or restores the balance to heavily populated states Posner, it does not give everyone's vote a fair chance. Nor does it guarantee the electors will be reliable. The Electoral College system even dissuades voters from excercising their Constitutional right to vote. Please take this into consideration, Mr. Senator, next time the Electoral College comes into question. Thank you for recieveing my most humble opinion.",0
"  A Path to Sustainable Urban Living  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and escalating environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While there have been calls for its abolition in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential purpose in our democracy. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, and it continues to ensure a fair and balanced representation of state interests in presidential elections.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. In the rare event of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of electoral votes tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. For example, in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes. The winner-take-all system in most states also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters across different states. This ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming successful in a national election.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to focus campaign efforts on swing states. This helps to ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of voters in these states, as they become crucial in deciding the outcome of the election. Voters in swing states are more likely to be informed and thoughtful in their decision-making process, as they know that their votes will have a significant impact.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives weight to larger states in the political balance. Although states are apportioned by population in the Senate, the Electoral College provides a counterbalance to the larger states' influence in presidential elections. This prevents smaller states from being neglected by candidates, as the Electoral College gives them a proportionate number of electoral votes based on their population.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the need for potentially complicated run-off elections. The winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College ensures that a majority winner is produced, avoiding the need for second-round elections. This streamlines the election process and provides a clear and decisive result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy by ensuring that all states have a fair representation in the presidential election. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses efforts on swing states, balances the influence of larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in maintaining a fair and balanced electoral process.

I urge you to consider these points and support the preservation of the Electoral College system. It is a cornerstone of our democratic process and has served our nation well for over two centuries. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your continued dedication to upholding the values of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage can have many advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided offer insight into the benefits of reducing car dependence, including improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased accessibility to public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. By limiting car usage, we can create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on air quality. According to the passage about Paris banning driving due to smog, the temporary driving ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality in the city. The passage also highlights the negative effects of diesel fuel, which is a major contributor to air pollution. By reducing car usage, especially cars that run on diesel fuel, we can significantly reduce air pollution and improve the overall health of our communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our reliance on cars and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. This is particularly important in light of President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, as mentioned in the passage about the end of car culture.

Limiting car usage also leads to more accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes how the community is designed to be car-free, with limited parking spaces and a focus on walking and biking. This creates a more compact and pedestrian-friendly environment, where shops, services, and public transportation are easily accessible. Other examples, such as the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, show that alternative transportation options can be successful on a larger scale. By creating communities that prioritize public transportation and active modes of transportation, we can increase accessibility for all residents and reduce traffic congestion.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It improves air quality, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and creates more accessible communities. The passages provided highlight the success of car-free initiatives in various cities around the world, demonstrating that it is possible to live without cars. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and designing communities with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, we can create more sustainable and livable cities.",1

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College system, rather than switching to election by popular vote, is crucial for protecting our democratic principles and ensuring a fair representation of all states within the country.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process involves the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The allocation of electors is based on each state's Congressional delegation, providing representation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures certainty of outcome. Due to the winner-take-all system employed by most states, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the outcome of the election, as the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes is declared the winner. In contrast, a direct popular vote could potentially lead to prolonged disputes and recounting of votes, as seen in the 2000 election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is the need for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign across various regions and build a broad coalition of support. In turn, this helps to ensure that the winning candidate has national appeal and can effectively represent the interests of the entire country. Without this requirement, there is a risk of a candidate with only regional appeal winning the presidency, which could lead to feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system places importance on swing states, thereby granting more attention to the issues and concerns of those states. Campaign efforts are concentrated in toss-up states, which leads to increased engagement and thoughtful voting among their residents. This ensures that swing states, and the diverse perspectives they represent, play a significant role in deciding the election outcome.

The Electoral College also helps to restore balance to the political influence of large and small states. While the Senate provides representation for small states through equal representation, the Electoral College allows large states to have a greater say in the election. This balance is crucial for ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of heavily populated areas but also consider the interests of smaller states.

Lastly, the use of the Electoral College system avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This prevents additional complexity in the election process and ensures a clear winner is determined.

While there are arguments for switching to a direct popular vote, it is important to note that such a change would undermine the principles on which our electoral system was built. The Electoral College helps to maintain a balance of power between states, encourages broader national campaigns, and ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions of the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides essential benefits including certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, focus on swing states, balance of power between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections. By preserving the Electoral College, we can uphold the democratic principles and ensure fair representation for all states within our great nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and continue to support its retention in our presidential elections.

"When you vote for president you want to vote for who you choose. Thats not how it always works though. We you vote for president you are actually voting for a candidate who will then go and vote for president. Is that really fair? Many people dont think so. The electoral college should be abolished because it isnt always fair, who cant be sure if your voting right and it is not democracy.

When you vote for a candidate you trust they will vote for who they say they will. but is it always true? what is the candidate feels like they dont agree with that person any more and vote for a different one? You and everybody else who voted for that canadaite are now voting for an opposing candidate. is that fair to who ever voted for that candidate now?

You can never be sure if you are voting right. what if that candidate dose not vote like they are supposed too. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" says Plumer about the chance a candidate will vote for someone else. You can never really trust someone you have never met. Humans are very despitefully creatures, we all lie and decive. how can you trust a random canadite just because he says he or she will vote for who you want to vote for? wouldnt you rather vote yourself?

Democracy is giving people the rigth to help govern there own country. Isnt the electoral collage taking that right away? Even though this is in the Constitution it is unconstitutional. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to all voters."" says Plumer. He is correct about the electoral college and its unfairness to US citizens.

The electoral colleage may have had a good reasson for existing when they made the constution but that was about a 100 years ago... Dont you think we have chaged since then? The anwser is we have and so should they way our goverment works. If we keep the same goverment into the future where everything will change we will be in for a load of trouble.",0
"Throughout the past century car usage has exploded from a luxury available only to the highest echelon of society to a tool almost essential to life. Although cars are convenient there are many downsides to having them. Some reasons a society that limits car use could be beneficial are: expenses, environmental costs, and health degredation. Hopefully together we can curb car usage and lead the way for a cheaper, greener, and healthier future.

Its a known fact that cars are expensive, but when you add up all of the costs how much is really spent. Especially for younger drivers insurance is a ludicrous expense, often totalling hundreds of dollars per month. Another expense, obviously, is gas. Gas may be at a 5 year low right now but the slightest instability in oil producing countries could cause prices to skyrocket. Still if you add in the cost of the car your looking at a highly expensive way of living. Life obviously could be less expensive without car use.

Another illeffect of car use is environmental impact. car emissions are responsible for up to 50 percent of total green house gas emissions in some states. Using cars is not good for the environment. Cars pollute are atmosphere and can accelerate the rate of ozone layer deterioration. They also, indirectly, damage habitats by requiring new roads and highways to be built thus disturbing ecosystems. Automobiles also use large quantities of petroleum a finite and ever necessary resource in this global world. Car usage needs to be drastically reduced in order to preserve the environment.

Health issues can also develop from overusing cars. For instance, by looking at cultures that do not use cars it is evident that less children with autism are born to said peoples, such as the Amish. Another benefit of not using cars is exercise. People that drive instead of walking or bicycling are not only becoming more obese they are also putting themselves at an elevated risk for heart disease. Car accidents are one of the highest causes of premature death in the united states thus if people drove less these accidents would occur far less often. The choice seems clear a carless society is more healthy for all.

All in all, although cars may have benefits, the drawbacks of having them far out way any of said benefits. Car usage is expensive, bad for the environment and unhealthy. Together, society must ultimately decide whether life with automobiles is worth it and live with the consequences.",0
"For the past few years, people have come to theories that the Electoral College is flawed. Citizens have come to this conclusion due to the fact that Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFLCIO, all agreed to abolish the electoral college. Also, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind the U.S. is using now. Finally, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who then, in turn, elect the president. The election system should be changed to popular vote for the President of the United States because the system is more reliable, and the president is chosen by the people.

Due to past problems in the Electoral College, people can come to a conclusion and say that the popular vote system is more reliable. As mentioned in Source 2, Bradford Plumer says that, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The Electoral College was to be blamed when in 2000, the electors defied the will of the people. On the contrary, as stated in Source 1, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Even the Founding Fathers believed in the vote from the people to elect their leader, but it has shifted away from it.

It was always believed that the people elected the president, but it has been proved that it isnt that way. As mentioned in Source 3, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election."" Due to the Electoral College, voters, knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were chosen by popular vote. This shows that if citizens knew that their votes were for voting for someone to elect their president, they would lose interest and stop voting.

Overall, the popular vote system is more reliable because of the vote of the citizens, rather from a slate of electors. Also, it was believed that people elected the president, but in reality, people voted for electors to vote for their president. Next, the Electoral College has many flaws, one of them being that the electors defy the will of the people. And also, that electors may be replaced on purpose to go against a candidate. Finally, the Electoral College should be abolished because it is unfair, outdated, and irrational.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provide examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to promote alternative transportation and reduce car dependence, and these examples serve as evidence for the benefits of such initiatives.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in suburban areas where car usage is high. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative forms of transportation like public transit or cycling, communities can make significant strides in reducing their carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passages highlight how smog and pollution levels decreased when driving was restricted in Paris and Bogota. These cities experienced a significant decrease in congestion and smog when cars were banned or limited to certain days. This improved air quality has health benefits for residents, as poor air quality can lead to respiratory issues and other health problems.

Limiting car usage also has positive implications for urban planning and city design. The passages mention the concept of ""smart planning,"" where suburbs are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation. This includes placing stores and services within walking distance, rather than having them spread out along highways. This type of planning promotes walkability and reduces the need for cars, resulting in more livable and sustainable communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passages mention how car-free initiatives can lead to the development of alternative transportation infrastructure, such as bike lanes and public transit systems. This can create job opportunities and boost the local economy. Additionally, households that choose to forgo car ownership can save money on car-related expenses like gas, maintenance, and insurance.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, ranging from environmental benefits like reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality, to improved urban planning and economic benefits. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and implementing measures to reduce car dependence, communities and cities can create more sustainable and livable environments for their residents.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After thoroughly examining the arguments from both sides, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be preserved for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a disputed outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. Stability and legitimacy are crucial in any democratic process, and the Electoral College provides this by avoiding prolonged election disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents all regions of the country, not just specific areas with high population density. As Judge Posner argues, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College guarantees that the president will consider the interests and concerns of all regions, preventing regional disenfranchisement.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, which results in a more engaged and informed electorate. The system incentivizes candidates to pay attention to states that can swing either way, leading to more thoughtful and informed voters. This ensures that the election outcome is not solely determined by a few heavily populated states, but rather by a wide range of states with diverse priorities and perspectives.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives weight to the political balance of large states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, large states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This mechanism balances the influence of small and large states, enabling candidates to address the concerns of both densely populated urban areas and less populated rural areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which simplifies and streamlines the presidential election process. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, preventing prolonged periods of uncertainty or the need for additional voting rounds. By avoiding run-off elections, the system promotes efficiency and maintains the democratic principles of representative government.

While some argue that the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College can lead to candidates ignoring states they have no chance of winning, it is important to note that candidates have limited campaign resources and must prioritize areas where they have the greatest opportunity for success. The Electoral College ensures that candidates focus on competitive states, giving a fair chance for all voices to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, representation, engagement, balance, and efficiency in the presidential election process. It guarantees a clear outcome, ensures presidential representation for all regions, promotes thoughtful voter participation, balances the interests of small and large states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and to support its continuation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the dependency on cars, we can achieve several positive outcomes such as mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and enhancing overall quality of life.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change. For example, the German community of Vauban has implemented car-free streets, resulting in 70% of families not owning cars and a decrease in emissions. This trend is also seen in the United States, where recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior has the potential to positively impact carbon emissions and contribute to President Obama’s goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution demonstrates the immediate impact of reducing car usage. During the ban, congestion was reduced by 60% and smog levels dropped significantly. This not only benefits the environment but also the health of individuals living in these areas. By relying less on cars, we can decrease air pollution and create healthier and cleaner communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly enhance overall quality of life. The passage about the German community of Vauban highlights how residents have found more happiness and relaxation since giving up their cars. The absence of cars allows for quieter and safer streets, where the sounds of bicycles and children replace the noise of engines. Additionally, limiting car usage often results in more compact and accessible communities. Instead of relying on cars to reach stores and services, these communities prioritize walking and public transportation. This promotes a more active lifestyle and fosters a sense of community and social interactions.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and the environment. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance overall quality of life. By implementing car-free streets and promoting alternative transportation modes, we can mitigate the negative impact of car usage and create more sustainable and livable communities.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and the method we use to elect the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College system.

One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College, as explained in the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, is the certainty of outcome. The Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory. The chance of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely. This certainty of outcome provides stability and avoids disputes over the popular vote results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a President who appeals to different regions of the country. As mentioned in Judge Posner's text, no single region has enough electoral votes to guarantee a candidate's victory. Therefore, candidates must have trans-regional appeal to secure the required number of electoral votes. This prevents candidates from focusing only on certain regions and neglecting the interests of others. It ensures that the elected President represents the entire nation and not just a particular region.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus on swing states during their campaign, as explained by Judge Posner. These states are where the outcome is uncertain and can go either way. By concentrating their efforts on these states, candidates have to address the issues that matter most to voters in those swing states. This results in a more thoughtful and informed campaign, where candidates pay close attention to the concerns of the voters.

Additionally, the Electoral College system restores some balance to the political weight of large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as mentioned in Judge Posner's text, can lead to large states losing some influence. However, the Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of residents in these states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can complicate the electoral process. However, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner and avoids potential confusion or delays caused by run-off elections.

While I acknowledge the arguments made in favor of changing to a popular vote system, as mentioned in the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer, I believe that the strengths of the Electoral College outweigh its limitations. It provides stability, prevents disputes, encourages broader regional appeal, promotes thoughtful campaigning in swing states, balances the influence of larger and smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College system as you make decisions that impact the future of our democracy.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the topic of the Electoral College and the potential change to direct election by popular vote for the President of the United States. With the upcoming election, it is crucial to reconsider the merits of the Electoral College and the impact it has on our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between electing the President through Congress and electing the President through a popular vote of qualified citizens. It serves as a process to ensure that each state has a fair representation based on its population. As stated in the text from the Office of the Federal Register, each state is allotted a number of electors based on its representatives in the House of Representatives and Senators. This ensures a balance of power between densely populated states and smaller states. Changing to a direct popular vote would give undue influence to heavily-populated states, while neglecting the interests of smaller states.

Furthermore, keeping the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he received only 51.3% of the popular votes. This highlights the importance of the Electoral College in ensuring that the winning candidate has a clear majority in terms of electoral votes. If we were to rely solely on the popular vote, close elections could create greater uncertainty and disputes over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. The Electoral College serves as a safeguard against such disputes, making it less likely that the winner of the popular vote will lose the presidency.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it requires presidential candidates to have broad support across different regions of the country. As Judge Richard A. Posner states in his defense of the Electoral College, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This ensures that candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters across different states and regions. It promotes a sense of national unity and avoids a situation where a candidate with only regional appeal becomes president. The Electoral College forces candidates to campaign in various states, including swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This engages voters and allows for a more thorough and representative electoral process.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large states. With the current apportionment of the Senate, large states have less representation compared to their population size. The Electoral College gives large states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as their electoral votes hold greater weight. This ensures that candidates have to consider the concerns and interests of voters in all states, regardless of their size.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to be determined. This is crucial in avoiding extended election processes and potential complications that could arise from run-off elections. The Electoral College ensures that the results are decisive and the president is chosen without the need for further voting.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the claim that it is unfair to voters and disadvantages certain states, the advantages and practical reasons for retaining it outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College maintains a balance of power between states, ensures certainty of outcome, promotes national unity, encourages candidates to campaign in a diverse range of states, balances the political power of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the merits of keeping the Electoral College intact as it provides an effective and fair process for electing the President of the United States. While improvements may be necessary to address certain concerns, completely abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the principles of our democracy and the importance of state representation. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is a process of selecting electors to vote for the president. The Electoral College has both its pros and cons, many reasons for it to stay or be abolished. However, it has more reason to stay rather than changing to election by popular vote for the President. The wnning candidate for U.S President should be who's the best rather rather than who's more popular. The Electoral College may not be the most democratic method but, it does create a sense of balance. The Electoral College has equal tranregional appeal, and guarantees an outcome. therefore, the Electoral College should not be abolished.

The Electoral College guarantees an outcome. With popular voting and a tie could occur. As, source 3 ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" informs ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariable exceeds his share of the popular vote.""18. So the losing candidate could argue that winner isn't who the people want however, it's the political party members who chose the electors. In, Source 1 ""What is the Electoral College?"", it states that ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party..."" Therefore, there is no mystery or deceit, each party knows their electors and candidates so the people are the ones who indirectly chose the winner. As a result, the Electoral College promises an undebatabe outcome.

Also,the Electoral College doesn't have any prejudice based on region or location. ""The Electoral College requires to have a transregional appeal."" source 3. Therefore, a candidate has to campiaign in all regions, withought just focusing on just one. So every region has an equal oppurtunity and knowledge to be able to vote. Also this way there's a less chance of ""The residents of other reions to feel disenfranchisedto feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president.""19. That feeling of equality and ""my opinion matters"" is exactly what America is about and this aspect of the Electoral College captures that beautifully.

In conclusion, the Electoral college may not be the most democratic way of voting however, it is quite fair. If we only had popular voting candidates would possible just focuse on one are to build a strong support base. This would'nt give every region or person a fair chance and strong word, which is against everything America stands for. Equality is one of the major virtues of America and the Electoral College expresses equality through balance more so than popular vote. The Electoral College guarantees a certaint outcome without debates or tie breakers. It allows every region to have a fair chance in the election by making sure they are well informed and included through the recquirment of transregional appeal. For these reasons the Electoral College should not be abolished and changed to popular vote for United States of America.",0
"Automobiles have proved to be very convenient to our modern day society. It allows people to travel 20 miles in ten to fifteen minutes. By foot, it would take about four hours to travel that distance. Although cars have been beneficial, the limitation of car usage would outweigh the benefits of constantly relying on them. Decreasing the amount of time we spend in them would improve public transportation, improve air quality, and create less stress.

Cutting down the amount of car usage would encourage the use of public transportation. According to Source 1, the essentially carless suburban, Vanbaun, has made public transportation more accessible. Increasing the use of it would decrease the time it takes to commute from place to place. Less cars on the roads mean less traffic. In small towns, not as many people currently use the system on a regular basis. With the limiting of car usage, public transportation could become more popular in suburban areas, not just metropolitan cities. Some may not want to take this form of transportation because it may not meet their sanitary needs. However, if the popularity increases, cities will be obligated to improve the conditions. Public transportation could be the new primary form of transportation if we limit the amount of time cars are allowed to be used.

Additionally, a large problem in the world today is air pollution and global warming. Automobiles cause the majority of this ongoing problem. Less time spent in the car would eventually lead to better air quality. Source 2 states that in Paris, France the smog in the city was nearrecord pollution. This caused Paris to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Congestion was cut down 60% after this action was taken. Vehicles release numerous harmful greenhouse gases that we have been trying to reduce. These gases not only harm the environment, but the people as well. New and popular alternatives to the common diesel cars are hybrids and electric cars. Less car usage would result in reduction of pollution.

Also, using a car less decreases stress levels. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in the very popular carfree day. A businessman in Colombia said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" Cars do not allow people's mind to stop and rest. A driver's mind is constantly thinking and attempting to get to their destination as fast as possible. If cars were barely used, people could take a serene stroll to their destination, allowing the mind to slow down, think, and relax. Parks and recreation would expand and improve as well due to the smaller vicinity we can reach by foot or bike. New and improved public areas would become more enjoyable, making us less stressed. Stress levels decline as car usage declines.

The increased use of public transportation, improved air quality, and lower stress levels all result from the limitations of car usage. As beneficial as a car may be to people, limiting the use of it is more advantageous than not. Car companies are still widely developing as highways and roads are expanding, but our society should go the other direction and find healthier sources of transportation.",0
"""All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car and that would have to change' said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation of America. It is imperative that our fellow citizens take the initiative to limit car usage for the whole purpose of saving time,conserving resources,lowering emissions and improving safety for ourselves and others.

Limiting car usage is an effective way in reducing our air pollutionsmog.Most of our greenhouses gases are the result from the use of car or fuel engineered automobiles.

Source 1:In german Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars states that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some carintensive area in the United States"", this means that most of our greenhouse gases are resulting from the overusage of cars that emit an abundance of CO2 into the atmosphere which generally has a negative effect on the environment. If car usage were to be limited that would mean the greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced which will then lead to a reduction in air pollution. Implementing the reduction of car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment,since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,just behind power plants.

Car usage has contributed to cities low safety level. This is because cities are more denser with the use of more and more cars. If car usage were to be limited that would mean that these cities would be better to walk around in and other alternative transportation methods such as bicycling and public transit have an easier way of getting around to save time according to Source 4: The End of Car Culture.

This implication may have a negative result in lost revenue in the car industry,but which is more important the world we live in or money? There are many more alternatives than using cars that emit greenhouse gases such as plugin cars,hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers as stated in Source 2: Paris Bans Driving due to Smog.

With the reduction in car usage that would mean that the resources that were needed to support the vehicle would be conserved because there would only be a small amoun of it being used. With the reduction in the usage of the fuels then the the remaing amount would be for other purposes that would need it or be saved over time if the US were to need it in the future.

To conclude if limiting car usage would be in then it would just have a positive efeect in the worl we live in. Not only will limiting car use would reduce the amount of smog being produced but it will also increase the United States safety level and conseverve the resources as well.",0
"Limiting car usage has a multitude of advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. As seen in the passages, there are several successful examples of car-free communities and initiatives that have proven to be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the quality of life for residents.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a substantial percentage of emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, we can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and alternative modes of transportation are encouraged, 70% of families do not own cars. This demonstrates that it is possible to live without cars and still have a functional and vibrant community.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality and reduce pollution. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog illustrates the negative impact of excessive car usage on the environment. The city experienced near-record pollution levels, which prompted the enforcement of a partial driving ban. As a result, congestion decreased by 60% and the quality of air improved. This example shows that by reducing car usage, we can mitigate air pollution and create healthier living environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative and sustainable modes of transportation. By restricting car usage, communities like Bogota in Colombia have seen a rise in alternative transportation methods such as biking, walking, and public transit. Bogota's car-free day has become a successful event that encourages residents to find alternative ways of commuting. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes physical activity and healthier lifestyles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is an example of a community that has adopted smart planning principles by placing stores within walking distance and minimizing the need for extensive parking spaces. This approach not only makes it more convenient for residents to access essential services but also fosters a sense of community and reduces dependence on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve our environment, reduce emissions, and enhance the quality of life in our communities. The passages provide evidence of successful car-free communities and initiatives that have shown positive results in terms of reduced emissions, improved air quality, and increased use of alternative transportation. By embracing these examples and implementing similar strategies, we can move towards a future where limited car usage becomes the norm, benefiting both individuals and the planet.",1

Subject: The Electoral College: A System of Balance and Representation

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is an essential part of our democratic process that ensures representation and protects the interests of all states.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This system consists of the selection of electors, their meeting and voting for the President and Vice President, followed by the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It is a carefully designed process that ensures a fair and balanced election.

One of the advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. While disputes over the final result can occur, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This prevents lengthy debates and recounts that could potentially destabilize the nation. In addition, the winner-take-all system ensures a clear, decisive victory and minimizes the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election of the President. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of all states, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas. This prevents the dominance of a few states over the entire election process, ensuring a more balanced representation.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This leads to increased campaign efforts and attention from the candidates, allowing voters in these states to make more informed decisions. Centralizing the election process through a popular vote would result in candidates concentrating their efforts on densely populated urban areas, ignoring the needs and concerns of the majority of the country.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives due weight to large states, addressing the malapportionment of the Senate described in the Constitution. The winner-take-all system means that candidates pay more attention to large states, as winning by a slight margin in a large state can secure a significant number of electoral votes. This ensures that the interests and concerns of these states are taken into account during the campaign and presidency.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This system produces a clear winner and avoids the complications and uncertainties that would arise from run-off elections. It maintains the stability and efficiency of our election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College can discourage potential voters who live in states with political leanings opposite to their own, the voter turnout in presidential elections speaks for itself. Nearly half of the eligible American population participated in the 2012 election, indicating that people vote to express their political preferences, not with the belief that their vote alone will change the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College ensures fairness, balance, and representation in the election of the President of the United States. It prevents any single state or region from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of all states. I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College, a system that has proved its effectiveness for over two centuries.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College and make a decision that upholds the principles of our democratic system.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Cars, they're one of the most important means of transportation, varying from busses down to smart cars. The more cars being bought and used, the more pollution it makes. Researchers are saying that cars, their dense amount of smog being created, are damaging the Earth. Logically, it would be easier to say that limiting the amount of vehicles being used would allow for a cleaner city or town.

Limiting car usage in the past and present already shows a positive feed back upon the community. There has been cities dedicated to create a carfree city. An example would be in Vauban, Germany. There the city runs purely on no car usage and showed to be much cleaner, safer, and easier to navigate around in. It says in the first passage how the city is ""...better for walking..."" and that it is ""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation..."" In other areas, where car usage is an everyday expense, they have started to enforce driving bans to reduce pollution in the area. In Paris, they almost reached nearrecord pollution which reduced greatly ever since the ban. They limited the use of cars has cleaned the air and their ""congestion"" was down 60 percent allowing getting around easier. Although having car free cities and bans, others thing differently.

Others, whom oppose the idea of limiting cars use, has done research to show that it isn't necessary to limit car usage. They state that in America ""Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars"" They claim that the drop of purchasing and that the usage of cars is dropping to the point where pollution won't raise up anymore. In source 4, it states ""If the patterns persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" It also states that people will ""find less reason to resume the habit"" Although some advantages are seen in the opposing ideas, it still would not be enough. The passage focuses to much in one area instead of looking around. Limiting car usage would assist around the world proving to be much efficient. There are programs that are created to reduce the usage of cars for one day, which showed to be a success. In source 3 it shows how 118 miles of bicycle paths has been created since the day. Also shows how the day cut traffic and allowed for constructions of new buildings to be much easier to do. People started to go outside to the point where ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota.

The advantages of car limitations has shown to be much more efficient and benificial towards cities and towns which participated in it. The advantages are that it made the town more productive, cleaner, efficient, and better to walk around in. Car limitations has proven to be an outstanding practice to be used around the world.",0
"Dear, state Senator Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not visited or spoken to from the president other than small states. Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1 explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states.

Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors, for example ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated "" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy"". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems.

The electors want to cast in more votes from big states other than small states. Source 2 quoted "" Because of the take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states.

Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not visited or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors, many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.",0
"Limiting car usage is a great idea. If this ever does happen it will be a new Revolution for us all. Some might say that its outrageous and unthinkable but it will benefit us in many ways. If we limit car usage there will be less pollution, less stress, less traffic, more outside activities which means being healthier and last but not least it will be safer.

To begin with, with limited car usage there will be less pollution and less stress. Most of our pollution comes from cars, the smoke that the engine of the car lets out causes it. For example, Paris suffered a ""nearrecord pollution"" source 2 due to the diesel. But after they enforced a fine of 22 euro ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France""source 2. Don't you think that this is a positive outcome and this is benefiting us? Polution is a very important issue in the United States and we need to fix it or at least try. Now lets talk about stress, everybody has stress even if its from school, work, family etc. And everybody wants to have the least amount of stress as possible or no stress at all. If we limit the car use that will be taking a stress away from oneself, ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""source 1. Because that way parents dont have to worry whether their kids will get home safely. They wont have to worry about if they got into an accident, if after the party they drived home intoxicated. Car accidents are very common in the United States and has caused many deaths so why not reduce that number,of deaths, and reduce car usage in the process? And not only for parents ,but elderly as well because some senior citizens still drive with or without license and that could cause a mayor incident.

Furthermore, by redusing car usage there will be more outdoor activities which means that it will be a lot more healthier. Think about it, by driving a car you dont exercise but if a person walks to a place, they are exersicing. For example, in German Suburb people have a limited car usage and you can hear the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant motor""source 1. The person could hear the outside activity and not the sound of cars passing by which means there was interaction between folks. Also, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city...""source 3 and isnt the government,especially Michelle Obama, trying to always give out messages of not only eating helathy but playing outside and interact with the community? well this is one way we can support that. Plus in this 21st century kids are always on their phones, tablets, computer and when they go out its to hang out with friends at the movies a party but they use cars. If the car usage is limited they wont have that many options and they could interact outside of their little ""bubble"". What ever way you look at this its gonna be a positive outcome even if its small.

Moreover, by reducing car usage there will be definetely less traffic and it will be a new beginning. To prove this points, in Bogota, Colombia ""million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated ot took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" source 3. People hate traffic, it has not been known a person that doesnt. So, reducing car usage is equal to reducing traffic jams, why not do it then? Now it was never said that there will be absolutely no cars just the decrease with it. There will be public transportations like taxis and buses but even if those where still be able to be used there wont be as much traffic. It is understandable that people sometimes need to get to places where you cant really walk to get there so the public transportation will be permitted. Also this will mean a ""new beginning"", Enrique Riera, mayor of Praguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing boreders,"" source 3. This statement says it all a ""revolutionary change"" its what we need. People are depending in cars so much and thats not good.

To end this thoughts, it is a great idea to limit the usage of cars. People will have one less thing to worry about and who woulnt like that huh? Also it will be healthy for the environment and the citizens and lets not forget, there will be less of a traffic jam. Plus it will be a big change but at the same time it wouldnt because statistics have shown that "" Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" source 4. So it already started little by little we just have to accelerated the process a bit more.""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" source 4,just think about all the positive outcomes of this change.",0
"The Electoral College vote draws many emotions. It has many supporters and many enemies. There was a huge debate over the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College destroys some of the integrity of the american democracy. I believe this is due to the winner takes all system of the Electoral College.

The Electoral College says whoever has the majority of votes in a state receives all that states votes. I believe this corrupts the system because so many peoples votes go unaccounted. If one party has 51 percent of the vote the other 49 percent of the votes don't count. This is why I believe that we need to abolish the Electoral College.

In a true democracy the people vote for a president and the ideal behind the Electoral College is that it eliminates uneducated votes. I believe that it doesn't do this very well and may actually harm the system even more. Peoples votes elect electors who elect the President in the Electoral College system. These electors are put in a spot of significant power. The question is who are these electors. It is very possible that they can vote for the opposite party of that which they were elected to vote for. Scandals like this have occurred in the past what is stopping them form continuing in the future.

Another major problem of the Electoral College is with the winner takes all system if a state is known to be a majority one party or another there is no use for someone in the minority party to vote because they have no effect. This allows citizens who are supposed to help elect Americas leaders to be unable to have any say in the government. The ideal behind a democracy is that the people rule and the Electoral College is destroying the democracy because it is restricting people form taking active participation in what they are entitled too as a citizen. Without the Electoral College there might be some uneducated votes but the popular vote upholds the integrity of the democracy that America thrives on. The popular vote also eliminates the chance of any major scandals that could majorly affect the presidential election.",0

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures a certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard Posner points out, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This certainty of outcome is crucial for maintaining stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a strong sense of unity and representation. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no single region can dominate the election. This means that a candidate with only regional support is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Therefore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide and develop policies that take into account the diverse needs and perspectives of various regions.

The system also gives more weight to swing states, which encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states. As a result, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, be well-informed about the candidates, and make thoughtful decisions. This is important for ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters have the final say in determining the outcome of the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides representation for both large and small states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on densely populated areas, the Electoral College guarantees that candidates must consider the interests of smaller states as well. This balance is necessary to ensure that all states have a voice and are not overwhelmed by the influence of a few densely populated areas.

Finally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the election process. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College provides a streamlined and efficient method for electing the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and effective mechanism for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes national unity and representation, encourages attention to swing states, provides a voice for both larger and smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments for a popular vote system, the benefits offered by the Electoral College outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College system. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need further information.

Sincerely,

"Dear state senator, The electoral college is an unfair and irrational, and should be abolished immediately. The fact that the race for president can end in a tie is completely absurd. Also the fact that popular vote can mean basically nothing is dumbfoundidng. In a country of democracy popular vote seems like a it would be standard. popular vote seems like the best idea when it comes to a country for the people.

The electoral college is highly unfair to voters. Presidential candidates dont even have to visit all of the states to win the elections. The representation that the smaller states get is unfair. Presidential candidates will only visit states with a high number electoral college representatives because the states are known as ""swing states"". Swing states greatly influence the outcome of the election because they can hold the most power. If a state such as texas with 34 electoral votes was to have the same amount of power as a state with a much smaller population than the electoral college would seem much more viable.

The electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with that states popular vote. Al Gore, in the 2000 presidential election, won the popular vote but still lost the electionPlumer 9. The fact that a candidate can win the vote of the people but still lose the election is horrifying. How can you trust a system that works against what the United States of America is about. It completely takes away the right of people to decide what goes on in there government. The fact that the electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with people is highly unfair.

There is one crucial flaw in the electoral college, the election can end in a tie. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if just 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other wayPlumer 12. If we were to switch to a system were all states including the District of Columbia get one vote then the election could never end in a tie. Although this still seems highly unfair to the voters because the representative could go either with or against the popular vote the election could still never end in a tie solving the amjor flaw. What was to happen if we did have a tie? It has not yet been desided because it never has happened and that is a major problem.

The electoral college is highly unfair and should be disposed of immediately. The electoral college is biased towards the larger states,has major flaws that can only be fixed by getting rid of the system and does not give a fair view of what the people want. The system was poorly thought out and needs to be replaced.

sincerely, Jordan P.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, I have decided to express my opinion to you about the Electoral College process for electing the President of the United States. This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinion. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligible American citizens to decide presidency.

Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Some people may also say that the Electoral college encourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as california who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes.

In grade school we are taught that popular votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, why dont we use it in the real world? If your principle wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! In the Bush and Gore election, Bush received less votes by the American people but won presidency because he acquired more Electoral votes than Gore. That means that more American people wanted Gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected Bush as the winner!

The Electoral College also increases the risk of a tie and if one occurred, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors.

The overall idea im trying to express is that the Electoral College is a poor way to show peoples opinion, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the President of the United States. I hope you can see my points and I long for the day when the president is decided by the people.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement around the world to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from the reliance on automobiles in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve overall quality of life. Several examples from different countries highlight the advantages of limiting car usage in suburban areas.

One such example is the community of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden in Vauban, making the streets completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. The residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less tense without the constant reliance on cars.

Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced after days of intense smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. The ban aimed to reduce air pollution and promote alternative transportation. Despite the inconveniences, many people supported the ban as a way to lower air pollution and stress levels.

Bogota, Colombia, has also implemented a car-free day as part of an improvement campaign. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during the car-free day, leaving the streets eerily empty of traffic jams. The event aims to promote alternative transportation options and reduce smog. Other Colombian cities have joined the initiative, and municipal authorities from other countries have expressed interest in implementing similar programs.

The trend towards limiting car usage in suburban areas is not limited to Europe and South America. In the United States, there has been a decrease in car ownership and driving, even before the economic downturn. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. This shift in behavior could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions in the US.

The advantages of limiting car usage in suburban areas are numerous. By reducing reliance on cars, communities can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Car-free neighborhoods also promote healthier and more active lifestyles, as residents are more likely to walk or use bicycles for transportation. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to less congestion and traffic, making streets safer and improving overall quality of life for residents.

Overall, limiting car usage in suburban areas is a step towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future. By adopting smart planning principles and promoting alternative transportation options, communities can reduce their carbon footprint and improve the well-being of their residents.",1
"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME, The purpose of this letter is to fight for the cause of removing the Electoral College and voting simply by popular vote. With evidence from ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" by Richard A. Ponser, I will elaborate on this subject. Now, since I am only fourteen, I do not claim to have all knowledge and be an expert on this method of voting, but it is not the way to choose our country's leader.

The Electoral College is a compromise between who the people of America chose and who Congress has chosen. This is an incorrect method of selecting the President. The Constitution states that we the people have the choice to select our government not Congress. Yes, the constitutions founding fathers also established the Electoral College, but it is a thing of the past. As Richard A. Ponser writes, an ""anchorism"" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 1, if you will. Moreover, the Electoral College does not belong in this day and age it is something that is outdated and in need of replacement.

The Electoral College also does not allow citizens to exercise their right to vote for their President, since Congress also has their say in the matter. The voting process was created for the citizens not the people who are in the government. In fact, Bradford Plumer states that ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The Indefensible Electoral College, par. 1 This process of voting for President is undesired and despised my many people, by over half of the voters in America. The Office of the Federal Register writes that the Electoral College is ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" Why does Congress have any sort of influence or say in this matter? The people choose their government not the governemt itself!

Alright, the Electoral College is something that should not be used, by I can see the point of its purpose. The popular vote of the citizens can be infulenced by others, or advertisements and propoganda from political parties. Some voters are biased and overlook the negative things of the candidates because they do not wish to believe that this person does not support or believe everything they do. The Electoral College helps to balance that out. ""No region... has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 5 Richard A. Ponser asserts this in his article, as well as the fact that no region or place has any reason to go about ""increasing his plurality"" par. 5 to make sure that a candidate will win. The Electoral College prevents this, resulting in a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and Congress.

To come to a conclusion, I have stated that the Electoral College is not a method that should be used to choose the President of the United States. It is outdated and does not allow citizens to choose the leader of their country. However, is balances out the popular vote and the Congress's vote.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.",0

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and to argue in favor of keeping it, as opposed to changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in various texts, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that the Electoral College remains the most effective and beneficial method of electing our nation's leader.

One of the key reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive outcome. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, unlike what may occur in a direct popular vote system.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This helps to prevent the election of a candidate with only regional support, promoting national unity and representation for all citizens.

The existence of swing states is another significant advantage of the Electoral College system, as explained by Judge Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are compelled to pay closer attention to the concerns, interests, and needs of these states and their constituents. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as swing state voters play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not overlooked, as highlighted by Judge Posner. In a campaign, presidential candidates give more attention to states with larger populations due to the number of electoral votes at stake. This balances the political influence of large states, counteracting the mal-apportionment of power caused by the Senate's constitutional mandate for equal representation of each state.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, as mentioned by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes to secure the presidency, the system avoids the complications and costs associated with subsequent run-off elections. Instead, it ensures a clear winner, promoting stability and efficiency in the election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states considered ""safe"" for a particular party, it is important to emphasize that voters are motivated by their desire to express a political preference, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. The knowledge that their vote may not directly impact the election's outcome does not prevent individuals from participating in the democratic process and exercising their right to vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial institution that upholds the principles of our Constitution and supports our democratic system. Its preservation ensures a fair and representative election process, while promoting national unity, thoughtful campaigning, and the importance of every region's voice. For these reasons, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective and weigh it alongside the views of others to make an informed decision that best serves our nation's interests. I appreciate your dedication and service to our state and our country.

Sincerely,

"  Redefining Urban Living  In an era characterized by escalating urbanization and pressing environmental concerns, the idea of car-free cities is gaining momentum as an innovative approach to address the multifaceted challenges of urban life. Car-free cities advocate for a transformation where private automobiles are either significantly restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a more sustainable urban environment. This essay explores the concept of car-free cities, focusing on their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities present a vision of urban living that prioritizes sustainability, public health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a vital role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.  Public Health: Car-free cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents.  Optimal Space Utilization: These cities efficiently repurpose urban space by transforming parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful urban experience for residents and commuters.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a substantial financial burden. By depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, contributing to their overall financial well-being.  However, transitioning to car-free cities poses several unique challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions for successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College system for selecting the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the arguments presented both in favor of keeping the current system and changing to a popular vote. After analyzing the information from multiple sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system should be retained for the following reasons.

Firstly, the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College is crucial in ensuring a smooth and clear election process. While disputes over the outcome of electoral votes are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is mainly because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. Moreover, the winner-take-all method in most states creates a landslide victory for the candidate with even a slight plurality, minimizing the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who represents the interests of the entire nation. The requirement for a candidate to have trans-regional appeal ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming president and neglecting the interests of other regions. It fosters a sense of inclusivity and avoids the perception of disenfranchisement among voters in states with fewer electoral votes.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states incentivizes candidates to campaign extensively in those states. This means that voters in swing states have a greater chance of engaging with and critically evaluating the different candidates. These voters are likely to be the most informed and thoughtful, making them the ideal group to decide the outcome of the election. By directing campaign efforts towards swing states, the Electoral College system promotes a more informed electorate.

In addition, the Electoral College balances the political importance of large and small states. While large states may lose some weight in the political balance due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, the Electoral College system ensures that candidates pay attention to and campaign in all states, regardless of their size. Small states are not marginalized, as victories with even a small margin in those states still contribute to the overall electoral vote count, giving them a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. By invariably producing a clear winner, it ensures a decisive outcome that avoids prolonged election disputes or the need for additional rounds of voting. This streamlines the process and provides stability in electing the president.

While some argue against the Electoral College, claiming it is unfair, outdated, and irrational, the practical reasons to retain it far outweigh these assertions. The current system has been effective in ensuring certainty, broader representation, informed voting, fair political balance, and avoiding run-off elections. These benefits are vital in maintaining a functioning democratic process in the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments for and against the Electoral College system before making any decisions. It is my hope that you will support the continuation of this vital process that has served our democracy well for over two centuries.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational and should be modified and updated so it is more fair to voters and the rest of the citizens.

The Founding Fathers created it during the Constitution as a compromise. This meaning it was made and designed for when it was needed. It did help the way presidents were voted for then,but its not suited for the population and other ways it has changed and is different in this time period. Over 60% of voters would prefer a new and direct election rather than the system that we have now.

Under the Electoral College we the people vote for electors, anyone not holding public office, who are chosen depending of the state by either state conventions, state party's central committee, or presidential candidates themselves. While voters are supposed to control who the electer votes for, sometimes they can make a mistake and vote for the wrong candidate. Its not very often that mistakes like these happen, but they do occur. If a mistake like this was to happen the wrong candidate would be voted for that the people didn't choose, resulting in the possibility that a candidate we didnt vote for could and has the possibility if winning.

Something similar to this that happened back in 1960 was the biggest election crisis of the century. Segregationists, who favored separation based on race, in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so the popular vote would not have been given to Kennedy and he would noyhave won.

In defense of the Electoral College it was very helpful when it was needed at first, but now it's in the wrong time period. It exceeded Obama's share of the popular vote when he received a 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney in 2012.

In conclusion the Electoral College should beb changed so we have a new and improved way for the people to vote fairly for who they want.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. This is evident in various examples from different countries around the world. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have embraced a car-free lifestyle, with 70% of families choosing not to own cars. This has resulted in a more relaxed and happier community, as residents no longer have to deal with the stress and tension that comes with car ownership. Additionally, limiting car usage is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is a major concern in Europe and the United States.

Private cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and car-intensive areas in the United States. By separating suburban life from auto use, smart planning initiatives aim to reduce this environmental impact. Vauban serves as an example of this approach, with its car-free streets and limited parking spaces. This model is being adopted in various countries to make suburbs more accessible to public transportation and reduce the reliance on cars. By placing stores within walking distance and creating a more compact community, the need for cars is minimized.

The United States is also starting to recognize the need for car-reduced communities. The Environmental Protection Agency is actively promoting this concept, and legislators are taking small steps towards making suburbs less car-dependent. Public transport is expected to play a larger role in future transportation bills. In past bills, the majority of funds were allocated to highways, but there is a growing understanding of the need to invest in alternative modes of transportation.

The success of these initiatives can be seen internationally as well. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. Congestion decreased by 60% during the ban, demonstrating the impact that limiting car usage can have on air pollution. Similarly, Bogota in Colombia has implemented a car-free day, which has been successful in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. The event has even inspired other cities and countries to adopt similar initiatives.

The decrease in car usage in the United States is evident in recent studies, which suggest that Americans are driving fewer miles and buying fewer cars. This shift in behavior is not just a result of the recession but appears to be a long-term trend. Factors such as the internet allowing for telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of car-pooling apps have all contributed to a decrease in car dependency. This cultural shift, if it continues, will have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, although it may pose challenges for the car industry.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing stress, improving air quality, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The examples from German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the success of car-free initiatives in creating more sustainable and livable communities. Additionally, the decrease in car usage in the United States indicates a cultural shift towards alternative forms of transportation. It is important for individuals and communities to embrace this change and continue working towards a future with reduced car dependence.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can combat the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall quality of life.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the roads, we can effectively decrease these emissions and mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change. This is especially important considering the increasing number of private cars owned by the middle class in developing countries, which are contributing to the pollution of cities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passages explain how new approaches to suburban planning, such as in the German suburb of Vauban, involve placing stores within walking distance rather than on distant highways. This not only encourages residents to rely less on cars, but also promotes healthier and more sustainable living. Additionally, these developments often prioritize public transportation and have limited parking spaces, making it more convenient for people to use alternative modes of transportation.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life for individuals. The passage describes how residents of Vauban, Germany, who have given up their cars, report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can be a source of tension and anxiety, whereas other modes of transportation, such as biking or walking, can be more enjoyable and relaxing. Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to less congestion on roads, resulting in faster and more efficient travel for everyone.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages for society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall well-being of individuals. By implementing smart planning strategies, such as those seen in Vauban, Germany, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can work towards a future with less reliance on cars and a more sustainable and livable environment.",1
"Cars, they make life so much easier, or, do they make them deadlier? The amount of green house gasses has increased dramaticly over the past years, due to the gasses emitted through the tallpipes of cars. However, there has been ways that people are trying to lower these gasses. People around the world are reducing the use of cars for a more cleaner form of transportation. In Vauban, Germany residents in this community ""have given up their cars""1. Also in Paris where they ""enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air""10. While in Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog""20. These cities are pioneers in the way of a cleaner form of travel.

The first step is to just have a day without cars, like a new holiday. In Bogota, thats just what they have. On this day ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work""20, and those who didn't were fined. This reduces not only smog but the stress of driving and the business of traffic jams. On one of these carfree days, even though it was raining the spirits of the people didn't dampen. Enrique rivera, the mayor of Asuncin, Paraguay, said ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and that it is crossing borders""26, when he visited Bogota. As a result of these days ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restraints and upscale shopping districts have cropped up""28.

Another way that the carfree idea is shaking up is in Paris, France. On a Monday ""motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home""11, if they didnt they would recieve a 22euro fine. There smog riviled Beijing, ""known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""14. however, after only one day, ""the smog cleared enough on Monday that the ruling French party rescinded the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday""19.

The biggest leap, however, would be a town with no cars. Vauban, Germany is a community where ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden""2. The streets are filled with ""the swish of bicyles and the chatter of wandering children""3 instead of motors and horns. This expirimental town has sparked a new way of life a cleaner, safer way of life.

We have gone on thousands of years without cars, and after they were introduced they polluted the air and caused us stress. So if we could go on without them before, then why can't we now. As demostraighted by Paris, Bogota and Vauban life isn't that bad without a wheel to sit behind.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system currently in place for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained due to its crucial role in maintaining a fair and balanced election process.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a minimum requirement of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of representatives it has in Congress. This system ensures that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a say in the election and prevents larger states from dominating the process (Office of the Federal Register).

Contrary to popular belief, the Electoral College rarely results in the winner of the popular vote losing the presidency. In fact, since 1888, this has only occurred once in the 2000 election (Posner, Judge Richard A). This demonstrates that the current system maintains the principle of majority rule while also providing a stable and reliable outcome. Additionally, the Electoral College has been successful in avoiding scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, thereby preventing the need for costly and time-consuming runoff elections (Posner, Judge Richard A).

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of the country by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Without this requirement, candidates could focus solely on regions where they have the most support, neglecting the interests and voices of other regions (Posner, Judge Richard A). This ensures that the President represents the diverse needs and concerns of the entire nation and not just specific regions.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is the emphasis it places on swing states. Under this system, candidates are incentivized to campaign in states that can swing the outcome of the election, leading to increased voter engagement and attention in these states (Posner, Judge Richard A). This means that swing state voters have a more significant influence on the election, encouraging candidates to address their concerns and issues. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus only on densely populated areas, leaving the majority of states with little to no attention during the campaign.

Lastly, the Electoral College provides smaller states with a fair share of attention during presidential campaigns. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even small states can play a crucial role in the final outcome of the election (Posner, Judge Richard A). It ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on winning the popular vote in large states to secure victory, giving smaller states a voice and influence in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system and should be retained. It maintains the principles of representation, regional balance, and majority rule while preventing scenarios of no majority and ensuring all states have an equal say. Changing to a popular vote system would ignore these advantages and potentially lead to unintentional consequences that could compromise the integrity of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and the reasons why it should be preserved for future presidential elections. I trust that you will make the right decision in the best interest of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers werenot always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electoral confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guaranteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the electoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candidates focus more on those states to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

"Cars are the main cause of pollution in major cities. Cities are covered in smog from gas emmisions from a car's exhaust. This is not good for the environment. Something must be done about this. If the usage of cars is cut down, then the amount of pollution in the air will be less. A less usage of cars allows people to have a clean community and helps the environment.

In Germany, there is a small community that is completely carfree. This community, Vauban, has about 5,500 residents, and not a single one of them use a car. This community is very clean and all of the people that live there are happy. Just think, what if every family in Vauban had a car? It would completely change this happy, clean community. There would be a lot more pollution and more stressful citizens. More and more small towns are beginning to ditch the cars for walking and taking a bicycle.

More cities are starting to have carfree days to help with the pollution problems that are causedby automobile engines. Examples of these cities include Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia. Pollution is starting to be a big problem in big cities like these, so they have decided to take action. Pollution is destroying our atmosphere. The gases that are released from the exhaust of car engines slowly deteriorates the layer of atmosphere of our world.If cars begin to be frequently used like they are now, the atmosphere may become damaged beyond the condition for being fixed. Earth only has one atmosphere, so once it's gone, we can't get it back.

People in the United States are beginning to cut back on the number of people who drive cars. The U.S. has been one of the leading country with the number of people who drive cars and the amount of pollution, but people have been taking action and going for a greener alternative. In the fourth passage it says, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."" A lot of people between 16 and 39 do not even have a driver's license. People are starting to take public transportation and carpool instead of driving their vehicles from point A to point B. With more and more people doing this, it just lessens the amount of emmisions in the atmsophere more. America has passed it prime for driving because of the more and more who are taking action in making a change in the health of our world.

In conclusion, there are many reasons that we should start to lessen the amount of people driving on the road. It just causes pollution and makes the health and well being of others and the earth worse. People are already beginning to make a change, but we need more than there is to make a difference.",0

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the importance of its preservation in our democratic system. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote method for electing the President of the United States, I believe that the Electoral College provides crucial benefits that would be lost in such a change.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes, even though he won only 51.3% of the popular vote. This discrepancy highlights the importance of the Electoral College in preventing disputes over close elections. With the winner-take-all system in most states, even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system guarantees a clear victor and helps maintain stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of our country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which incentivizes candidates to campaign in various states and engage with a diverse range of voters. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president will represent the interests and concerns of citizens from different regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and helps create a more united and balanced outcome.

Thirdly, the focus on swing states in a winner-take-all system encourages candidates to listen to voters and address their concerns more effectively. Voters in these states become highly engaged and informed, as they play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the election. This leads to a more thoughtful electorate, ensuring that the most informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can disadvantage large states, the Electoral College gives them more attention during campaigns. A candidate's victory in a large state like Florida will result in a higher number of electoral votes compared to a victory in a less populous state like Wyoming. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on densely populated areas and consider the concerns of citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner. This avoids the complications and delays that would arise if no candidate were to receive a majority of the votes. The certainty offered by the Electoral College allows for a smooth and efficient election process.

While some argue that a popular vote method would be fairer or more democratic, it is important to consider the practical benefits that the Electoral College provides. It ensures certainty, promotes the representation of all regions, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial element of our democratic system. Its preservation is vital to maintain stability, representation, and balance in our elections. I urge you to strongly consider these points when making decisions regarding potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the information provided and make an informed decision that best serves our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and a passionate advocate for our democratic principles, I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the many benefits it provides to our electoral process.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a popular vote and through a vote in Congress. Its purpose is to ensure that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a voice in the selection of the President. This is vital to maintain a fair and balanced representation of our diverse nation.

There are several compelling reasons why the Electoral College should be maintained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome it provides is invaluable. While disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are far less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, making the results clear and definitive. This avoids the uncertainty and potential chaos that could arise from a disputed popular vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is the choice of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous regions. The requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal encourages candidates to campaign across the country and consider the interests of all regions. This prevents a situation where a candidate with only regional appeal is elected, leading to disenfranchisement and a lack of representation for vast portions of our population.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This ensures that these states, which often represent diverse demographics and perspectives, receive the attention and consideration they deserve. It also motivates voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign and make more informed decisions, resulting in a more engaged electorate overall.

Additionally, the Electoral College rebalances the political weight of large and small states. While the mal-apportionment in the Senate already gives smaller states a stronger voice in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of voters in more populous states. This prevents the dominance of only a few densely populated states in determining the outcome of the election and ensures that candidates address the needs of a broad range of constituents.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. This saves time, resources, and effort that would be required if no candidate received a majority of the popular vote. The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, thereby providing stability and certainty in our electoral process.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair and outdated. However, it is important to consider the practical reasons for its retention, rather than basing our judgment solely on theoretical principles. In a diverse and geographically vast country like ours, the Electoral College ensures that every state and its citizens are part of the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system, providing certainty, trans-regional appeal, balance, and stability in our presidential elections. I respectfully request that you continue to support and defend the Electoral College, ensuring that the voices of all our citizens are heard and represented.

Thank you for your time and dedication to serving our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Many of us are used to getting somewhere by simply using a car, but should we always use a car. If we limit car usage we can solve most of our problems. We can save comically and collect less polution In source one the German Suburbs are car free, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden generally. Car ownership is allowed, however where a carowner buys space for their car has to pay near 40,000, along with a home. As a result according to source one 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars , and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Many citizens complain when the gas prices go up, but if we limit our car usage we wont have to complain anymore. We will save money, because when we decrease the usage of cars we wont use as much gas or diesel. Heidrun Walter told Elisabeth Rosenthal that he now lives happier this way. Not only do we save money but we also relieve tension through out our bodies.

However we may not enjoy this new idea of limiting car usage some of us actually enjoy driving but, there are days where after a long day of working the last thing you want to be in is in traffic jams.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman named, Carlos Arturo Plaza who rides a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In other ways that limiting car usage could help us is by eliminating pollution, of course everyone enjoys breathing in fresh air. By limiting car usage we can help lower polution. According to source two,"" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" the usage of car produced so much smog that they had to ban driving. Many of use drive to so many places that are near by that in reality we dont really have to use our car not only will we reduce pollution, but we will also maintain ourselves fit by using different alternatives like, walking, running, ridding our bikes. Although some may say, "" what if its an emergency,"" its fine we're only limiting car usage, we aren't goining to ban it forever.

If we limit car usage we can not only save money, but we can also reduce polution, and have a better lifestyle. Although these aren't the only ways limiting car usage can benefit us.",0
"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps reduce smog in the cities. In the article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", the author, Robert Duffer, talks about France banned driving in order to clean the polluted air. According to the text, "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"". Here it is evident that Paris has major pollution problems. Most of the vehicles in Paris have diesel fuel rather than gasoline, in which they favor due to a tax policy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party"". This clearly shows us that the ban on driving in Paris had an advantage in keeping a clean air.

Not only will limiting car usage will maintain an polluted air for us to breathe, but it will decrease traffic jams. In the article, ""CarFree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, a program is to ""promote alternative transportation"". Selsky writes, ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"". This tells the reader that this has positive impact on the city.

Limiting car usage could save time, improve safety, and conserve resources. According to the article, ""The End Of Car Culture"", the author mentions how her children live in places in which driving a car would be useful, however its not their priority because they ""organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends"". Although they could have gotten their own license to drive, it would have been a waste of money and time when there is always an available and less cost transportation.

Limiting car usage indeed does have advantages. The limiting of our car usage has positive effect on our enviroment by the reducing of smog, the decrease in traffic jams, conserves our resources and time, and also improves our safety.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Car usage has become deeply ingrained in our society, but there are growing movements around the world that are promoting the idea of limiting car usage for a variety of reasons. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can have a positive impact on the environment, improve public health, and create more livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for up to 50 percent of emissions in some areas of the United States. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, and cycling, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

In European countries like Germany and France, efforts have been made to create car-free communities. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has successfully implemented a car-free policy, with only limited parking spaces available at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move into the community. Residents have reported feeling less stressed and happier without the burden of car ownership.

These car-free developments are part of a larger movement called ""smart planning,"" which aims to separate suburban life from auto use. The idea is to create more compact communities with better access to public transportation and amenities within walking distance. This approach not only reduces reliance on cars, but also creates more vibrant and livable neighborhoods.

Limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on public health. The smog problem in cities like Paris has led to partial driving bans, with restrictions on cars based on license plate numbers. During these driving bans, congestion decreased significantly, and levels of particulate matter in the air were reduced. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with pollution.

In addition, reducing car usage can improve physical activity levels. By walking or cycling instead of driving, individuals can incorporate exercise into their daily routines, leading to better health outcomes. Car-free initiatives, such as the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, have been successful in encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation and showcase the benefits of car-free lifestyles.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote physical activity. By creating car-free communities and implementing policies that support alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is time to reevaluate our dependence on cars and embrace new ways of getting around that are better for both our environment and our well-being.",1
"The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, ""When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government."" After viewing the articles Source 1:""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3:""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter. To further empower the citizens of the United States the Electoral Colleges should be abolished.

Throughout our nations history the majority vote has lost due to being outvoted when it comes to Electoral Colleges. Because of the majority vote losing out to Electoral Colleges, people have come to believe their vote will not matter in the long run. In Source 2 Plumer declares, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate"". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their candidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the candidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, ""Most states have a 'winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one candidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented.

Electoral Colleges do not reflect the democratic style of government we have had for hundreds of years. In Source 3 Posner states, ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"". Ever since the United States has been around our lifestyle has been purely democratic. The people are supposed to the empowering body of our government and their voice is the one that should be heard. But since we have the Electoral College the voice of the people has become muffled. No longer is the presidential election a democratic event, but one that is decided through the votes of only a few chosen American citizens. Plumer observed in Source 2 that, ""During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all"". If the people of America are truly part of our governing body then they must see the candidates and hear what they have to say. The Electoral College has driven candidates away from states that will not have much say. These states are then left to make a decision for themselves and decide based on their personal preference, they are never able to truly hear what these candidates may or may not have to offer.

On the other hand, Electoral Colleges do have a lack of uncertainty. As Posner said in Source 3, ""the dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likey than a dispute over the popular vote"". The Electoral College provides the American people with a certainty of outcome. Whenever a state decides where its Electoral votes are going the candidate typically wins by a landslide electoralvote victory.

Although the Electoral College has a few appealing qualities, it is mostly an unfair system for the United States. The colleges should not have the power to decide the president, that should be the people that reside in the country's choice. Thomas Jefferson spoke of the people taking control of their country's government and the citizens of America should do just that if they are ever to escape the grasp of the Electoral Colleges.",0
"As society becomes more aware of the impact of cars on the environment, there is a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This movement is gaining traction in various parts of the world and comes with numerous advantages. By limiting car usage, we can not only reduce our carbon footprint but also improve the overall quality of life in our communities.

One example of a community that has successfully limited car usage is Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, except for a few streets and large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This has led to happier residents, less pollution, and a more peaceful and bike-friendly neighborhood. The success of Vauban has inspired similar initiatives in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Reducing car usage is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. This is especially important as we work towards meeting ambitious goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions, such as those set by President Obama.

Limiting car usage also has positive implications for our environment. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help decrease air pollution and improve air quality. This is especially important in cities like Paris, where smog reaches dangerous levels. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air, and congestion was reduced by 60 percent. Similar initiatives, such as car-free days, have been successful in cities like Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, or took buses to work. These car-free initiatives not only reduce emissions but also promote alternative transportation and create a sense of community.

By limiting car usage, we can also improve the overall quality of life in our communities. In Vauban, residents have experienced less stress and greater happiness since giving up their cars. In addition, limiting car usage allows for smarter urban planning. Instead of sprawling suburbs and distant malls that rely heavily on cars, communities can be designed with stores placed a walk away, accessible public transportation, and less space for parking. This makes it easier to run errands, encourages physical activity, and reduces traffic congestion. Furthermore, limiting car usage can help revitalize city centers and make suburbs more compact and accessible. This has been seen in Bogota, where the construction of bicycle paths, parks, and sports centers, along with rush-hour restrictions, has transformed the city for the better.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life in our communities. Initiatives like car-free days, car-reduced communities, and smart urban planning are gaining momentum around the world. As more people become aware of the benefits and take action to limit car usage, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Some people believe that the electoral college should be abolished and some people believe that the electoral college has helped us throughout the years. But I believe that electoral college should be abolished.

The reason I believe that the electoral college should be abolished is because I don't believe it is benefiting any elections at all. And a lot of people do not believe in it either. In source two Bradford Plumer said ""what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce been trying to do, abolish electoral voting."" I think that the electoral college makes the president elections to close to tie, and that could be a catastrophe. However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that "" if there was no electoral college there would be no winnertakeall system."" this would a terrible problem for the candidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.

Therefore sources two and three makes some pretty valuable and good points, but I still think source two makes more sense to me. In source three Richard A. Posner wrote "" it is the electors who elect the president not the voters. When your voting for a president candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. I dont agree that electors decide what we voted for, because then whats the point of voting for a candidate if your not even choosing at all. America is a democracy and having someone choose your president for you is not showing that we live in a democratic nation. We need to choose so we can learn from our own mistakes and then we won't make them again.

This just shows that the House Of representatives and the government don't trust us at all and that we cant make good decisions. Source one doesnt say anything about being against or with it but it did point out some interesting facts about the electoral college. The office of the federal register wrote "" the electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What their saying is that we might not have huge say on the election but we do have a pretty big say on it. I don't that we have any say on it what so ever, and that is because of the slate of electors.

In conclusion, I agree with what source two had to say because of the great points they made and the facts that led me to belive that the electoral college does not work at all. Read the sources and then tell me if you think i'm right or wrong.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improvements in air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable and efficient transportation systems.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with some areas reporting up to 50 percent of emissions coming from cars. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, and biking, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. In the passage about Paris, a driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog caused by car emissions. The results were significant, with congestion decreasing by 60 percent and particulate matter levels dropping compared to other European cities. This demonstrates how reducing car usage can have immediate benefits for public health and the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of more sustainable and efficient transportation systems. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota highlights the success of a program that encourages alternative transportation options, such as hiking, biking, skating, and public transit. This not only reduces reliance on cars, but also creates a more connected and accessible urban environment. In addition, the passage about Vauban, Germany, shows how smart planning and car-free neighborhoods can promote a more compact and walkable lifestyle, with stores located on main streets rather than distant malls.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Vauban reveals that 70 percent of families in this community do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This suggests that limiting car usage can result in cost savings for individuals, as they no longer have to bear the expenses associated with car ownership and maintenance. It can also lead to economic opportunities, as the passage mentions how delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the driving ban in Paris, indicating a potential shift towards alternative modes of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, more sustainable transportation systems, and potential cost savings. The passages provided highlight various examples from around the world that demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage. By adopting similar approaches and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can work towards a more sustainable and efficient future.",1
"Cars are benefits for getting you from point A to point B, but there are many other ways you can receive transportation that way. Cars can also get you there quicker, but its not worth what we are doing to our environment and ourselves. There are three major advantages about limiting your car use. It will help out our environment with the air pollution you can hear the peacefulness of birds and kids playing, and its a financial rest.

First and foremost, it will help out with our air pollution. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...""14. The gas we use to fuel up our vehicles is polluting the environment when we use it. If we used Paris as an example, we can have odd and even driving days for odd and even license plates 11. That means only half the people with cars would be driving on the road each day which could alter the air pollution. Another reliable example is Bogota, once a year they have a car free day to limit the air pollution 20. Carlos Arturo Plaza believes, ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" 24.

In addition, the neighborhood or city you are in wouldn't be as loud. Have you ever imagined a peaceful environment with no car horns or engine? Heidrun Walter said she was always tense and now she is happy without her car, because she can hear the swiss of bicycles and the chatterring of children playing 3. Rarely do I ever have peaceful moments unless I'm inside school, or at the neighborhood library. For example, a peaceful walk to school can mentally prepare me for my day ahead, and save my mother gas money.

The amount of money one pays for a car could be equilvalent to amount some else pays for their house. Also, when you get the car, you have to put gas in it for your engine to power up. Limited car use wouldn't just effect you as a person, but the economy as a whole. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" 9. If we reduced our car usage, the United States wouldn't have to spend 80 percent of appropriations to highways and they could even it out more to other transportation use. Plus, if you didn't have to pay for gas every week just imagine how much money that would save you.

Limited car use doesn't just effect you financially, but it also contributes positively to the environment. In additon, more peaceful moments can be added to your agenda of things to do. Cars are reliable for their speed and transportation, but when it comes to long term effects, I don't know if its really worth the risk.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can offer numerous advantages to both individuals and society as a whole. This idea is gaining momentum around the world, with cities like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota leading the way in promoting car-free or car-reduced living. By reducing car usage, we can mitigate the negative impact of cars on the environment, improve public health, and create more livable and accessible communities.

One of the most compelling reasons to limit car usage is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. According to a study cited in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some parts of the United States. By reducing reliance on cars, we can significantly decrease these emissions and move towards a more sustainable future. This is particularly important in suburban areas, where cars are central to daily life. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, is an excellent example of how limiting car usage can contribute to reducing emissions.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. The smog problem in Paris, as described in Robert Duffer's article, highlights the detrimental impact of car emissions on air quality. By implementing driving bans and promoting alternative transportation, cities like Paris can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with pollution. Furthermore, encouraging people to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving can promote physical activity and lead to a healthier population.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to more livable and accessible communities. By designing neighborhoods with less space for parking and more public transportation options, as exemplified by Vauban and Bogota, we can create environments that prioritize pedestrians and cyclists. Walking and cycling can become safer and more enjoyable activities when cars are restricted. Furthermore, by placing stores and services within walking distance, we can reduce the need for long-distance driving and bolster local economies. This new approach to planning can transform suburban areas into vibrant and connected communities.

However, it is important to acknowledge that limiting car usage may pose challenges, especially in areas heavily reliant on the car culture. Resistance from car owners, inconvenience, and concerns over job loss in the automobile industry are all valid concerns. However, as Elisabeth Rosenthal's article states, there is evidence of a cultural shift happening, demonstrated by a decrease in car ownership and driving among young people in the United States. These shifts may be driven by factors such as the rise of telecommuting, improved public transportation options, and changing attitudes towards car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing emissions, improving public health, and creating more livable communities, we can move towards a more sustainable and healthier future. The examples set by cities like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate that it is possible to reimagine our urban landscapes and prioritize alternative forms of transportation. As we continue to face the challenges of climate change and urbanization, limiting car usage is a crucial step in creating a more sustainable and economically viable future.",1
"The Electoral College is the cause of many political disagreements and problems whenever mentioned. Although established in the constitution, it is seen as undemocratic by many. The Electoral College takes away the ability of citizens to vote for their president instead they are voting for Electors, not always loyal to the candidate. As a result, I believe the Electoral College should only be used in instances of a tie between two candidates.

Each presidential candidate has a group of Electors, which will be part of the Electoral College process after the popular vote is taken. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting in which the vote for both President and Vice President occurs, and then the votes are counted by Congress. Office of the Federal Registera When the popular vote occurs, and the candidates are selected, the votes are tallied, and then the electors of the two candidates attend the meeting, and then the final decision for President is made. This is viewed as undemocratic, because there have been instances where the Electoral College disagrees with the popular vote. Such as the case of Al Gore in 2000, who won the popular vote, and then lost the Electoral vote and therefore his presidency.Bradford Plumera This caused over 60 percent of voters, to wish for a direct election opposed to the electoral process, according to a gallop poll, also occurring in 2000. Bradford Plumera Anotherr issue within the electoral college, is the electors themselves. While they may claim to be loyal to their candidate, loyalties can be bribed, changed, or electors may even be replaced with only a certain party Republican or Democratic. Which occured in Louisiana in 1960. The segregationists almost replaced Democratic electors, with ones who would instead oppose Kennedy, as a sabotage attempt at Kennedy's Presidency.Bradford Plumera There have also been cases in which the loyalty of the elector was switched, and the citizens were seemingly forgotten at the electoral college. While there are over millions of people residing in the United States, there are only 538 Electors, and the fate of our country is put in Electors who can't be trusted.

Over 60 percent of Americans oppose the Electoral college, but there are still some which still believe in the compromise established by our founding fathers. The Electoral College provides a smaller chance of election ties, and an equal vote from each state. While a tie is possible in the popular voting system, it is also possible in the Electoral College, with 538 electors, 269 votes from each side can cause a huge dissagreement within our Legislative System, which could be avoided by using only the popular vote. When politicians and presidential candidates are looking for votes, they most commonly travel to the larger states, because of the larger population. A larger population provides an even larger chance of obtaining voters. But, this leaves the small states with no attention from candidates, and a smaller population weakens the states chance of the candidate they desire. Every vote counts for a candidate,5,559 voters from Ohio, and 3,687 from Hawaii stopped a tie by voting. Bradford Plumera Even the small states contribute in a presidential elections, their votes are just as big as ours, even if their states ae small.

The founding fathers formed the Electoral College as a compromise, and hundreds of years later, I believe it is time for a compromise once again. The popular vote, should become the deciding vote for who is elected as President, Vice President, etc. With this, the chance of a tie comes, so i propose that the Electoral College remain only for the purpose of a tie in the popular vote, or if state legislature has reason to believe this candidate is not the best for America.

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation in the electoral process for the president of the United States. While I acknowledge the arguments put forth by those who argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several key advantages that should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-takes-all system also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding the need for run-off elections and potential complications in the election process.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal, as stated by Judge Posner. This means that candidates must have support across multiple regions of the country in order to secure the necessary electoral votes to win the presidency. This discourages candidates with only regional appeal and promotes the idea of a president who represents the entire nation. It prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous states or specific regions and encourages them to engage with a diverse range of voters across the country.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and engage with the candidates. This ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a significant impact on the election outcome. In a popular vote system, candidates may prioritize campaigning only in densely populated areas and neglect the concerns and interests of voters in less populous regions.

The Electoral College also balances the political power of large and small states. By allocating electoral votes based on each state's representation in Congress, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political influence of larger states, which can be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on the support of a few heavily populated states and must pay attention to a larger range of states in their campaign efforts. This promotes a more balanced and representative approach to campaigning and governance.

Lastly, the argument that the Electoral College discourages voters in states that are not competitive is flawed. As argued by Judge Posner, voters in presidential elections are primarily people who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe that their single vote will decide the outcome. Even if their vote is unlikely to impact the election outcome in their state, voters still have the opportunity to voice their political preferences and participate in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while imperfect, offers several advantages in the election of the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates with trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement with swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages outweigh the arguments presented by those who advocate for a popular vote system. I implore you to consider these points and support the preservation of the Electoral College in our electoral process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passage set provides examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to reduce car dependency and promote alternative modes of transportation. These examples highlight some key benefits of limiting car usage, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased physical activity.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, communities can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. For example, the German suburb of Vauban has seen a decrease in car ownership, with 57 percent of families selling their cars to move there. This has resulted in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the area. Similarly, the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, aims to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, thereby decreasing the city's overall carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. The passage set mentions the smog problem in Paris and how it led to a driving ban in the city. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This highlights how limiting car usage can directly improve the health and well-being of citizens by reducing air pollution. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transportation, communities can contribute to cleaner air and a healthier living environment.

Limiting car usage can also have positive impacts on physical activity. The passage set mentions how suburbs like Vauban are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation, with stores located within walking distance. By creating communities that are more walkable and bike-friendly, individuals are encouraged to engage in physical activity as part of their daily routines. This can have numerous health benefits, such as reduced obesity rates and improved cardiovascular health.

Overall, limiting car usage can have wide-ranging advantages for both individuals and society. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting physical activity, communities can create healthier and more sustainable environments. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing measures to promote alternative modes of transportation. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"Limiting car usage can have significant advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various case studies and studies conducted in different parts of the world. By reducing car usage, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and foster a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

One significant advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By using cars less frequently, individuals can contribute to reducing these emissions and helping mitigate climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage about Paris' driving ban due to smog illustrates this point. The smog in Paris rivaled that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By implementing car-free days and limiting car usage, cities can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for their residents.

Furthermore, reducing car usage can have positive effects on public health. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban highlights this benefit. In Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents report feeling less stressed and happier without cars. This is supported by studies that have shown the negative impact of traffic congestion and long commutes on mental health. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transport, people can lead healthier and more active lifestyles.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of sustainable and efficient transportation systems. The passage on the Colombian car-free day demonstrates this. In Bogota, millions of Colombians left their cars at home and used alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, skating, or taking buses. This not only reduces congestion and traffic jams but also encourages the development of infrastructure to support these alternative modes of transportation. This can include the construction of bike lanes, better sidewalks, and improved public transport systems, making cities more accessible and livable for everyone.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and promote sustainable and efficient transportation systems. The case studies and studies discussed in the passages provide evidence of these benefits. It is crucial for individuals and society as a whole to consider the advantages of limiting car usage and actively work towards implementing measures to achieve these benefits.",1
"A life filled to the brim of better days is what we all want, and limiting car usage has some of these advantages. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter. The sound of children outside of the pollution free community is much more satisfying then getting somewhere with dangers involved. A life without cars is less stressful and more free to explore in safety. Driving tends to make drivers uneasy for fear or crash or being late to work from traffic.

""Mr. Sivak's son lives in San Francisco and has a car but takes Bay Area Rapid Transit, when he can, even though that often takes longer than driving."" Clearly being late to work and stressed is not something people favor epically when getting to work for free is possible. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" Instead of spending thousands of dollars expecting an easier lifestyle your neck rests on the chopping block with the blade ever silently above until it completes is mission. Having this ability feels like freedom but it's actually just a fear inducing, death causing machine. A simple healthier life on a bike seems more enjoyable, and even more so when it promotes good health and your life.

""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Not one person can really enjoy a twenty or forty minute drive to a mall or anywhere for that matter. It's a waste of time, money, and life. Taking a 5 minute walk to a mall is much more beneficial to your body and health than adding gas to your lungs, and it's quicker too. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Children playing outside instead of inside on their new tablet could be our future again. Parents don't have enough time to spend thirty minutes driving to a park when their child seems content on their fancy iPhone 6. Shopping is also a favorite anywhere, but it seems to be drifting online. Taking five minutes to walk to the mall and save money on not buying a car or spending money on shipping will give more money to buy stuff! A bonus is no more wrong clothing sizes or ordering a lotion that smells like toilet water. Ease of lifestyle is a desire that can be fulfilled when waving goodbye to miles of road and hello to a new jeans that fit for once.

Pollution is a horrible topic that everyone wants to stop, however everyone is ignoring one of its sources. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" It sounds like Earth is becoming like the movie WallE, and next stop is a ship in space leaving this trashed planet behind. Paris is setting a great example at trying to remove pollution for healthier living and a better environment. The United States has clearly been challanged and in its effort to be the best it followed suit, ""...It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the evironment."" It is hard to imagine a healthy ecosystem with flourishing plant and animal life in our current situation. With Paris and the United States assisting in the idea of other transpot methods not only will animals have a better chance at not becoming extinct but so will the human race. Dying of pollution will no longer be a concern and money spent on poison can go to lifes other pleasures.

Happiness, fast travel, no pollution, and more new stuff sounds like owning a car right? Carlos Arturo has a taste of the sweet life, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Sadly this is not what a car provides because in fact it only reverses these good things. Despair sets in with forty minutes waiting in traffic while clouds of gray swirl into the sky returning a shirt that didn't fit. Reconsidering the advantages of having a car and considering the advantages of limiting car usage is the right way to live a perfect life.",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system in place for the election of the President of the United States. While there have been calls to abolish this system in favor of a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College has several important advantages that should be considered.

First, the Electoral College ensures a certain outcome in the election process. As we have seen in the past, a dispute over the popular vote can lead to uncertainty and even a crisis. However, because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, the likelihood of such a dispute is reduced. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely due to the way electoral votes are awarded on a winner-take-all basis in most states.

Second, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to voters across different regions. This is important because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The Electoral College ensures that the interests and concerns of voters from multiple regions are taken into account.

Third, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states are the ones where the outcome of the election is uncertain, and therefore receive significant attention from candidates. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the opportunity to decide the election.

Fourth, the Electoral College gives some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a campaign, candidates are more likely to give attention to large states because they have more electoral votes. This balances out the political influence of larger and smaller states and ensures that the interests of all states are taken into account.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College is able to produce a clear winner. This helps to avoid a complicated election process and ensures that the president has a majority mandate.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns about voters feeling that their votes do not count, it is important to note that no single voter's vote swings a national election. The Electoral College system still encourages political participation and the expression of political preferences.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has several practical advantages that should be considered. It ensures a certain outcome, encourages candidates with trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, gives weight to large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These benefits contribute to the stability and fairness of the presidential election process. Therefore, I urge you to maintain the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is a growing trend in many parts of the world as cities and communities recognize the benefits of reducing dependency on cars. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the ideas and information provided in the passages. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, communities can improve their quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Quality of Life
One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Passage 2). Residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and more relaxed (Passage 3). By reducing traffic congestion and noise levels, communities that limit car usage create a more peaceful and quiet environment. Additionally, walking and biking become more common, leading to improved physical health and well-being.

Body Paragraph 2: Environmental Benefits
Limiting car usage also has a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Passage 5). By decreasing reliance on cars, communities can help combat climate change and improve air quality, making them healthier and more sustainable for future generations. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during periods of high pollution, resulting in a significant drop in congestion and smog (Passage 14). Similar initiatives in Bogota, Colombia, have led to a car-free day, reducing traffic and promoting alternative transportation (Passage 21).

Body Paragraph 3: Efficient Land Use and Accessibility
By limiting car usage, communities can utilize their land more efficiently and create better accessibility. Vauban, for example, places stores within walking distance on the main street, reducing the need for malls along distant highways (Passage 6). This approach encourages people to walk or bike to nearby amenities, promoting a sense of community and reducing the need for excessive parking spaces. Additionally, this shift towards smart planning allows for the development of compact neighborhoods, making public transportation more accessible and reducing the dependence on private cars (Passage 6).

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages for communities. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, cities and suburbs can improve their residents' quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments. With initiatives like car-free days and the promotion of public transportation, we can work towards a future where cars are no longer the linchpin of suburbs. It is essential for communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and prioritize the implementation of sustainable transportation solutions.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly evident in both developed and developing countries. Several cities and communities around the world have adopted measures to separate suburban life from auto use, and the positive effects are already being seen.

Reducing car usage has significant environmental benefits. Automobiles are responsible for a considerable portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are accountable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can reach up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and improving air quality.

Apart from environmental advantages, limiting car usage also enhances the quality of life for residents. Communities that have embraced car-free lifestyles have seen a decrease in traffic congestion, noise pollution, and accidents. Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has experienced a significant improvement in the well-being of its residents. Many families who have moved to Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. The absence of cars on the streets allows for safer and more enjoyable outdoor spaces, with pedestrians and cyclists becoming the dominant mode of transportation.

Additionally, limiting car usage also promotes the development of more accessible and sustainable cities. By creating communities with less space for parking and implementing smart planning initiatives, cities can encourage the use of public transportation and non-motorized modes of transport. Placing stores within walking or cycling distance, rather than sprawling malls along highways, allows for a more compact and connected urban environment. This not only reduces reliance on cars but also promotes an active and healthy lifestyle.

Several cities have already taken steps to limit car usage with encouraging results. Paris banned driving on certain days due to high smog levels, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion. Bogota, Colombia, introduced a car-free day, which has been successful in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog. In the United States, the government is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and there is an increasing focus on public transportation in federal transportation bills.

The shift towards limiting car usage is a positive development for both the environment and the well-being of individuals. It is essential for cities and communities around the world to adopt measures that promote alternative transportation options and reduce reliance on automobiles. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable, vibrant, and healthier future for all.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent in today's society. With concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and the negative impacts of car culture, many cities and communities are exploring alternative methods of transportation. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote healthier, more active lifestyles.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. In this suburb, cars are not allowed on the streets, except for the main thoroughfare and a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move to the area. The residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without the reliance on cars. This experiment in low-car suburban life in Vauban is just one example of the growing trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from auto use.

Reducing car usage also has environmental benefits. Automobiles are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. Limiting car usage can help reduce these emissions and combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also alleviate traffic congestion. In cities like Paris, temporary driving bans have been implemented during periods of intense smog. These bans have resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion, providing relief for residents and improving air quality. By encouraging alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, cities can reduce the number of cars on the road and alleviate traffic congestion.

In addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage promotes healthier lifestyles. With cars out of the picture, residents are more likely to engage in physical activity. Walking and cycling become the preferred modes of transportation, leading to improved fitness and overall health. Car-free communities like Vauban and events like the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage on public health.

Despite the challenges and cultural shift involved in limiting car usage, there are signs that suggest a long-term change is underway. Studies in the United States have shown a decrease in car ownership, fewer miles driven, and a decline in the percentage of young people obtaining their driver's licenses. This shift in behavior, combined with the rise of alternative transportation options and changes in urban design, points to the potential for a future with reduced reliance on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. From improved air quality and reduced congestion to promoting healthier lifestyles, the benefits of reducing car usage are significant. As we strive to address climate change and create more livable cities, it is essential to embrace alternative transportation methods and limit our dependence on cars. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent, I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method used to elect the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College continues to be the most effective and fair approach for a variety of reasons.

One of the primary reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the President has a clear mandate and legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. With each state having a certain number of electors, candidates are compelled to campaign in all states, including those with smaller populations. This prevents candidates from exclusively focusing on heavily populated urban areas and ensures that the concerns and interests of all Americans are taken into account.

In addition, the Electoral College serves to protect the interests of smaller states and less populated regions. It balances the weight that large states hold due to their representation in the House of Representatives, providing a fair voice to states with smaller populations. This helps to prevent the domination of the presidency by a few highly populated states, ensuring a more geographically diverse leadership.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to prevent run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, avoiding the need for costly and time-consuming run-offs. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined election process, ultimately benefiting the American people.

While some argue that the popular vote system would be more democratic, it is important to note that the Electoral College remains a representative process. When we cast our votes for a presidential candidate, we are actually voting for a slate of electors who will then make the final decision. This indirect method of selection allows for the consideration of regional interests and ensures that our democracy remains balanced and fair.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a stable and equitable method for electing the President. It creates certainty in the outcome, gives a voice to all regions of the country, protects the interests of smaller states, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a system that balances democracy and representation, ensuring that the President is elected in a way that is fair, legitimate, and reflective of the diverse interests of our nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College and vote in favor of maintaining this vital component of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in today's society. Not only does it contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also promotes healthier lifestyles and more efficient use of resources. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency.

One such example is Vauban, a car-free district in Germany. In this community, residents are not allowed to have street parking, driveways, or home garages, except for a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of them sold their cars to move there. The residents have noticed a significant improvement in their quality of life, with less stress and a greater sense of happiness. This suggests that reducing car usage can have positive effects on mental health and overall well-being.

Similar initiatives can be seen in other parts of the world, including Paris and Bogota. In response to high levels of pollution, Paris implemented a partial driving ban, where motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home on certain days. This led to a significant reduction in congestion and smog in the city, providing evidence that limiting car usage can have immediate and tangible benefits for the environment and public health.

In Bogota, Colombia, a program called Car-Free Day has been implemented for several years. On this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This initiative not only reduces pollution and congestion but also promotes alternative modes of transportation and healthier lifestyles. It has been so successful that other cities in Colombia have joined in, and municipal authorities from other countries have come to observe and learn from the event.

Furthermore, studies have shown that Americans are driving less and purchasing fewer cars. This shift in behavior can be attributed to various factors, including the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of alternative transportation options such as bike-sharing and car-sharing programs. This decrease in car ownership and driving not only benefits the environment but also has potential implications for the car industry, as companies are starting to rebrand themselves as mobility companies with a broader range of products and services.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various aspects of society. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting healthier lifestyles and more efficient use of resources, limiting car usage has a positive impact on both individuals and the environment. Initiatives such as car-free districts, driving bans, and programs like Car-Free Day are tangible examples of the benefits that can be achieved through reducing car dependency. By embracing these initiatives and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"The Electoral College is full of debates, but the biggest debate is if they should still have power. They should not stay in power because The United States of America is a democracy. Its is easier and more democratic if the candidate won by popular demand. What is a democracy good for if the Electoral college can change their choice of who becomes president. Many of the representatives in the Electoral College are unfair to voters and sometimes cheat the voting system. Would you want that running your countries choices? I dont think so.

The voters choose a candidate in the electoral college but they can always change their votes. For example, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" stated in source two. Basically, If you want a republican president to win you would vote for a republican representative of the electoral college, but thats not always the truth. Voters can not control the mind of a representative, in a few seconds they become of member of the opposing sides and thus they have your vote. This is known as unfair use of your vote that can obviously not be taken back.

2000 was the the year many people realized the lies of the electoral college. Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College states that ""Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This means that the electoral college is cheating the voting system and lying to their voters. So, do your votes even matter? No, not really. ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" said by Plumer. This system we have for voting is basically useless to us and just gives the electoral college more power to run us.

The Electoral College does have some good reasons its still in power. In source three written by Richard A. Posner, he states that ""... the pressure of the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" In other words, when there is a runoff election or tie, the electoral college brings down this pressure making the choice so its quicker to make a choice on who becomes president. Sadly, very few people find the Electoral College useful but they do do a lot of things that help make the elections easier on the voters and putting less pressure on the candidates.

In the past few years people have realized what the Electoral College actually does. Its is true to believe that they grab our vote and change it last minute. They also can help in the process of the presidential election, but they make the voters confused and get called unfair adn cheaters, which is true. If this country was truely a democracy then the people would have complete ownership on who becomes president not the Electoral College.",0
"For years, the United States has been mass producing and using cars. It may sound surprising, but America has already reached its peak when it comes to buying cars source 4. More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefits of using alternative means of transportation. Places such as Vauban, bogota, Paris, and even New York have implemented programs to encourage the limited use of cars. The idea of giving up such a comfort may sound tragic at first, but reducing car usage has many advantages.

We use cars everyday for pretty basic purposes. To get to work or school or to run errands are just a few examples. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a bus or ask for a ride from somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the past tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reasons. Maybe friends or family are not willing to give rides. Maybe the sheer thought of walking a mile may seem terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason is probably that having a car is just too covenant, it seems that there is no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and should be adjusted to fit into these sources of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their cars in favor of a life without them source 1. I just proves that contrary to popular belief, cars are actually not a necessity!

Citizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycles when they need to go someplace source 1. It's almost needless to say this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most carowners in the United States! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are these people in better physical shape, but one mother, Heidrum Walter, tells us that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now that she has given it up, she seems happier source 1. Carlos Arturo Plaza, in bogota, Columbia, says that using his bike on their annual nocar day reduces his stress levels. There is a direct corrolation between physical activity and mental wellbeing. The more activity, the better you feel. By limitting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that comes in place of it, making us a happier, healthier community.

Maybe the most important reason to reduce car usage is to protect our enviroment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuels, we are both running out of this resource and posing the threat of spills and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we use to fill our cars certainly won't last forever. It won't even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, spills can be devasting to the ecosystem it impacts, as we have seen in the past, for example the BP oil spill. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we use to fill our cars is the air pollution it leaves behind. Transportation is the second leading source of emissions in the US, behind power plants source 4. Also, in Paris, the smog from automobiles got to be so bad that they set laws to ban cars on certain days source 2. Just by reducing car usage for a few days, the smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn't be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they spend driving in their cars, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.

Over the years, we Americans have grown accustomed to relying on cars for our every need, but we can't do that anymore. As a community, we need to open our eyes and see the changes happening around us. Cars are not a necessity. We don't even need to completely get rid of them, but it is neccesary for us to cut back, for the sake of our health and our environment. It may take some getting used to, but I promise, it is more than possible. In the words of Bill Ford, we can soon move forward to a world where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve saftey."" source 4.",0
"The Electoral College, to begin with, is the electoral voting of the President and Vice President. In the articles ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, both articles argue on the subject of if the Electoral College should be kept or if the election should be changed to popular vote.

Although it is true, according to the article by Richard A. Posner, that larger states get the majority of attention when it comes to votes, it is still possible that regardless that the legislatures choose the electors, the electors may ""defy the will of the people"", according to the article by Bradford Plumer. It is stated that electors have declined the voting of their party's candidate and went on to ""vote for whomever they please...."" Furthermore, in the article by Bradford Plumer, Plumer states, ""the electoral college is unfair to voters."" In other words, the popular vote basically gets no say in who they are choosing for presidential candidate, only who gets to choose the candidate. Even as stated in the opposing article by Richard A. Posner, Posner states, ""the electoral will not win the national popular vote."" This is stating that basically the popular vote is powerless in voting for a presidential candidate.

Moreover, Posner explains in his article, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" However this has happened before where there has been more of a ""tie,"" Plumer backs this up quoting that ""In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" In short, if the Electoral College fails, they have Mommy and Daddy to back them up. In this case, the simpler route would be to have the election dependent upon popular vote.

In conclusion, it would appear as the electoral college is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational."" This goes to prove the electoral college has no place in deciding our votes for us.",0
"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro 31 U.S. dollar fine.

Bogota, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 carfree day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twentyfive dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definately see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars. These days have proven many of these claims that support the assertion that there are multiple advantages to limited car usage.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage in cities and suburbs can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. The articles ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal provide evidence and examples of the benefits of reducing car dependence.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, particularly in suburban areas, emissions can be greatly reduced. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in a significant decrease in emissions and a more environmentally-friendly community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. In the city of Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced in response to high levels of smog. The ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. Similar initiatives have been implemented in other cities, such as Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These examples demonstrate that by reducing car usage, cities can experience better air quality and a healthier environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the German suburb of Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This promotes a pedestrian-friendly environment and encourages people to walk or use public transportation instead of relying on cars. In addition, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion and the need for extensive parking spaces, allowing for more efficient land use and the development of other amenities, such as parks and sports centers. 

There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. In Paris, delivery companies complained of lost revenue due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that by promoting alternative transportation options, such as electric vehicles and carpooling, cities can support innovative industries and reduce reliance on traditional car usage.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, more compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. As cities and suburbs around the world implement initiatives to reduce car dependence, it becomes clear that these measures not only benefit individuals and the environment, but also lead to more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can improve their quality of life, protect the environment, and promote healthier lifestyles. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from various sources.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, emissions can be significantly reduced. Vauban, an experimental car-free community in Germany, serves as an example of how limiting car ownership can reduce environmental impact. As stated in Rosenthal's article, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move to this community. The absence of cars in Vauban leads to cleaner air and a healthier environment.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can have positive effects on public health. Andrew Selsky's article describes how millions of Colombians participate in a car-free day each year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This initiative not only reduces air pollution but also encourages physical activity such as hiking, biking, and skating. By limiting car usage, people are more likely to engage in active forms of transportation, leading to better overall health. Furthermore, limiting car usage can help prevent accidents and reduce traffic congestion, creating safer and less stressful communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient land use and improved accessibility. In Rosenthal's article, it is mentioned that new approaches to suburban planning involve placing stores within walking distance on a main street rather than in malls along distant highways. This concept encourages residents to rely on walking or public transportation, reducing the need for excessive parking spaces and creating more compact and accessible communities. Vauban's car-free streets and emphasis on public transportation also serve as examples of how limiting car usage can lead to smart planning and more efficient use of space.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are manifold. Not only does it help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, but it also promotes healthier lifestyles and more efficient land use. By adopting car-free initiatives and promoting alternative forms of transportation, communities can work towards creating sustainable and livable environments for its residents. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and actively work towards implementing changes that promote a car-free future.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides important benefits that ensure fairness, certainty of outcomes, and regional representation in presidential elections.

First and foremost, the Electoral College guarantees the certainty of outcomes in presidential elections. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner, under the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome are less likely to occur compared to a direct popular vote. Moreover, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral vote victory.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the entire nation, not just certain regions. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming President. This is crucial for the successful governance and representation of the interests of all Americans. As Judge Posner argues, candidates with only regional appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents, as residents of other regions may feel disenfranchised and believe that the President does not consider their interests.

The Electoral College's focus on swing states also promotes a more informed electorate. By concentrating campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are incentivized to engage with and understand the concerns of voters in these states. As a result, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters. This ensures that the election is decided by those who have received the most information and attention from the candidates.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus predominantly on heavily populated states and neglect the interests of smaller states. By maintaining the Electoral College, presidential campaigns are forced to consider the concerns of citizens from all states, regardless of their population size.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, avoiding the complications and costs associated with run-off elections. This ensures that the election process remains efficient and that the will of the majority is decisive.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high voter turnout in presidential elections indicates that most voters are motivated by the desire to express a political preference rather than the belief that their single vote can decide the outcome. The Electoral College system has not deterred Americans from exercising their right to vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a vital role in our democracy by providing fairness, certainty of outcomes, regional representation, and an informed electorate. It balances the interests of both large and small states, ensuring that the President truly represents the entirety of our nation. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system, as it continues to serve the best interests of our country and its citizens.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your continued leadership and support.

Sincerely,

"Everyone has at less had one car in there life time no matter how yes it was or how old or ragidy it was it was a car that was poluting our air and giving off greenhouse gas. Now I would now what i whould do with out my car but then again there are some benefits or advantages you would have if you didn own a car.

We can start off on now much money you would save if you did have a car. Think about gas is about what 2.99 now right? Or lets just say your driving minding your own bessnious and some edit rams in the back of your new Nisson 2015 car and oh lord i dont think you want to talk about how high you insurgents would go up. People in Vaudan and in most of France don't even have cars 70 percent to be exact. Now its not like a law that they can't have veicals just lot of people choose not to have one. How ever if you do own a car you will have pretty much no where to put it. Street parking,driveways and home garages are actually forbidden in some areas. If you still really really want your car you have only two places to put it. One in a large parking garage at the edge of the development or two you can buy a space for 40,000 along with a home. If you never had a car you wouldn't have to spend all that money on gas,insurgents,getting your car repairedfixed,and a parking spot. That's why 57 percent of people sold there car when they moved to Vauba.

The biggest advantage you would have if you didn own a car is that you will be giving back to mother earth. Cars are responsible for 12 perect of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Cars can also be more stress then there worth having. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. What do you think scards you the most when your dive? Getting in a car crash and seriousaly injuring yourself or worse die on inpacked right? Why don't you save the stress and the fear. Just give up you car. I know what your think what if i work far away etc? Just take the bus or better yet ride a bike to where ever you need to go or walk get some exercise and brake a little sweat. Or just take one day that we all not us own cars to just see how life would be. That's how BOGOTA got started in Colombia. They have been going it for 3 straight years. There are 7 million cizins people walked,hiked,and even skated. The only vehicals that where permitted where buses and taxis and if it rained it didn't stop them participating. Why can't we do that just for one day? If everyone just took one day that using cars I think i would make a big change.

There are many advantages we all would have if we all didn't have a car but I know it will take time for all of us to make that disitoin but hopful its soom before its to late for us and for the world.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in many countries to limit the use of cars as a means of transportation. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use. There are numerous advantages to limiting car usage, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and instead use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce these emissions. This is crucial in combating climate change and its associated impacts.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The passage set mentions how cities like Paris have enforced driving bans in response to high levels of pollution. Car emissions, particularly those from diesel fuel, contribute to the release of harmful pollutants into the air. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation options, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the overall quality of the air we breathe.

Additionally, limiting car usage promotes a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. By using alternative modes of transportation such as walking or cycling, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This not only improves overall fitness levels but also reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Furthermore, reducing car usage contributes to the development of more walkable and bike-friendly communities, encouraging people to be more active and leading to a decrease in sedentary behavior.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to a more sustainable future. As the passage set explains, car-dependent suburbs in the United States and other countries are not feasible in the long term. By adopting smart planning principles and creating compact communities with less space devoted to parking, we can reduce the need for car ownership and promote the use of public transportation. This would not only result in less traffic congestion but also lead to more efficient land use and a reduction in urban sprawl.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement of air quality, promotion of a healthier lifestyle, and contribution to a more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and communities to embrace alternative modes of transportation and adopt smart planning principles to create a more environmentally friendly and livable society. By working together to limit car usage, we can contribute to a healthier planet for future generations.",1
"People all over the United States, even the world, drive their cars to get to where they need to go work, school, the mall its a normal thing. But, the increasing number of greenhouse gas emissions are not normal. Imagine our world crumbling down, our air supply at its alltime minimum, the exuding amout of smog forming around us, our families and friends too ill to breath all because of cars. Along with many advantages, there should be a limit of car usage worldwide.

In the article paris bans driving due to smog, it explains the drastic change in smog formation, leading Paris officials to temporarily ban driving. Though a small percentage citizens citywide ignored the ban, the pollution was lessened enough to end the law after a day. Adding on in a different source written by Andrew Selsky, Bogota started the revolution of a carfree day once a year which promotes ""alternative transportation and reducing smog"". The productivity of this event has caused other countries to do the same, lessen vehicle usage.

Although there are a small number of cities and countries that have reduced their car usage, people can not hold the reliance on those multiple thousands of responsible citizens. Said in the End of Car Culture' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""... Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" and that is without putting an effort like Vurban. Vurban is a small city in Germany that has little to no cars. Stores are purposely placed on a walkway or a main street which eliminates the excruciatingly long car rides needed to get to a specific place. Because of telecommunication, sociologists believe that sooner or later people of America will take initiative and there will be no more vehicles, that the internet will be our form of connection. Therefore, eliminating the threat of greenhouse gasses.

During times of panic and frustration one is tempted to blame. If the beautifully lush world we live in goes crashing down, we all are the ones to blame. We, the ones who use our productivity wisley, will know we did our part limit the usage of cars.",0
"In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally friendly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people for example in Paris,France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of nearrecord pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.

In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to giving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogota, Colombia during ""Carfree day"" for the first time two colombian cities joined Bogota in this unique event. there more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smoothe and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that people can benfit greatly without having cars.

Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car acsidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enoguh for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.

Throughout all of these benfits people can benfit more greatly but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation trafic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.",0

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering both sides of the argument, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. This view is supported by the information provided in the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President.""

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the President by Congress and election by a popular vote of citizens, as explained in the text ""What Is the Electoral College?"" This system consists of the selection of electors who vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation, creating a representation based on both population and statehood.

One strong argument in favor of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Judge Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" is the certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring that a clear winner is determined. This is not often the case in elections based purely on a popular vote, where disputes over the outcome and potential run-off elections can arise. The Electoral College provides a more certain and efficient method of selecting the President.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, so candidates must campaign across different states and regions in order to secure the necessary electoral votes. This ensures that presidents represent the entire nation and not just one particular region, promoting national unity and better governance.

The text ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" also explains that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This allows for more focused and meaningful engagement with voters in these states, who become the main decision-makers in the election. The Electoral College system ensures that voters in these states have a greater say in the outcome, while also maintaining a balance of attention towards both big and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner by requiring a majority of electoral votes, even if a candidate has only a plurality of the popular vote. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and maintains the efficiency of the election process.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" I believe that the benefits of this system outweigh the disadvantages. It ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses on swing states, provides balance between big and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These practical reasons, as highlighted by Judge Posner, demonstrate the value of the Electoral College in our democratic system.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the importance and merits of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. It strikes a balance between the popular vote and representation, promoting fairness, national unity, and efficient governance. I believe that keeping the Electoral College is crucial for maintaining a stable and effective method of electing the President.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make a decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute to efforts to combat climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved public health. The passage set mentions that smog in Paris was so severe that it rivaled Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The poor air quality caused by car emissions can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more efficient use of space. The passage set mentions the development of the Vauban community in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but limited parking spaces are provided. This results in more compact living spaces and frees up land that would have been used for parking. By reducing the need for parking spaces and encouraging the use of public transportation and walking, we can create more livable communities with less congestion and more green spaces.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage set mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that promoting alternative modes of transportation can encourage the adoption of more fuel-efficient vehicles and create economic opportunities in industries related to these vehicles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more equitable transportation options. The passage set mentions that car ownership started to decline in the United States two to three years before the economic downturn, indicating that something more fundamental was happening. This could be due to changing cultural attitudes towards cars and a desire for more sustainable and affordable transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improved public health, more efficient use of space, economic benefits, and more equitable transportation options. As the passage set demonstrates, there are already successful examples of communities and cities implementing measures to limit car usage. By adopting similar measures and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"  The Path to Sustainable Urban Development  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, though this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College offers several crucial benefits that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. With 538 electors in total, a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. This system has proven to produce a clear winner in the vast majority of presidential elections, preventing the need for run-off elections that would only further complicate the already lengthy and complex electoral process. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to disputes over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election, where the popular vote winner lost the presidency. The Electoral College provides a more stable and predictable process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" No single region of the country holds enough electoral votes to elect a president alone. Therefore, candidates are encouraged to campaign across different states and appeal to a wider range of voters. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just the preferences of a single demographic or region. With a direct popular vote, there is a risk that candidates would primarily focus on densely populated areas and neglect the interests and concerns of smaller, less populated states.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states and engage with voters in these crucial battlegrounds. Voters in swing states are more likely to be highly informed and thoughtful, as their votes have the potential to tip the electoral scales. By focusing on these states, candidates are forced to address the concerns and aspirations of a diverse range of voters, ensuring that their policies and platforms cater to a wider array of citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it balances the political weight of large and small states. While the population of a state impacts the number of electoral votes it receives, large states like California still have a greater influence, proportionally, than their population alone would suggest. This is due to the winner-take-all system, which grants a greater number of electoral votes to candidates who win a state, regardless of the margin of victory. This fairness in representation prevents smaller states from feeling marginalized and ensures that candidates address the needs of voters in both densely and sparsely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College serves to avoid the complications that arise from elections where no candidate receives a majority of the votes. Run-off elections would be time-consuming and costly, potentially leading to further political division and uncertainty. The Electoral College method consistently produces a clear winner, thus avoiding the need for additional voting rounds and helping to maintain stability in the election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers several essential benefits and should not be discarded or replaced outright. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to campaign across diverse states, gives value to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While no system is perfect, retaining the Electoral College is crucial for preserving a fair and representative election process in the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will weigh the advantages of the Electoral College and make a decision that best serves the interests of our great state and the nation as a whole. I appreciate your dedication to public service and wish you the best in your endeavors.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Many cities around the world are starting to limit car usage in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable urban environments. This shift away from car dependence is not only beneficial for the environment, but also for the overall well-being of citizens. By limiting car usage, cities are able to promote alternative forms of transportation, create healthier and more livable communities, and reduce traffic congestion.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation options. In the German suburb of Vauban, car ownership is allowed but parking spaces are limited, which has led to 70 percent of families not owning cars. As a result, residents have embraced walking, biking, and public transportation as their main modes of transportation. This shift away from cars not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle for residents. In fact, one resident mentioned that she is much happier without a car, as she no longer feels the tension that comes with owning a car.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more livable communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance along a main street, rather than being located in distant malls along highways. This makes it more convenient for residents to access essential services and amenities without relying on a car. Additionally, limiting car usage reduces noise pollution and creates a safer and more pedestrian-friendly environment, which encourages social interactions and community engagement. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of people participate in a car-free day each year, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams and creating a more peaceful and enjoyable cityscape.

Furthermore, by limiting car usage, cities can also reduce traffic congestion. Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, and as a result, congestion in the capital decreased by 60 percent. This not only improves air quality, but also reduces travel times for those who do need to use the roads, such as public transportation and emergency vehicles. By promoting alternative transportation modes and reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can create a more efficient and sustainable transportation system.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. By promoting alternative transportation, creating livable communities, and reducing traffic congestion, cities can improve the quality of life for their residents and create a more sustainable future. As we continue to prioritize the environment and the well-being of our communities, limiting car usage is a crucial step towards a more sustainable and successful future.",1
"Germany,France, and Columbia,all have something in common, they are cutting down on car pollution. Car pollution is rising problem in the world, making up almost fifty percent of the United states pollution and twelve percent in Europe. From making cars distinct from everyday life to banning all cars for a day,these countries are trying to cutdown on the car pollution build up.

One of the biggest feats in trying to cutdown car pollution is making it an unusual thing in everyday life for a city in Germany known as VAUBAN.This city does not ban cars but even then only about thirty percent of residents in this city own a car and fiftyseven percent have sold their own cars to move here. This city is a home to a mere 5,500 residents, but they all live with in a rectangular square mile. This shows that it is possible to live without cars as personal transport and still be with in reach of stores, work and home.

Another city taking a big step in the fight against car pollution is the well known city of Paris,France. Paris has enforce a partial driving ban in its streets to hopefully clear or cut the air of pollution. The city has made an odd law, ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" When this law was first enforced nearly 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. This law was meant to exterminate the smog because the city was rivaling one of the most polluted cities in the world, Bejing,China.

One of the other cities creating a anticar pollution act is Bogota, Columbia. The city of Bogota has created an annual ""Day without cars"" which is fine with the residents. Instead of cars residents use bikes and buses and other modes of transportation to travel around the city. This event has been rubbing of on a fellow cities in the area. The cutdown on pollution here is slight but will slowly make an impact over time when this annual ""Day without cars"" begins to take place in multiple other cities, hopefully, instead of these three cities.

Avoiding car usage is a difficult feat to an everyday car user but if you can avoid it then it can really effect the environment in a positive way. Making a day for no cars or at least a small amount of car usage can really impact the environment. This movement has even begun to start in the United States and hopefully will continue from then on into the future when we eventually have a whole lot of fueless cars for everyone to drive in.",0
"Cars are seen as a necessity due to the fact that they make everyday lifetasks easier but wait, so can the internet, cellphones and other technological advancements of the modern era. Cars are no longer as useful as they were made to seem due to the fact that the they come at too much of a figurative and literal cost when compared to other technological advancements or houses. Cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases ""choking cities"" which is a large contributed to air pollution. Along with the toll they place on the environment, cars cause stress, leaving a mental and physical toll on your body as well.

Cars are no longer as useful as when they were first invented. They provided forms of easier transportation to communicate and socialize with others, reach the designated location within a shorter time, and limit how much people had to walk. They are stilled used for these purposes today, but are no longer necessary. The internet allows you to ""feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Although there hasnt been a ""solution"" to having to walk, there shouldnt need to be. Cars give people another excuse for being lazy. In Bogota, there is an annual day known as Carfree day. on this day, cars are banned from being used and only buses and taxis are permitted in this capital city of 7 million. With a city of so many you would think that the day would have a terrible turnout, but many people benefited from the experience. It allowed people to view the world face to face, instead of behind a sheet of glass. While either riding their bicycle or walking, people are able to take in the sites and try new things that they'd usually pass by while driving.

Cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases ""choking cities"" which contribute to the worldwide problem known as air pollution. Along with the toll they place on the environment, cars cause stress, leaving a mental and physical toll on your body as well. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission. In some carintensive areas in the U.S. it is 50%. It has gotten so bad that Paris had to enforce a ban on partial driving to reduce nearrecord pollution. The stress this pollution leaves on the environment is similar to the physical and mental toll, caused by cars, on the body. The large amount of car usage causes traffic jams which can lead to stress and aggitation, and sitting in one position for so long can leave stress on the body cramping. Cars can also cause mental stress due to the fact that they cost so much. many people choose not to own them do to this fact, but the ones who do are not only required to pay for the car, but also have to pay additional fees for things such as insurance.

Cars are no longer necessary. There have been many technological advancements made to do what cars can do without the toll placed on the environment and your body.",0
"Limiting car usage is a very good idea. It can save a lot of money, keep pollution from happening,and keep people safe. If more people tend to save money because of cars, then they can buy more stuff. If more people save the environment people can have fresh air to breath in. Multiple resources have been found to support the idea that limiting car use can save a lot of money and make the environment safer.

For example, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that ""As a result of buying a parking space for 40,000, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter."" This quote explains the troubles and tension that one has to deal with when having a car. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" When Vauban, Germany had cars, their bill went up higher for highways instead of other transports. People should start to use other means of transport instead of cars.

In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Robert helps explain the reason why driving should be banned. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris is very smart to do that, because cars create pollution. The way that they partially banned driving is that ""Motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Atleast paris partially protected the environment instead of the whole environment having to be in pollution.

In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author supports the idea of limiting car usage for the concern of safety. Safety is a really important thing in life. Cars can limit the danger of getting in a car accident. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedistrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" If people did not have cars, then nobody would have to worry about accidents and their safety.

In conclusion, limiting driving and the usage of cars can improve the world. It can make it a safer environment, safe money, and stop pollution. These evidences from the excerpts can prove that limiting car usage is a really good idea.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various case studies and trends around the world that demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency.

One notable example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. The community is designed to be car-free, with limited parking spaces at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars in order to move there. This drastic reduction in car ownership has led to happier residents, like media trainer and mother Heidrun Walter, who says she is ""much happier this way"" without a car. This example shows that limiting car usage can improve quality of life for individuals.

Furthermore, reducing car usage is crucial in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

Studies in the United States suggest that Americans are already driving less and buying fewer cars, indicating a potential shift in behavior and a decrease in car dependency. This trend is beneficial for the environment, as transportation is a major source of emissions. It also has implications for the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies to adapt to changing consumer preferences.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on urban planning and public transportation. Planners are now taking the concept of car reduction to the suburbs, making them more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach prioritizes walkability and reduces the need for vast parking lots and highways. By creating communities with easy access to stores and public transportation, we can promote a more sustainable and efficient use of space.

International examples also demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat high levels of pollution, leading to a 60 percent decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia, implemented a car-free day, showcasing the success of alternative transportation options such as buses, taxis, and bicycles. These initiatives not only reduce emissions and improve air quality but also promote healthier and more active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous advantages, ranging from improved quality of life for individuals to mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable urban planning. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impact of reducing car dependency through measures such as creating car-free communities, implementing driving bans, and promoting alternative transportation options. By embracing policies and behaviors that limit car usage, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to share my thoughts on the Electoral College and whether it should be kept intact or changed to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After carefully examining the information from various sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As noted by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the chance of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a popular vote system. In the 2012 election, President Obama received a much higher percentage of the electoral vote compared to his share of the popular vote, illustrating the stability of the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College system promotes a sense of national unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents a candidate with merely regional support from being elected and ensures that the interests of all regions are represented. In a diverse country like the United States, it is important to have a president who can bring the nation together and consider the needs of all citizens.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election results are uncertain. This focuses campaign efforts on key issues and allows voters in swing states to be more engaged and informed. These swing states represent a cross-section of the country and the opinions of their voters should thus hold more weight in determining the outcome of the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment gives smaller states a disproportionate advantage, the Electoral College restores some of the weight to larger states. This ensures that presidential candidates must consider the concerns and interests of states with larger populations, rather than solely focusing on the needs of smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College always produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and costs associated with conducting run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and efficient presidential election process.

It is essential to consider the counterarguments against the Electoral College, such as the alleged unfairness to voters and the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the presidency. However, these arguments can be addressed through reforms and improvements within the existing system, rather than scrapping it altogether.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a valuable institution that promotes stability, national unity, and fair representation. While it may not be a perfect system, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and explore possible reforms to address any concerns raised by critics.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my perspective into consideration when making decisions regarding the electoral process.

Sincerely,

"When each person drives a dieseltussling car, it is like several thousand smoke covered knives being thrown at the soft protective blanket up in the sky. Pollution is destroying our ozone and our environment, but now we need to face our ramifications. Autos are causing cities to form new laws banning these leeches from being driven. Car usage should be limited, because if we dont, our pollution will be worse than it already is, and using a healthy alternative to transportation will lead to a healthier life style.

Pollution produced by our main method of transportation is killing our planet. We live on the wonderful planet earth which has been generous to provide us with a home and food so we can survive, but when our home is destroyed, we will soon become extinct. Global warming is a famous term heard around the globe, and this word is not used lightly. Our world is heating up due to the many green house gasses produced by the emissions of the cars we use. These green house gasses can not escape our atmosphere which then is heated up by the sun and is melting our polar ice caps. These ice caps, not only will flood multiple cities, killing thousands if they do not escape in time, but they also hold our natural fresh water reserve. The green house gasses are affecting our seas and our skies as well. An article called Paris Bans Sriving Due to Smog , written by Robert Duffer, states that ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Beijing is also one of the worlds most populated countries. The terrifying smog and the rising seas are not the only factors leading to our demise. The green house gasses are producing holes in our ozone that protect us from harmful sun rays. Without the ozone, the world would not be habitable because of all the cancer humans will have by just standing in direct sunlight. We are the world, and by killing the world, we eradicate our whole species. We need to help our world with some healthy substitutions to cars.

There are several different ways transportation could be healthy for both the environment and ourselves. The worlds obesity population is higher than ever. An average amount of calories we need to consume per day is about 2000 calories and most of the world are consuming way over that limit. If we supply bicycles to cities, we could burn off those extra calories by just going to public places, events,and even jobs. Biking and walking to places not only work out your physical apearance, but also keeps our mind healthy. Exercise trigger neurotransmitters in your brain to fire off endorphins, like adrenaline, which keeps your body moving and working without putting strain on your muscles. Exercise also fires off dopamine in your mind which produces a sense of joy. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote an article named "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars "" which interviews people from germany about their lifestyle. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Life is much more jovial with no cars, and germany knows it.

There are already different countries that have moderated and replaced their walking smoke factories to their fat burning bikes. We need to follow in their foot steps and moderate if we do not want to be left in the dark ages. The government needs to limit the amount of usage for cars, because the constant use of autos will lead to out doom via pollution, and without cars, people are more likley to live more healthy and happy lifestyle.",0

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there have been calls to change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential role in maintaining the integrity and representation of our nation's highest office.

One of the fundamental reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, which would create significant uncertainty and potential chaos in the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College system ensures that the President is everyone's President. As you may know, no single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a President. This requirement compels presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, campaigning across various states and engaging with diverse constituencies. Consequently, this promotes a sense of representation among the residents of different regions, preventing the perception that their votes do not count or that the President does not have their interests at heart.

I also believe that swing states play a crucial role in the Electoral College system. The winner-take-all method, employed in most states, incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This results in increased attention, detailed policy discussions, and targeted outreach to voters in those states. Swing states tend to have considered and engaged voters who are well-informed about the candidates' positions. By allowing these states to have a significant influence on the outcome, we ensure that the most thoughtful voters are the ones who ultimately decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. The system gives more weight to larger states by granting them more electoral votes based on their population size. Without the Electoral College, smaller states may feel neglected, as candidates would be less likely to campaign in those regions. Maintaining a system that rewards states of all sizes encourages candidates to pay attention to a broader range of voters and ensures that the President is accountable to the entire nation.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner. This reduces the complexities and costs associated with organizing run-off elections, thus streamlining the process and allowing for a swift and decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is essential for upholding the principles of our democracy. It provides certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances the power between large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. While some may argue that a popular vote would be more democratic, the Electoral College ensures a more representative outcome that takes into account the unique characteristics of our nation.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I hope you will continue to support the Electoral College as an integral part of our democratic process.

Sincerely,

Dear [State Senator’s Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or replaced by a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from various perspectives, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for five key reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputed outcomes are less likely under this system compared to a direct popular vote. In an era with highly polarized politics, maintaining a system that ensures a definitive winner is crucial in avoiding extended election crises.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. With each region having a different set of interests and concerns, it is important for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas and neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By requiring candidates to gain support from multiple regions, the Electoral College system helps preserve a sense of inclusiveness in the election process.

Thirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making. Ensuring that the swing states decide the election helps maximize voter engagement and enhances the overall quality of democratic decision-making.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores political balance by giving some weight to large states. Although the Senate already provides a system of representation that balances the power between larger and smaller states, the Electoral College further reinforces this balance. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states naturally receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, thereby ensuring that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College automatically produces a clear winner. This prevents the need for complex and time-consuming run-off elections, which would only complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College simplifies the process and ensures that a single candidate emerges as the legitimate winner.

While I understand the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the idea that it is more democratic and prevents the disenfranchisement of voters in states with no chance of winning, I believe that the current Electoral College system balances these concerns effectively.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to the certainty of outcome it provides, its ability to ensure that the President represents all regions of the country, the importance it places on swing states, the balance it restores to large states, and its ability to avoid run-off elections. These practical reasons outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system and demonstrate the strengths of the Electoral College in our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons of both systems in making your decision.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear Senator, Keeping the electoral college would be a disaster just waiting to happen. It is old, outdated and irrational. Are we really going to keep using the same, old method that our founding fathers used hundreds of years ago? The method itself is unfair to many American voters. It is also unjust to the candidates who won the popularity vote, but not the electoral vote.

The candidates running for presidency usually focus on the bigger states with more electoral votes or ""swing"" states. This makes the voters in smaller states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina feel like their opinions and voices do not matter, that the president will not care for their interests. Having the electoral college gone, means that the winnertakeall system will also be gone, and will insure voters that the candidates will spend more time in their states trying to win their votes as an individual and not as a whole.

In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gone received more individual votes than George W. Bush, but lost the presidency, because he did not receive the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair to the candidate, knowing that you won majority of the populations votes, but lost the presidency. In an article called "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" Mother Jones stated that after the 2000 presidential race, a poll was taken, over sixty percent of voters would prefer a more direct election than the one we have now.

In another article ""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", they argue as to why we should keep the electoral college. The author of the article, Richard A. Posner, said that there is a certainty of outcome, that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. That being said, it shows that the voters' vote do not really matter, because it all comes down to the electoral votes.

Despite the numerous amount of people who disagree with the Electoral College and all the agruements against it, we still keep it. Why? What is so bad about getting rid of the Electoral College? It gives a sense to the voters, that they matter and what they say can determine the fate of who is president.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. This trend is being witnessed in various parts of the world, with communities and cities implementing policies to reduce reliance on cars. The advantages range from environmental benefits to improved public health and increased accessibility to public transportation.

One primary advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By promoting car-free or low-car suburban communities, such as the German suburb of Vauban, emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to improved air quality and a healthier environment.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on public health. The reduction in car emissions can lead to decreased respiratory problems and other health issues associated with air pollution. Furthermore, by encouraging alternative modes of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit, individuals can enjoy the health benefits of physical activity. Studies have shown that individuals who walk or cycle as their primary mode of transport tend to have lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for improved access to public transportation. In car-centric communities, public transportation is often limited, and individuals may be forced to rely on their cars for daily activities. By creating neighborhoods with good access to public transportation, like Vauban in Germany, individuals have more options for getting around. This can lead to increased mobility for those without cars, as well as reduced traffic congestion and less reliance on expensive and environmentally damaging road infrastructure.

Moreover, by limiting car usage, communities can promote a more sustainable and inclusive urban environment. The focus on creating compact neighborhoods with walkable streets and mixed-use development can lead to vibrant communities that encourage social interaction and a sense of belonging. Stores are placed within walking distance, promoting local businesses and reducing the need for large shopping malls located far from residential areas. Additionally, car-free or low-car communities often prioritize the use of bikes and pedestrians, making these modes of transport safer and more accessible for everyone.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves air quality but also promotes public health, improves access to public transportation, and creates more sustainable and inclusive communities. As we witness a shift in behavior towards reduced car ownership and increased reliance on alternative modes of transportation, it is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage for a better future.",1
"With the increasing concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has become a topic of discussion in many communities around the world. There are several advantages to implementing measures that restrict car usage, such as reducing pollution, improving public health, and creating more accessible and inclusive communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study mentioned in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve public health. The high levels of pollution emitted by cars contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues. In Paris, for example, a driving ban was enforced during a period of intense smog, leading to a 60 percent decrease in congestion and significantly improved air quality. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, we can create healthier and cleaner environments for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more accessible and inclusive communities. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This has led to more pedestrian-friendly streets, increased social interaction, and a greater sense of community. By designing neighborhoods with an emphasis on walkability and accessibility to public transportation, we can reduce dependency on cars and foster a stronger sense of belonging among residents.

Moreover, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. In Bogota, Colombia, the car-free day initiative has attracted millions of participants and has had positive effects on the city's economy. By reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as buses and bicycles, cities can improve the flow of goods and services, support local businesses, and boost economic growth.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving public health, creating more accessible communities, and benefiting the economy. As more communities around the world adopt measures to decrease car dependency, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future. By prioritizing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, we can build communities that are less reliant on cars and more inclusive for all residents.",1
"Although a motorized vehicle provides the opportunity to transport citizens from place to place, limiting the usage of a car may be considered more beneficial. Car usage limitations allow the citizens to feel less stressed, show a decrease in air pollution and a promotion towards alternative transportation, and a decrease in habit.

The article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" Source One, suburban pioneers have decided to permanently give up cars. Although the usage of cars are generally forbidden in Vauban, its fellow citizens express that they were ""always tense... are much happier this way"" without the use of a car in their lives. When individuals are stressed, they're constantly worrying and not fully paying attention to surroundings therefore, stress is considered one of the causes of vehicle crashes. Also, the congestion of traffic if not awful enough already will become worse with the crash which causes more individuals to become stressed. Without the use of cars, citizens are less stressed and can go about their daily lives. Vauban is considered to be ""the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life"" because of the attempt to make the city denser and a better place for walking has succeed.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Source Two, mainly focuses on the environmental issues that car usage has been causing throughout the city. After a nearrecord, pollution, Paris strictly enforced a driving ban to ""clear the air of the global city"". The smog from the motorized vehicles is hazardous to our environment which therefore can be damaging to us and our bodies if we only inhale smog. Therefore, health problems are presented among the population and causes an endless loop of health concerns to be dealt with. These can be considered ""solved"" if the environmental issues are presented and dealt with immediately and effectively. Luckily, with Paris going in the right direction with the ban, health concerns will decrease as well as the smog in the air. Because of the ban that Paris has plaaced, congestion was ""down 60 percent in the capital of France"". Presented later, the smog in the city has began to clear enough. Two beneficial causes have been brought forth all because of limitations on the usage of cars.

""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" Source Three, explains how Bogota has a dedication day to the use without cars. According to a business man, Carlos Arturo, he explains how the day of dedication relieves stress and lowers the pollution. In order to transport oneself from place to place, citizens can walk or ride bicycles. Because of the large impact that Bogota has made, ""municipal authorites from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic"". In summary, this city has made quite an influencial mark on others. With prediction, this event could end up carrying throughout the world because of the incredible benefit that it has on our planet: the decrease of air pollution. It not only helps us, but it provides help to the world. Another article, ""The End of Car Culture"" Source 4, explains that a study has been made on the American drivers: ""... are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"". If this pattern continues, it'll provide implications for carbon emissions and the environment, seeing as ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". If we could reduce this, our lives and breathing conditions can be improved dramatically. The quote, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit"", means that if we can break the habit of buying cars, there will be no more habit to continue with.

In conclusion, the reduction and limitations of car usage will not only be beneficial to us, but it'll become greatly beneficial to our environment which becomes an endless loop of helping one another out.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that are becoming increasingly apparent in various areas of the world. One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which is crucial in combating climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and this number can be even higher in certain areas of the United States. By reducing car usage, we can effectively decrease these emissions and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also lead to a more efficient and organized urban planning. In the German suburb of Vauban, for example, streets are completely car-free, except for a few main thoroughfares. This design encourages residents to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, or public transit. Placing stores within walking distance and creating accessible public transportation systems are also part of this approach. By adopting this model, suburbs become more compact, reducing the need for extensive parking spaces and encouraging a more efficient use of land.

In addition to reducing emissions and promoting efficient urban planning, limiting car usage can also have positive health impacts. The passage about Bogota's car-free day highlights the benefits of promoting alternative transportation for both individuals and communities. People who participate in such events experience a decrease in stress levels and have the opportunity to engage in physical exercise by biking or walking. Moreover, by reducing the number of cars on the road, air pollution is decreased, providing cleaner air for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential economic benefits it can bring. The passage mentions how delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the driving ban in Paris. However, these short-term setbacks can be outweighed by long-term economic gains. For example, investing in public transportation systems and alternative modes of transportation can create jobs in industries such as construction, maintenance, and operation of these systems. Additionally, by reducing the reliance on personal vehicles, individuals can save money on fuel, parking fees, and car maintenance.

While there may be concerns about the impact of limiting car usage on car manufacturers, it is important to recognize that the shift away from car culture represents a larger cultural shift. Younger generations are showing less interest in car ownership, instead choosing alternative ways of getting around, such as using public transportation or car-sharing programs. Car companies are also adapting by rebranding themselves as mobility companies, offering a range of transportation services beyond personal cars.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and varied. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to promoting efficient urban planning, improving public health to potentially boosting the economy, limiting car usage has far-reaching benefits. By adopting models like the car-free suburb of Vauban in Germany or implementing car-free days like in Bogota, cities and communities can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping this system for electing the President of the United States. While it is true that there are arguments against the Electoral College, there are also several compelling reasons to retain this method.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. Despite the occasional dispute over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election, the electoral vote winner generally aligns with the winner of the popular vote. This ensures that the candidate who receives the most support across various states is elected as President. The winner-take-all system in most states helps to create a landslide victory for the winning candidate, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""Everyone's President."" With its requirement for a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system prevents a candidate with only regional favor from being elected. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign across different regions, thereby representing the interests of a diverse range of constituents. It ensures that no particular region has an undue influence over the election outcome, fostering a sense of inclusivity among voters.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. The winner-take-all approach encourages candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the outcome is uncertain. By doing so, they engage voters in those states more effectively, leading to higher voter participation and informed decision-making. Furthermore, swing states are more likely to have the most thoughtful voters who closely follow the campaign and have a substantial impact on the election result.

The Electoral College also serves to balance the power between large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on population, it presents an opportunity for states with larger populations to receive more attention from presidential candidates. This prevents lesser-populated states from being neglected or overshadowed, ensuring that their voices are heard during the campaign and considered in the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This feature provides for a clear and decisive winner, preventing extended and potentially contentious election processes. The Electoral College has consistently produced a definitive outcome, which helps to maintain stability and efficiency in the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, the high voter turnout in recent elections suggests otherwise. Many voters recognize the importance of expressing their political preferences, regardless of the potential impact on the national election. Moreover, the Electoral College serves as a safeguard against the potential influence of a few swing voters in determining the fate of the presidency, ensuring a more balanced and representative outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides several practical reasons for its retention. Its inherent advantages, such as certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections, make it a sensible and efficient method for electing the President. I urge you to consider these points when deciding on the future of this system.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

"Dear, We dont need another voting crisis over the small states, the representatives voting how they want to vote to suit their needs. Our voting system needs to be perfected, so we dont have any more tie elections of complications. The Electoral College system is very easy to get unbalanced and played around with to get the outcome that they so desire. As a country we should abolish the Electoral College system and vote baised of off popular vote.

When the whole country votes for the president, in reality we are really voting for a group of electors to do this job for us. In article 2"" Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This is saying that the people really dont directly vote for the president and in that time anything can happen to the voting data. Another clame to help that point is article 2 ""conciter that state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The excerpt from article 2 is saying again that anything can happen to the data and it can be easily tampered with. In article 3 "" its the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a stats of electors."" Again this still says that we are not directly voting and the people want that.

The ""winner takes all"" voting method is not really effective because if a little less than half of claforna votes democrat and a little more than half vote republican, should all 55 votes go to the republican candidate or should that percent go to the candidate? In article 1 ""Most states have a ""winnertake all"" system that awards all electors to the wining presidential candidate."" This system is qutie unjustice and not equal to the rest of the states expesilly for the ""swing"" states.

This system of electorial college is not the most balenced of the systems that our nation can come up with. In article 2 "" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" This so called ""amazing"" system has manny defaults and those defaults will cause huge problems tor the rest of the nation. In article 3 "" A tie in the nation wide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number."" So ties in the national voting for the president can have a tie and is not that efficent in the way that we find who wins.

There are some bright sides to this style of voting. In article 1"" The founding fathers established it in the Constution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election."" A compromise is good for our country and it was created a long time ago might be older than dirt. Also in article 1"" The electors are generally chosen by the candidates politicle party."" So atleast the people in whom the people are trusting to put their votes in is by someone that the head of the politicle party trusts.

To conclude the electoral colege system needs to be retired and the country needs to vote off of popular voting. The people need to represent them selves and not by some random person who could mess with the voting data to get who they want to win the election. Each state has to give up all of its votes to one side of the 2 parties.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This is evident in various parts of the world where efforts are being made to separate suburban life from auto use. By adopting a more smart planning approach and reducing reliance on cars, communities can experience benefits such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased access to public transportation.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. Vauban's residents have given up their cars, and the streets are completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs and a few streets on the edge of the community. This experiment has resulted in 70 percent of families not owning cars and 57 percent selling a car to move to Vauban. Residents report feeling happier and less tense without the burden of car ownership.

Reducing car usage is important for addressing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, communities can contribute to a significant reduction in emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to take action to increase public transportation options in suburbs.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, and it resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. Cold nights and warm days caused air pollution to trap car emissions, and diesel fuel was identified as a major contributor to the problem. By reducing car usage, cities can significantly improve air quality and create a healthier environment for residents.

Limiting car usage also promotes the development of more accessible communities. Bogota, Colombia, has been implementing car-free days for several years. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during these days. The turnout has been large, and people have embraced alternative transportation options. This has led to the construction of bicycle paths, parks, sports centers, and improved sidewalks in Bogota. Other cities around the world are also adopting similar initiatives to create more walkable and accessible neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. It can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased access to public transportation. Communities that have embraced car-free or car-reduced lifestyles have reported increased happiness and reduced stress. As efforts to limit car usage continue globally, more people are recognizing the benefits of smart planning and reduced reliance on cars.",1

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democratic process that should be preserved. In this letter, I will outline the reasons why the Electoral College should be retained based on information from various sources.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and election by popular vote. According to the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors who vote for the President and Vice-President. Each state is allotted a number of electors equal to the sum of its congressional delegation (members in the House of Representatives plus two Senators). This system ensures that both the popular vote and the representation of each state are taken into account in electing the President. (""What Is the Electoral College?"", Office of the Federal Register)

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is the claim that it is undemocratic. However, Judge Richard A. Posner argues that it actually increases certainty of outcome. He points out that the winner of the Electoral College vote usually reflects the winner of the popular vote, and in rare cases where the popular vote winner does not win the electoral vote, it creates a landslide victory for the winner. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could result in more disputes and recounts, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the election. (""In Defense of the Electoral College"", Judge Richard A. Posner)

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Candidates need to have support from multiple regions in order to win the electoral vote. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas and neglecting the interests of voters in less populous regions. The Electoral College requires candidates to campaign in swing states, which encourages them to address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters. This leads to a more inclusive governance and reduces the risk of polarization. (""In Defense of the Electoral College"", Judge Richard A. Posner)

In addition, the Electoral College provides more attention to states with larger populations, as discussed by Judge Posner. This helps to balance the political influence of large and small states, as larger states receive more attention during the campaign due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that the concerns and interests of citizens in both small and large states are taken into account when electing the President. (""In Defense of the Electoral College"", Judge Richard A. Posner)

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, preventing further complication of the election process. Under this system, a clear winner is typically determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular vote. This strengthens the stability and efficiency of the election process by eliminating the need for additional rounds of voting. (""In Defense of the Electoral College"", Judge Richard A. Posner)

While opponents argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely driven by the belief that one vote can decide an election. Rather, voters participate to express their political preference. The Electoral College system ensures that the concerns of citizens in all states are taken into account through the allocation of electors, maintaining a balanced representation across the nation. (""In Defense of the Electoral College"", Judge Richard A. Posner)

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. It is a fair and inclusive system that ensures representation for all states, increases certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, the benefits it provides outweigh the potential drawbacks. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the preservation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and an advocate for the democratic process, I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College for the election of the President of the United States. While some may argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital and fair representation of our diverse nation, ensuring that every region has a voice in the presidential election.

One of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of a presidential election. Unlike a popular vote system, where disputes over the results can occur, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to emerge. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This structure provides stability and prevents prolonged disputes over election outcomes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes national unity by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. With the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, no single region can dominate the election process. As Judge Posner suggests, this ensures that the president has broader support and is not merely a representative of one particular region. It encourages candidates to campaign in all areas of the country, ensuring that they understand and address the diverse needs of different regions.

In addition, the Electoral College helps to highlight the significance of swing states. These states, where the outcome is often uncertain, receive more attention from candidates and campaigns. By focusing on these states, candidates are forced to engage with voters and address their concerns, leading to a more informed electorate. This method allows for the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from candidates, to influence the final outcome, as pointed out by Judge Posner.

The Electoral College also ensures that large states have their fair share of attention from candidates. As Judge Posner argues, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution reduces the weight of large states. However, with the Electoral College, large states like Florida can still command significant attention from presidential candidates. This balance between large and small states is crucial in maintaining fairness and representation in our election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for run-off elections. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes, it guarantees that a clear winner emerges. This avoids the complications and expenses associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more streamlined election process.

While some may argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is the most effective and fair method for electing the President. It ensures stability, balances regional interests, highlights swing states, provides attention to large states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Abolishing the Electoral College, as argued by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" may lead to a concentrated focus on highly populated areas, while neglecting the needs and concerns of other areas of the country.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the significant benefits of the Electoral College and to support its continuation. The Electoral College serves as a crucial safeguard to protect the representation and voices of all regions in our great nation. By maintaining this system, we can uphold the democratic principles upon which our country was built.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider my views and make the best decision for our nation.

"""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"", quote from the excerpt ""The End of Car Culture"", explains that people in the United States have started to become less dependent on cars. Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportation that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.

Smog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasoline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a ""Carfree day"", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these ""Carfree days"" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a 31.00 or 22euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This ""Carfree day"" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.

When people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. ""The streets of Vauban are completely ""carfree"" except the main thoroughfare"", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban's familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.

Cars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a carshop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the carshop would cost a least 100.00 out of pocket.

Limiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Carfree day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportation besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world.",0
"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether we should keep it or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from multiple sources, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for several reasons.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the possibility of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only had 51.3% of the popular vote. This shows that the Electoral College tends to create a clear winner.

Another important reason to keep the Electoral College is to ensure that the president is everyone's president. With its requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to campaign in different regions and consider the interests of all Americans. By having candidates with broader appeal, we can avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement that residents of certain regions may experience if they believe their votes do not count.

The Electoral College also brings attention to swing states. In the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, it is mentioned that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states, who are most likely to decide the election, pay closer attention to the campaign. By engaging these voters, we can ensure that the most thoughtful and informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the influence of big states. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of citizens in large states, as winning their votes can have a greater impact on the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, such as Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has provided a clear winner. This eliminates the need for complicated additional elections and ensures a more efficient and decisive process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in the text by Bradford Plumer, the information provided in Judge Richard A. Posner's text provides practical reasons for retaining it. It fosters certainty in the outcome, ensures that the president represents all Americans, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept. It may have its flaws, but it provides a practical and effective method for electing the president of the United States. It promotes fairness, ensures the president represents all citizens, and balances the influence of different states. Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter.

"In a rapidly urbanizing world, the concept of car-free cities is emerging as a revolutionary approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban life. These cities advocate for a transformation in urban planning, where private automobiles are heavily restricted or entirely absent, making way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a paradigm shift in urban living, focusing on sustainability, health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment. The potential benefits are numerous, but they come with unique challenges that must be addressed.  One of the key benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Efficient use of urban space is a central theme in car-free cities, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Less reliance on private cars translates to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and lower stress levels for urban inhabitants. Furthermore, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. Redesigning urban areas for car-free living is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthwhile aspiration. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"I argue in changing the electoral college , popular vote would be a chance for normal americans to get there voice heard in the government. A big problem is how the voters votes go straight to the electoral college and wouldnt make a change at all also how theres a bigger chance of a tie happening in the electoral college then by popular vote One reason why the electoral college should go is because the voters votes arent really being heard. For example in paragraph 10 it says that ' under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect for the president "" , thats techinally saying that the electors are the ones who are really voting our voice means nothing we could have wanted another president to have won but if the electoral college gets more votes then us then so be it , thats our new president! We dont even know who the electors really are they could have been picked by anyone like how it says in paragraph 10 they could have been picked by the presidential candidates themselves who knows. They say we control who the electors vote for but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane.

A second reason is how theres a bigger chance of electoral college tie happening then a popular vote one like how it says in paragraph 12 "" in 1916 , a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and a 3,3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"". If the electoral college has a tie then theres even a bigger chance of the people voice not being heard at all. Once a tie happens the election goes to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president as said in paragraph 12 , a single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have no say compared to the 55 representatives from California that makes Wyoming have no voice in the election compared to california. The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

Finally thats all i have to say regarding how the election should be changed to having the popular vote determine the president , we want our voice to be heard! Sometimes the electoral college doesnt pick the president that we wanted and if there was a tie to happen in the electoral college which is at high risk some of the states voices wouldnt get heard at all , thats why we should switch over to popular vote maybe more people would actually get up and go vote because they would know their vote actually means something. Like it says in paragraph 14 "" Abolish the electoral college! "".",0
"Dear Florida Senator, Our country, the United States of America, elects our presidents by something that is called the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a selection of 538 electors who vote to elect the president. The popular Presidential vote ties into the Electoral College by when a person votes for a presidential candidate, that person also votes for their chosen panel of electors from that state. Many citizens of the United States believe that this electing process is unfair and takes away the freedom to elect our President, but the Electoral College is fitting for our country because the candidates can campaign in all regions and that there will not be as big as a dispute in the Electoral College election than a popular election.

To begin with, the United States should keep the Electoral College for the presidential election because the candidates campaign in all the regions. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal."" Source 3, stanza 19. If the United States only had a popular vote election, the candidates would only campaign to the big stateshigher population, and not the the smaller stateslower population. Then the smaller states and regions we feel like they are not involved or matter in the election. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchisedto feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" Source 3, stanza 19. Also, a presidential candidate does not want to stay in a region where he will know he will win. The presidential candidate wants to be desired and win the elections in as much regions as possible, so more of his campaign electors go to the Electoral College. ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Source 3, stanza 19.

Secondly, the United States should keep the Electoral College for the presidential election because there will not be as big as a dispute in an Electoral College election than in a popular election. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" Source 3, stanza 18. And most of the time in an Electoral College vote, the popular vote candidate wins! ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely."" Source 3, stanza 16. Also, in a popular election, anyone can vote. That means citizens who don't know many things about the candidates or the politics can choose the future president for the United States. In the Electoral College vote, popular voters vote for a candidate's electors, who are knowledgeable about their candidates and politics, and who are carefully selected by the candidate's party. ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party"" Source 1, stanza 5.

In conclusion, the United States should definitely keep the Electoral College for electing the president because it is fair to all the regions and there will not be as big as a dispute in the Electoral College vote than the popular vote. In the popular vote, if a person's desired candidate did not win, they could lash out, maybe violently, at other people in their community who voted for an opposing candidate. Also, the Electoral College vote is fair for the smaller states, for in the Electoral College, they get a number of electors based on their state's population. This is better than in a popular vote, where the whole state of California could vote for one candidate and the state of Rhode Island could vote for an opposing candidate. The California candidate would have more votes than the Rhode Island candidate, for Rhode Island is considerably smaller than California. Over all, the Electoral College election is the best way for the United States to elect their president. It's the way it always has been, therefore it should stay that way.",0
"Automobiles play a huge role in our everyday life. Its how we travel to work, home, and even just to cruise around the neighborhood. But does anyone think about what these traving pieces of machinery do to our planet? Cars are producing a environmentally harmful fumes such as greenhouse gas, and smog. These two chemicals are harmful for our ecosystems, as well as our health. It is unnessacary that people should be allowed to kill not only the nature that surrounds us, but also themselves so we need to become a carfree nation.

Giving up driving is like giving up a bad habit, you always have the urge to do it again. But is it all worth it. Think about it, you get up for wor, or school and you walk outside where the sun is shining and the birds are chirping and you think ""Wow it is beautiful out here"". And what do you do... you insert your self into a small metal barrier stoping you from being one with nature. so where am I going with this you might ask. ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" says Heidrun Walter, a mother of two who gave up her car and decided to walk. When you are driving you can not say hello to your friends, or neighbors. In fact you cant have any social contact which is not healthy.

The U.S. is one of the largest producers, and consumer of motorized transportation devices. Companys such as Ford, Chevy, Jeep, and lincoln are producing cars that no one could refuse. But are they safe? Car companys advertise that they are ""safe"". Airbags, seatbelts, even blindspot protection moniters are some of the advances in vehicle safety technology, but technology does not alway work correctly. Most death tolls are not by murder, or suicide, but by car accidents. So why is it that all this technology that engineers are putting in our automobiles are not saving lives? This is why walking or running or cycling is an ideal choice of transportation, and why automobiles should come to an end.

Im not saying that all cars should be throw into a scrap yard and be forgot about. I know that there are those classic cars that every car collector wants, or that family car that has been passed down for ages. Im just stating that cars use should be reduced for the safty of our planet and ourselves. We always want to keep our old memories. Its just like keeping you grandmothers handmade scrapebook...priceless. We are of nation of collectors that can not and will not get ride of our memories and a car is one of the biggest ones that we can hold on to.

President Obama has goal that he is trying to achives that will lower the greenhouse gas emission say ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. It is leaders such as Obama that will save this planet, and all we would have to do is become a carfree world. With the help of all the citizens we can become a clean, healthy, and happy world.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for maintaining the Electoral College system in presidential elections. While there are valid arguments to change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several advantages that should be considered. I have thoroughly analyzed the information from various sources and would like to present my case based on the texts provided.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome, which is less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. As highlighted in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all approach in most states creates a landslide victory, minimizing the possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This stability in outcome ensures that the election process does not suffer from prolonged uncertainty and potential disputes.

Another critical benefit of the Electoral College system is that it promotes the representation of all regions and discourages candidates from focusing solely on heavily populated areas. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, regional favorites without nationwide appeal are unlikely to be successful presidents. Under the Electoral College, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to secure the necessary electoral votes for victory. This ensures that the president represents various regions of the country and takes into account the interests of all citizens, regardless of their geographical location.

The third advantage of the Electoral College system lies in its promotion of swing states. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winner-take-all approach incentivizes candidates to focus on competitive states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention, leading to better-informed and thoughtful decision-making. By concentrating campaign efforts in these states, candidates are more likely to engage with citizens, discuss important issues, and address the concerns of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance regarding the influence of large states versus small states. Large states, as Bradford Plumer highlights in ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" receive more attention from presidential candidates due to their greater number of electoral votes. This helps prevent the political disadvantages that large states face as a consequence of the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing a larger political weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must campaign across both large and small states, guaranteeing a more inclusive approach to the electorate.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, reducing the pressure for additional elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. This eliminates the complications and challenges associated with run-off elections and maintains the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College system can discourage some potential voters in states where their preferred candidate does not have a chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of eligible American citizens still exercise their right to vote in presidential elections. As voters, we express our political preferences and values, regardless of the potential impact of our individual votes on the national outcome. The Electoral College does not prevent citizens from engaging in the electoral process but ensures that all states and regions have a meaningful role in electing the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, as established by our founding fathers, offers crucial benefits that should be taken into consideration. It promotes stability in election outcomes, encourages the representation of all regions, focuses campaigns on competitive swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider these points in your decision-making as you deliberate on the future of our electoral system.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will carefully consider the perspectives presented in this letter along with the information provided in the supporting texts. I look forward to witnessing your thoughtful determination on this matter that affects our democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear State Senator, we should not keep the Electoral College. I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electorsal college is unfair. It's outdated and irrational. Many people prefer election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. They shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president.

One of my reasons is because under the electorsal college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect for the president. The electorss can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on the state, the electorss are picked by state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. The electorsal college isn't the best way to handle elections because it is the electorss who elect the president, not the people, which to me sounds unfair. Voters can't always control who their electorss will vote for and voters do get confused sometimes about the electorss. So if you really agreed on one president, chances are that might not be the president who's gonna be elected because the electorss can choose the other person running for president instead.

The electorsal college is unfair. The electorsal college consists of 538 electorss. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the president. Richard Nixo, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agreed on abolishing the electorsal act. According to a gallop poll in 2000, over sixty percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Voters don't want the popular vote winner to lose the presidency but because of the electorsal college it can happen. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electorss.

Lets say that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electorss. Those electorss can always defy the will of the people. Faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they pleased. Why on earth would they do such a thing. They should care about what voters believe in. In 1960, people who favored separation based on race in the Louisiana legislature nearly actually succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss so that they would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means the popular votes would not have actually gone to Kennedy. That is not fair. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

State Senator, I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes because it's fair. The electorsal college should stay in the past and should'nt be used anymore. The best way is for the election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and decided to vote for whoever they wanted. Selfish much? People shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president. These electorss should consider what the people want. I believe Elections by popular votes for president of the united states is the best option.",0
"Believe it or not there are ways people may be harming the environment without actually knowing it. If you really think about it though there are many ways you can help prevent harm to the environment. One of them is limiting car usage. The advantages to giving limits to this could be very helpful to restoring our world.

A city in Germany has gone the extra mile to solve problems due to car use. What the residents of Vauban, an upscale suburban community have done is, they have all given up their cars. Street parking, driveways, and garages are not allowed. The only way to park is to buy a parking spot along with your home for 40,000. Because of this movement 70 percent of families there do not own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to move to Vauban. A media trainer and mother of two said that when she had a car she was always tense but now is much happier. This no car movement is called ""smart planning"". A reason it started is because studies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in america. The basic ideas from Vauban are being adopted around the world attempting to make suburbs more compact with less space for parking. Now in the US many agencies are promoting car reduced communities. Also legislators are starting to act. Many say public transport in suburbs will play a much larger role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. More suburbs like this one could change the world.

In Paris there had been days of nearrecord pollution. To help clear the city's air Paris enforced a partial driving ban. Monday, motorists with even numbered liscence plates were forced to leave their cars at home or pay a 31 fine. Rejecting the fine resulted in having your car impounded. As a result 60 percent of congestion was down in France's capitol. The smog due to car usage was cleared enough on monday to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the next day. In Columbia a similar day is taken place every year. A car free day where people hiked, biked, skated and took buses to work instead of driving their cars. If you violated this you would be fined 25. Even in rainy weather people participated just to help lower stress and air pollution. This campaign has sparked a revolution. It has also created the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, parks, and sports centers. It has caused the replacement of pitted sidewalks with broad smooth ones, cut traffic, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have appeared. If every country had a day like this we could make a unbelievable difference.

According to recent studies Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer liscences each year. Even though America has basically been the birthplace of cars and is one of the world's prime car cultures its love seems to be cooling down. The number of miles driven in the US peaked in 2005 and steadily declined in the years following. In april 2009 the number of miles driven per person was 9 percent below its peak and equal to where it was in 1995. Part of the problem has most definitely been recession but as the economy recovers the decrease in driving has not changed. According to a research proffessor at University Of Michigan car ownership per household started to lower two to three years before the downturn. If this trend persists it will have benificial implications for carbon emmissions and the environment. One of the things causing this is the internet which allows people to feel more connected to eachother without driving to meet friends. Also people carpooling and biking have helped. There has been a large drop in peoples age 1620 getting their liscence. They organize summer jobs and their social lives around where they can walk or take public transportation, or carpool. Between 2001 and 2009 driving by young people decreased 23 percent. All of this helps conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.

In conclusion there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Many communities have taken part of this trend and it is rapidly being recognized around the world. Taking part in this helps the community and environment. Anyone can do it.",0
"  A Sustainable Urban Dream  In an era marked by rapid urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a visionary approach to address the complex challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a groundbreaking perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from multiple sources. By adopting car-free or car-reduced lifestyles, individuals and communities can experience numerous benefits, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and greater accessibility to public transportation and local amenities.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Air Quality and Reduced Emissions
Limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality, as cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article on German suburb Vauban, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This data highlights the pressing need to reduce car usage in order to combat climate change. By minimizing the number of vehicles on the road, communities can reduce harmful pollutants and improve public health.

Body Paragraph 2: Reduced Traffic Congestion
Another advantage of limiting car usage is a reduction in traffic congestion. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to smog demonstrates how limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion and improve overall mobility. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation such as public transit, cycling, and walking, cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads and improve traffic flow. This not only benefits those who choose alternative modes of transportation but also individuals who rely on cars by reducing travel time.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Physical and Mental Well-being
Limiting car usage has positive impacts on both physical and mental well-being. As stated in the passage on Vauban, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. By walking or cycling instead of driving, individuals can engage in regular physical exercise, improve cardiovascular health, and reduce the risk of obesity. Additionally, active transportation options such as walking or cycling have been linked to improved mental health and reduced feelings of anxiety and depression.

Body Paragraph 4: Greater Accessibility to Public Transportation and Local Amenities
Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to public transportation and local amenities. When communities are designed with smart planning principles in mind, as seen in Vauban's car-free streets, residents have easier access to public transportation options such as trams and buses. This accessibility allows individuals to have more sustainable and convenient travel options. Additionally, by designing communities where essential services and amenities are within walking distance, individuals may rely less on cars for everyday activities like grocery shopping, which in turn reduces the need for excessive car usage.

Conclusion:
As demonstrated by the passages analyzed, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and alleviating traffic congestion, we can create more sustainable and livable cities. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes physical and mental well-being while increasing accessibility to public transportation and local amenities. As the global population grows and the impact of climate change becomes more apparent, it is crucial that we consider the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing smart planning principles in our communities.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and have far-reaching implications for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation options, and create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful greenhouse gases and pollutants into the atmosphere. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and improve air quality for everyone.

In addition to improving air quality, limiting car usage also helps reduce traffic congestion and promote alternative transportation options. As highlighted in the passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, residents have found alternative ways to get around such as walking and cycling. This not only reduces the number of cars on the road but also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle. Furthermore, limiting car usage can also lead to the improvement of public transportation systems, as seen in the example of Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day has been successfully implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

By limiting car usage, we can also create more sustainable and livable communities. According to the passage, new approaches to suburban planning, such as the one adopted in Vauban, involve placing stores within walking distance rather than along distant highways. This helps create more compact and accessible communities, reducing the need for cars and fostering a sense of community and connection. It also reduces the overall need for parking spaces, allowing for more green spaces and recreational areas.

Finally, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. As mentioned in the passage about Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of the city's smog. This resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and had positive effects on the environment. Additionally, by reducing our dependency on cars, we can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs, leading to increased disposable income for individuals and potentially boosting local economies.

In conclusion, there are clear advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation options, create more sustainable and livable communities, and even have economic benefits. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to recognize the importance of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies and initiatives that promote alternative transportation and reduce our reliance on cars.",1
"Countries like France, Columbia, Germany and USA have took part in reducing greenhouse gasses by reducing if not excluding vehicle transportation. Stats have shown less amounts of carbon in the air and less congestion in immense cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia.

Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing evennumbered license plates to drive one day and have the oddnumbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to evennumbered plates the following day. Anyone against that restriction would be given a 22euro fine or 31 dollar fine. That method decreased smog and congestion by 60 percent.

Source three talks about the country of Bogota, Columbia. This town or city has took a big step into reducing gas emissions where not only they participate but other local towns and cities as well. They contribute by leaving their cars home all day for one day to reduce the amount of carbon and smog in the air which helps the environment. People hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. violaters faced a 25 dollar fine. Not only does this benefit the environment but it helps people conversate more with each other. "" it's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

As it is said in source one, "" As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The small suburb town of Vauban, Germany is home to 5,500 residents were its perimeter is just a rectangular square mile. It is separated away from all city life where people get around by walking to nearby stores. It may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life. Developed countries or developing countries should think about all the gasses that go into the air and damage the surroundings and take part in to reduce the harmful greenhouse gasses.",0
"Dear, state senator The Electoral College should be removed from our way of voting we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because state senators are voting for our president and not us. As stated by Mr. Bradford Plumer in his article "" The Indefensive Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong "".

"" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the offchance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" This claim tells how the president is choose and its not by our votes its by the slate of electors votes.

Also,the Electoral College should be removed from our way of voting we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because the electoral college is a disaster waiting to happen. Mr. Bradford Plumer states in his "" The Indefensive Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" "" The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The importance of this quote is because it tells us that there could be more disasters to come from the Electoral College.

The Electoral College should stay our way of voting because with it we avoid runoff elections. Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" that we avoid runoff elections. "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively.There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...."" The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.

Also, the Electoral College should stay our way of voting because of majority vote.The Office of the Federal Register states in their article "" What is the Electoral College?"" in the third paragraph. "" The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House od Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" This quote shows how each state has so many electors.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is both good and bad for our voting system. Some systems are wrong and some are right but its a hard decision to make with the Electoral College because its both wrong and right. We dont need no disasters in the voting system we already have enough disaters in the world that we live in.",0
"Dear State Senator, I do not like the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's basically a winnertakeall system in each state. Especially with California it represents 35 million voters and if they are really close and have a tight margin the winning side of the votes takes it all, which means all the 55 representative votes go for that one side. getting rid of it would be fantastic because we could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the the peoplevoters.

First of all, an example of this could be Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Like almost all cases award electoral votes on a winnertakeall, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state. the popular vote was very close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.

Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president which wouldn't be what the voters want in some cases.

Third, according to the Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The Electoral college is not the best way to choose, it has minimum chances of succeeding in the future. I think a direct vote would work the best for the voters but yet the the electoral college has its cons.

Conclusively, the Electoral College is not the best way to vote. By a bare minimum margin of votes, it could cost the election for the other candidate. The bigger state could be a catastrophy and it would be unfair. Last, the Electoral College is irrational, outdated, and unfair for the most part with its winnertakesall.",0
"Limiting car usage is beneficial to more than just the environment, it is also beneficial to humans. With all the pros and very few cons of limiting car usage, it would be impractical to not make the change. Some may argue that it would waste time to limite car usage, however, if widespread limitation of car usage occurs then the way we live will evolve to adapt to life without much car usage, making it far more convenient in the future.

A common misconception is that limiting car use is solely beneficial to the environment. In paragraph three a resident of Vauban is quoted saying, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this shows that humans too can take advantage of limiting car use. In common culture today, destinations are far spread out and not compact unless in a large city. This is because it is possible to transport one's self those distances in a car. Limiting car use would effect the suburban culture of being spread out and change it into a more compact, convenient environment.

The obvious reason to limite car usage is to reduce air emissions that would allow us to have a safer earth to live on. Pollution has become a legitimant problem and if change isn't made, then the earth will be changed for the worse. Large cities where cars are abundantly used have a major problem with smog as seen in paragraph ten. In attempt to clear record breaking amounts of smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban and it worked. This shows that by limiting car use change can be made to our environment for the better.

Without using a car, one would clearly need to find an alternative method of transportation. Common alternatives such as biking or walking spark a much more active lifestyle for those who do so. As seen in paragraph twentyeight, Bogota sponsors alternate forms of transportation and when this active lifestyle was embraced by the city, it changed the city for the better. As result it is quoted that, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This clearly displays a much healthier, active lifestyle by those who limite car use.

All of these products result in clear advantages caused by one thing, limiting car usage. It would be unsensible to not acknowledge that there is change that needs to be embraced in limiting car use in our society before it is too late to change the culture of driving.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can have far-reaching benefits for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can create more sustainable and livable communities, while also addressing the growing concern of greenhouse gas emissions.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in pollution. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant cause of climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

In addition to reducing pollution, limiting car usage can also help to create more accessible and walkable communities. As mentioned in the passage, the German suburb of Vauban has implemented a car-free policy, resulting in streets that are safe and welcoming for pedestrians and cyclists. This can lead to improved physical and mental health for residents, as they are encouraged to be more active and spend more time outdoors.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. As more people choose alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit or biking, the number of cars on the road decreases. This can result in shorter commute times and less stress for individuals who no longer have to deal with the frustrations of traffic jams. As mentioned in the passage about Paris, a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The passage mentions that car ownership in the United States has been decreasing, with more people choosing not to own a car. This can lead to significant cost savings for individuals who no longer have to worry about car payments, insurance, and maintenance. Additionally, the development of car-reduced communities can create new opportunities for businesses and services, as stores are placed within walking distance of residential areas.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing pollution, creating more accessible communities, reducing traffic congestion, and providing economic benefits, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future. It is important for individuals and communities to consider these advantages and actively work towards reducing their reliance on cars for the benefit of both ourselves and the environment.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact our lives and the environment. Car-free communities, such as Vauban in Germany, demonstrate how reducing reliance on cars can lead to happier, healthier, and more sustainable communities. By adopting smart planning strategies, suburbs can become more compact and accessible to public transportation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while some US areas have rates as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can directly reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.

Moreover, car-free communities promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. When cars are no longer the primary mode of transportation, people rely on walking, cycling, or using public transportation. This increased physical activity can lead to improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of chronic diseases, and better overall well-being. Additionally, car-free communities enhance social interaction by creating vibrant streets, where people can walk, cycle, and interact with their neighbors.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of air pollution. Cities like Paris have enforced partial driving bans to combat smog and improve air quality. Car emissions, particularly from diesel fuel, contribute to high levels of particulate matter in the air. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative transportation, we can lower air pollution and create healthier environments for everyone.

Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to prioritize public transport in transportation bills. By investing in public transportation and making it more accessible, communities can reduce transportation costs for individuals and families. Additionally, car-free communities can repurpose land used for parking to create more vibrant and economically productive areas.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more vibrant and economically productive communities. As more car-free communities emerge and people embrace alternative transportation options, we can move towards a more sustainable future.",1
"Do you know what pollution is? Have you ever taken a trip by car? Well, cars emit a significant and substantial amount of pollution into the atmosphere. Such pollution will result in a damaged atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to decrease car usage, because there are several advantages that will arise from limiting car usage.

To begin with, limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution in the atmosphere which will result in cleaner air and healthier cities. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer writes, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Overusing cars in the metropolis had caused the air to become extremely and dangerously polluted. The pollution had resulted in smog, a mixture of fog and pollution from cars that is very harmful. The partial driving ban that was enacted in Paris had positive effects in the city, because after one week of the partial driving ban, the smog had cleared and the ban was rescinded for certain cars. While the ban in Paris was a way to handle the destructive pollution from cars in the city, there are only a handful of regulations that are in place towards making cities less polluted. For example, in India the air is polluted to the point where one can see the pollution that resulted from smoke from cars. In the carintensive areas of the United States, passenger cars are responsible from up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. It is imperative that more regulations are enacted in the most dangerous and polluted cities. Cleaner air can only be achieved by limiting car usage around the world, especially in the most carintensive and polluted parts of the world.

The reconstruction of the ozone layer will result from limiting car usage around the world. Burning fossil fuels and cars emitting greenhouse gases have damaged the atmosphere in a colossal way. Greenhouse gases have been exponentially breaking down our atmosphere. As cars are continuously overused in many parts of the world, the danger of radiation increases as well. The connection between the destruction of the atmosphere and increases of greenhouse gases of the atmosphere will continue to be increasing until several actions are taken to prevent such disasters. In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" some cities and towns have also gone as far as having suburbs where there are barely any cars in the streets. In such cities, the air is cleaner, people are healthier and there is air pollution as well as noise pollution. Unless we make more efforts to limit car usage around the world, the planet will be plagued by a poor atmosphere, irradiated locations and unhealthy people.

Finally, while cars are being overused around the world, there are a handful of efforts being done to protect our planet from pollution. People must be informed of the consequences of too much car usage. Even though there are just a handful of regulations decreasing air pollution, people must continue to limit car usage in order to receive positive effects.",0
"We all know that driving makes life easier in terms of getting from point A to point B, but there are also many benefits that come from not driving or maybe not even owning a car. Not driving proves to affect the community in a positive way such as: less polluted air, happier people, and less congestion on the roads.

A study in Paris showed that the less drivers there are on the roads, the less smog there is in the air. France uses diesel and they tend to have more smog than ""other European capitals"" par.17 who use gasoline. So by cutting the amount of drivers on the road, it also cut the amount of smog in the air. People used the roads less due to the amount of smog in the air and when there were less poeple on the road, there was also less pollution in the air, making for clearer skies. Also, in the United states, the percentage of people getting their licenses and of those who own cars has gone down in recent years. ""If the pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" par. 34. Just like in Paris, the fewer people driving, the better our environment gets as the years go on. Alternatives to driving could be walking, using ""public transportation"", or biking to get to the places we need to go. These alternatives can help us ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" par. 43 which are not only beneficial to us, but to our environment as well.

In Germany, there are certain places where you are not permitted to own a car and if you do, you have to pay 40,000 to be able to park it in a garage along with the payment of your house. Obviously, not many people are going to want to pay that much money, so they get rid of their cars in order to live in those parts of town. Not owning a car can even reduce the stress levels of some poeple and make them happier in the long run. A ""mother of two"" stated ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" par. 3. So maybe this whole not owning a car thing is not only good for the environment around us, but also for our physical and mental well being. Sure, driving is nice, but it can be very stressful when having to deal with all the careless drivers around us and all the rules and responsibilities that driving entails.

Not only will less driving improve our environment, it will also result in less congested roads. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog"" par. 14. No one likes having a polluted environment around them, and the more pollution there is, the less crowded roads will be. The clearer the roads are, the clearer the skies around us are. In conclusion, driving does have its benefits, but not driving has even more, such as: the ability to keep our environment healthy and clean, less congestion on the roads, and happier people all around.",0
"The electoral college is unfair to voters. Electing the president should not be on how many electors vote for the candidate, it should be about how many people in each state vote for this representative. The electoral college is only 538 electors that vote for president which is not everyone that goes to the election booth and votes for president. In the electoral college, voters do not vote for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. Over 60 percent of the voters prefer direct election instead of the electoral college.

Voting for president should be about the number of people who vote for a candidate. Voting should not be about the number of electors each candidate has. Direct voting is what should be taking place, not an electoral college. Direct voting is when a voter goes to an election booth and votes for who they think should be president. Their vote does not get sent to an electoral college where electors vote for the candidate. Every voter goes to an election booth to vote the candidate they think should be president, they dont vote for the electors.

""The electoral college is unfair,outdated and irrational."" This is true because with the electoral college, voters vote not for a slate of the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. The electoral college's only purpose is so the candidate can have group of electors just in case the number of votes is low for the candidate. The electors votes are the only votes that really matter which is not fair to the voters. Out of everyone that votes for president and having only 538 votes count does not seem fair to the voters at all.

Over 60 percent of voters prefer direct election. 60 percent is the majority of voters the rather have direct election instead of the electoral college. Since most of the time it is majority rules then why not cut the electoral college from the voting process? I'll tell you why, because ever since the disaster hat occurred in 2000, the candidates still need a chance at winning the election even if they do not get to visit every state during the campaign.

Yes, the electoral college is unfair and irrational but it has also created a new system known as the winnertakesall system. This system allows the candidates to focus on the states that they do have a chance winning over instead of focusing on the states that they know for a fact have no chance of winning over. Over all, the electoral college has no point in being apart of the voting process. The only voting process this country should yse is direct voting because it is fair to everyone. The election process should be a fair process, it should not have everyone voting and only having 538 vote count. Even when over 60 percent of the voters choose direct voting, the country still agrees to use the electoral college. All in all I have to agree with Bob Dole, Mr.",0
"  A Sustainable Urban Vision  In a world undergoing rapid urbanization and grappling with environmental issues, the idea of car-free cities is emerging as an innovative approach to reshape the urban landscape. Car-free cities propose a transformative shift where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, promoting sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban living. This essay explores the concept of car-free cities, with a focus on their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities represent a vision of urban living that prioritizes sustainability, public health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities contribute significantly to reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, playing a crucial role in the global fight against climate change.  Public Health: These cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents.  Optimal Use of Space: Car-free cities efficiently repurpose urban space by transforming parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This revitalization enhances the overall quality of life in these spaces.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is substantially reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience for residents and commuters.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be financially burdensome. By relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their overall financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals depend heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are needed to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that rely on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions for the successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Essay:

Limiting Car Usage: A Step Towards a Sustainable Future

In today's world, it is becoming increasingly important to find alternative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat the adverse effects of climate change. One such solution that is gaining traction is the limitation of car usage. This idea is not only being implemented in cities around the world but is also gaining the support of citizens who are realizing the numerous advantages of living without cars.

One prime example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. Residents of this experimental district have made the conscious decision to give up their cars. Streets are completely car-free, with the exception of the main thoroughfare for public transportation. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into this eco-friendly neighborhood (Rosenthal). The residents of Vauban have reported a higher level of happiness and a reduction in stress since giving up their cars. This highlights the psychological benefits of reducing car usage and relying on alternative forms of transportation.

The impact of car usage on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be understated. Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some heavily car-dependent areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and move towards a more sustainable future. This shift is crucial in mitigating climate change and its devastating effects.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also improve the health of our cities. The smog problem faced by cities like Paris has forced them to enforce partial driving bans in order to clear the air. During these bans, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent and the city's smog levels were comparable to heavily polluted cities like Beijing (Duffer). These measures not only improve air quality but also make cities more livable by reducing traffic congestion and noise pollution.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also revitalize urban areas and create more accessible communities. Suburban development has traditionally been centered around cars, with wide roads and large parking areas. This model is slowly changing as cities adopt smart planning principles. Communities like Vauban are placing stores within walking distance of homes, making it easier for residents to get their daily needs without depending on cars. This kind of compact and accessible urban development can relieve pressure on city infrastructure and promote walkability (Rosenthal).

It is important to note that efforts to limit car usage are not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia has implemented a car-free day, where millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. As a result, the streets of Bogota are temporarily free of traffic jams, and alternative transportation methods are promoted (Selsky). This initiative demonstrates that limiting car usage is not only feasible but also scalable to other cities around the world.

While it is important to acknowledge the potential negative implications for the car industry, it is necessary to adapt to the changing cultural shift towards alternative forms of transportation. Car manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as mobility companies, recognizing the need to diversify their offerings beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal). This shift in the market presents an opportunity for the development of innovative transportation solutions that meet the needs of a changing society.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that go beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It improves happiness and reduces stress for individuals, improves air quality and health in cities, revitalizes urban areas, and promotes accessibility and walkability. As more cities and communities around the world embrace this shift towards car-reduced living, it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to support and implement initiatives that limit car usage. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and offer my perspective on the potential benefits of either keeping the current system or switching to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe it is crucial to examine the arguments surrounding this topic and consider how it impacts our democracy.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. This means that the winner of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, which reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results. As highlighted in the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winner-take-all approach in most states creates landslide electoral victories that reflect the preferences of the majority in each state. While there have been instances where the popular vote winner did not secure the presidency, these situations have been rare.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters the idea of having a president who represents the entire nation. In the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Richard A. Posner argues that the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This stimulates candidates to campaign in multiple states and consider the concerns and interests of diverse regions. By doing so, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning, which is vital for effective leadership and fostering national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the same article, swing states receive increased attention during election campaigns, and voters in these states tend to pay closer attention to candidates' messages and policies. This engagement of thoughtful voters in the decision-making process is essential for a well-informed electorate and a robust democratic system.

The Electoral College also provides an important check against the dominance of large states. As highlighted in the article, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the allocation of electoral votes based on population. Without this system, candidates might prioritize campaigning solely in these populous states, neglecting the concerns of smaller states. The Electoral College, therefore, protects the interests and voices of citizens in states with smaller populations, ensuring their voices are not overshadowed by the majority.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. By producing a clear winner, it avoids the complications and costs associated with conducting additional elections. This efficiency streamlines the election process, allowing for a seamless transition of power and maintaining stability in our democracy.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns over fairness and the potential for voter disenfranchisement, it is important to consider all aspects of the issue. The Electoral College has been a long-standing pillar of our democratic system, and any potential changes should be carefully evaluated to ensure the preservation of our democratic principles.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers important benefits, including certainty of outcome, representation of the entire nation, incentivizing engagement in swing states, balancing the influence of large states, and avoiding run-off elections. As we continue to evaluate the best approach for our presidential elections, it is imperative to weigh the advantages of the Electoral College against proposed alternatives, such as a popular vote system.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this vital matter. I trust that you will carefully assess the arguments on both sides and make a decision that best serves the interests of our democracy.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing the reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable communities, improve public health, and mitigate climate change.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable communities. The German suburb of Vauban is a prime example of how life can go on without cars. Streets in Vauban are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. This design encourages residents to use public transportation or walk and cycle instead. In fact, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This shift towards car-free living reduces traffic congestion, noise pollution, and the need for large parking spaces. It also promotes a stronger sense of community and encourages people to interact with each other.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The article highlights how passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease these emissions and improve air quality. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat intense smog levels, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. By reducing air pollution, we can reduce the prevalence of respiratory problems and improve the overall well-being of citizens. Additionally, promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking and cycling can help individuals lead more active lifestyles, reducing the risk of obesity and related health issues.

Limiting car usage also plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming. The decrease in driving observed in the United States suggests a cultural shift away from car dependence, with people opting for alternative transportation options. This shift could have far-reaching implications for carbon emissions and the environment. If the trend continues, it will have a positive impact on reducing emissions and combating climate change. Moreover, limiting car usage can prompt car manufacturers to adapt their business models to cater to changing consumer demands. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, focusing on a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It creates more sustainable communities, improves public health, and helps mitigate climate change. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the success of car-free initiatives in reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and fostering a sense of community. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.",1
"The Electoral College has been in the Constitution since out founding fathers established it. It was an agreement between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of President by a popular vote of citizens.

As we all know the Electoral College is a process which is the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are two political parties. Democrats and Republicans. Electors are usually chosen by the person running for office's political party, but each state has their different views on how they are selected and what their responsibilities are. When the time comes, usually every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, presidential elections are held. This is the day citizens go out to their local polls and help their electors vote for President. It's not the citizens themselves who vote for the President, when citizens vote they're actually voting for their candidates electors. The process of the Electoral College has been carried on since it was first put into the constitution. So, why change it now?

The Electoral College consists of over 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. The citizens vote sometime in November in polls and wait for the election of the new President. As stated before, the citizens vote does not elect the president, it helps the electors choose. However, that doesn't mean that the citizens don't have a purpose in voting. Popular vote is part of an election as well. It is rare that the Electoral College is higher in numbers that its popular votes. This is sometimes because states award electoral votes on a winnertakesall rubric.

This process requires a candidate to have transregional appeal, meaning there aren't favorites. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This also means the presidential candidate will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states they know they'll win in. This is a highly unlikely result that will outcome as a successful president. If this were to occur, voters in other states would feel discouraged and feel as if their votes do not count. This is why the Electoral College has this as a requirement.

In most tossup states, voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and deciding or knowing who that they will decide to be president. They are most likely thoughtful voters and are perferred to be the ones to decide the election. In big states, the Electoral College adjusts the weight in the political balance that these states lose by population. In additon, large states get more attention of candidates in a campaign that the smaller states do.

These are just few of many resons why the Electoral college should stay as is. If they were to change the Electoral College, what would they do to elect a president? It would be chaotic and the people may rebel. In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College as it is should be the only process to elect a president.",0
"Cars have been a necessity to us for as long as I can remember. Billions of people around the world use cars everyday. Without cars in our lives many people would be lost and not know what to do. Thinking of a world without cars isunreasonable to thepeople oftoday, but if theythought of all the good not driving everyday does for the world then it would probably be a different story.

Many places are enforcingpeopleto go without there cars transporting themeveryday, which could be a good thing. Heidrun Walter a man in source 1 states, ""Seventy percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move here."" By saying this he is showing how many people like living their lives without all the troubles cars can cause. People of this community dont have to worry about being ran over by cars or being stuck in traffic everyday. David Goldberg, another man in source 1 also states, ""All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" In saying this he portraying thatwe need to focuson more important things andstopworryingabout cars, which hurt us more in the long run than they do helping us.

Vauban isn't the only place that has enforced the rule of not using cars. Many other places have done so also.Robert Duffer states, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" By saying this the author is explaininghow the use of cars have dramatically polluted a city. Just think, if there were no cars, then there would be less pollution to worry about hurting all the city's. It is not hard to ride a bike to the places you need or want to go. Instead of using cars everyday and hurting our environment, people should think of how much good they would be doing and money they would be saving by taking another type of transportation than just cars.

Bogota, Colombia has also taken the no car use into affect. They have used many other types of transportion such as hiking, biking, and even skating to there destination. Businessman Carlos Arturo from source 3 says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" He and many other citizens of this place agree with saving our environment and not using cars. Not using cars is less stressful because your not consistently worring about gas, the car breaking, or getting into an accident with another driver.

Just imagine your life without using a car everday. Not usinga car isn't thatbad and doesnt hurt you or the people around you as much as it does having one. Using a car everyday puts your life at risk, takes your money, and hurts the environment.Life without cars would be simpler and less stressful in our world today.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By implementing strategies to reduce dependence on cars, such as car-free zones and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create safer, healthier, and more sustainable communities.

One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to research cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing reliance on cars, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution highlights how car emissions contribute to smog and poor air quality in cities. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for citizens.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. As mentioned in the passage about Vauban, Germany, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, long commutes, and increased stress levels. By creating car-free zones and promoting alternative transportation options, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall well-being of citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can foster more connected and vibrant communities. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, describes how millions of residents hiked, biked, or took buses to work during a car-free day, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams. This not only promotes alternative transportation but also creates opportunities for people to interact with each other, leading to stronger social connections and a sense of community.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to economic benefits. The passage about the United States decreasing car ownership and driving miles suggests that it may have a long-term cultural shift with implications for the car industry. While this shift may have negative effects on car manufacturers, it can result in positive economic changes in other areas. For example, as more people rely on alternative modes of transportation, there may be increased demand for public transit systems, bike-sharing programs, and other related industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting public health, fostering connected communities, and potentially bringing economic benefits, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential that we prioritize implementing strategies to limit car usage and promote alternative transportation options for the benefit of all.",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This change is being driven by the realization that cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and are contributing to climate change. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can not only reduce our carbon footprint but also improve our quality of life.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. In this upscale suburb, residents are not allowed to park their cars on the streets or in their driveways. Instead, they have to park in large garages on the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of the families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of them actually sold their cars to move there. Vauban is an example of how suburban life can be separated from auto use, and it is part of a larger movement called ""smart planning."" This movement aims to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking.

The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous. First and foremost, doing so helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and slow down the progression of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been implemented to reduce air pollution. During these bans, only cars with specific license plate numbers are allowed on the road, while others face fines for driving. These measures have been effective in reducing congestion and improving air quality. By implementing similar measures in other cities, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for our citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a more active and healthier population. In Bogota, Colombia, the city has implemented a car-free day, where cars are banned from the streets and alternative forms of transportation are encouraged. This event has been successful in promoting biking, walking, and public transportation, and has helped to reduce traffic jams and increase physical activity levels among citizens. By limiting car usage, we can create cities that are more walkable and bike-friendly, leading to healthier and happier communities.

In addition to these advantages, limiting car usage also has economic benefits. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can invest in and improve public transportation systems. This can make commuting more efficient and affordable for everyone. It can also help to reduce traffic congestion, which is a major issue in many urban areas. By investing in public transportation and creating more compact and walkable communities, we can improve the overall quality of life for our citizens.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing our reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and create more efficient and sustainable communities. It is clear that limiting car usage is a crucial step in combating climate change and creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"To the senator of florida, I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposedly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an favored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallop poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly proffered president according to source 3, there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occurred in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.",0
"Millions of people around the world use cars, trucks, or any means of transportation, although some cities have started to limit or even ban their car usage. This has both made people happy and others were angered. Even so limiting car usage is actually beneficial in many ways.

Limiting car usage is a beneficial idea because it benefits with the environment. Cars have been known for polluting the skies and the very air that we breathe. As a matter of fact ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars"" source 1. This means that if this magnitude of greenhouse gases are being emitted by passenger cars alone then the air will be polluted and animals plants and other organisms will die. Additional evidence supports the fact that car limitation is a beneficial act to society. According to Source 3 by Andrew Selsky, the people of Bogota Columbia have been satisfied with the limitations of car usage in the city, the article states that ""it's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution""source 3. This means that in the limiting the idea of car usage we can decrease the pollutants that poison may living things around the world.

Another advantage in limiting the amount of car usage is that it lowers traffic. Many of todays roads are conjested by thousands of people using the road for their own purposes in shrinking the level of cars being used we can shrink that by a large amount. This is supported by Source 2, written by Robert Duffer, in this article he explains that cars, trucks, etc. are the cause of much congestion and pollution. This contributes to why Paris decided to pass a partial driving ban in Paris. According to this source since the ban car congestion went down by 60 percent source 2. This means that the streets are now safer and clearer in the area. Other sources state that car bans in Bogota Columbia have lead the residents of that city to find other means of transportation to devoid traffic source 3. This means that if cars are limited then traffic will decrease.

A benefactor in limiting car usage isit eliminates stress. Car infested areas have meant tons of stress. By limiting the cause of the problem then you eliminate the problem itself. According to Source 1 people in the outskirts of Germany have become more relaxed in life since cars have been banned. ""I feel less tence"" one of the people the author interviewed said. This key evidence means that if cars are limited then people can live a relaxed worry free life.

Car limitations are a beefit to todays society in ways that it can progress human society rather than pull it back with all the problems it causes. Are cars really what society needs.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent as cities around the world experiment with car-free zones and car-reduced communities. These initiatives aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote alternative modes of transportation. By limiting car usage, cities can become more compact and accessible, with less space dedicated to parking. This shift towards ""smart planning"" can have numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban in Germany. In Vauban, residents are not allowed to have street parking, driveways, or home garages. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a more relaxed atmosphere, with verdant streets filled with pedestrians and bicycles. This shows that limiting car usage can lead to a happier and more enjoyable living environment.

The impact of cars on the environment is a major concern. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By limiting car usage, particularly in suburbs where cars are heavily relied upon, it is possible to significantly reduce these emissions. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and promoting a sustainable future.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage also has other positive effects. It can decrease traffic congestion, improve air quality, and make cities more walkable and bike-friendly. For example, after a partial driving ban in Paris to combat smog, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent. This shows that by reducing car usage, cities can become more efficient and livable.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can encourage the use of public transportation and other alternative modes of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, resulting in eerily traffic-free streets. This initiative not only reduced pollution but also showcased the potential for alternative transportation to be successful.

The trend of limiting car usage is not exclusive to specific countries or regions. In the United States, there has been a decrease in car ownership, with Americans driving fewer miles and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior has been attributed to various factors, including the availability of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of car-sharing programs. This cultural shift towards reducing car usage is beneficial for the environment, as transportation is a significant source of carbon emissions.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation. Initiatives such as car-free zones and car-reduced communities are being implemented in various cities around the world, demonstrating the potential for a future with reduced car reliance.",1

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for the Presidential Election

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen of this great nation to express my support for keeping the Electoral College for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several practical advantages that make it a preferable method of electing our nation's leader.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides a certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the president is elected with a clear majority of electoral votes, reducing the likelihood of contentious disputes over the results. In an election system solely based on the popular vote, these disputes could occur more frequently due to closer margins.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters the concept of ""everyone's president."" Under this system, a presidential candidate must have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency. Candidates must campaign in a broader range of states, promoting national unity and understanding. This prevents a situation where a candidate with only regional support becomes the president, which could lead to a sense of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, as mentioned by Judge Posner, encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on swing states. By doing so, they are more likely to engage with voters directly, ensuring that these voters are well-informed and thoughtful in making their decisions. This emphasis on swing states promotes a more informed electorate, as they receive more attention and information from the candidates compared to voters in non-competitive states.

The Electoral College also offers a balance of power by giving larger states a greater influence, albeit indirectly. While some may argue that this is unfair, it is crucial to remember that the Electoral College partially compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate as dictated by the Constitution. By providing each state with a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of population size, smaller states still maintain a voice in the election process. This balance ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and interests of both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This avoids the complications and potential divisions that may arise from extended election processes. Precluding the necessity of run-off elections streamlines our electoral system, allowing for a prompt and decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may not be a perfect system, but its practical advantages make it a better choice for electing our president than a popular vote. It offers a certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, provides a balance of power among states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While understanding the concerns against the Electoral College, I firmly believe that the benefits it offers outweigh any argument for change.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully before making any decisions that could affect our electoral process. I trust in your wisdom and judgment to make the best choice for our great state and country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting car usage could come off as absurd to some people. They ask ""Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?"" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more convenient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevalent in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have positive effects on the environment.

The greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowledge that the Earth is in a state of selfdestruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmful emissions come from cars and other gaspowered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environment that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article ""The End of Car Culture."" The article states that a limit to car usage would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions."" This article does not only say that cars are large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.

Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous.",0
"The United States of America is constantly referred to as the ""Land of the Free"", but if America really was the land of those who are free, why can't an American Citizen vote for their presidential candidate? It's ridiculous that people have to spend a day voting for a group of people who then will vote for the presidential candidate they want. It's a waste of time. The election should be changed to popular vote due to the fact that their is always the uncertainty of which presidential candidate the elector will ultimately choose, American Citizens don't get the option to have their political voices heard, and there is a lack of representation.

When the American citizen chooses the electors that are in favor of who they want, they have no idea whether or not the elector they choose will ultimately select the presidential candidate they want. As Bradford Plumer states in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people."" There is no absolute guarantee that the elector selected will vote for that presidential candidate which is one of the many reasons that the electoral college could result in something disastrous.

It almost seems pointless to even have American Citizens vote. They do not vote for the presidential candidates of their choice. As written in paragraph 10 of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, bur for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" It's much simpler to just vote directly for the president that way it is easier to determine and makes so that every vote counts.

The electoral college does not fully represent every single citizen in a state. Richard A.

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president , that,""..the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carryint their stateDemocrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" There are states that are mostly one certain political party, so of course they will want to vote for their party's presidential candidate. This causes the other party's vote to be practically irrelevant which will cause a person to not even bother voting.

The electoral college is outdated and should be changed. The popular vote represents every citizen fairly. It also is directly voting for the presidential candidate instead of voting for a group of electors that is just a waste of time. Popular vote eliminates the uncertainty that electors bring. Overall, popular vote is a winning situation for all of America and causes the title ""Land of the Free"" to actually apply and make sense.",0
"Dear state senator, I as a citizen of florida, and of the United States of America, have the right to vote for the president of my country. I feel as though this right is taken away from me by the electoral college system. The electoral college is unfair and unjust to the people residing in the states. The electoral college may turn off potential voters because they may have the mind set that one vote does not matter because the president will be chosen by the electoral college anyways. The electoral college does not nessicarily speak for the people because the majority vote for a certain candidate will take all of the electoral college votes in one state. It is a possibility that the election is tied by electoral votes because the electoral college comes out to be an even number, therefor creating chaos in the political world.

When it comes to bigger states the majority completely overrules the minority even if the votes are 51% to 49%, so the majority candidate will take all of the electoral votes for that state. so this does not speak for all of the people, only the majority vote. Bigger states have more electoral college votes than smaller states, not giving the smaller states enough say in who becomes their next president. With popular vote, the size of the state you live in is not taken into account. All of the peoples votes are taken into account, not just the majority.

With the electoral college, you pretty much vote for the electors of your state, who then vote for the president. They pledge to a certain candidate according to their political party. How can you trust that they will always vote for who they say they are going to vote for? It is no gaurentee, they might just vote for whoever they please, even going against their own political party. In some rare cases the popular vote for one candidate has overruled the electoral vote for another, but the electoral winner has come out on top. Showing not what the people want, but what the electoral college has decided.",0
"Car usage is very popular in this world we have come to know. It used for many means of transportation like going to work, school, social events, or just simply going shopping or hanging out with friends. Those are some up sides to having and using a car. But they are some down sides as well. I will be explaining the down sides of using a car as well as the advantages of limiting car usage.

My first reason in this topic that i have chosen to tell you about are ""Carfree"" cities. what are Carfree cities? well the name says it all is a new project they are working on in europe of this city who is car free. This new city has no cars, no street parking, no driveways or or home garages. Why do they exist? well the obvious answer is to minimize car pollution that are creating green house gases and are polluting the air and more places can adopt this idea and have more ""carfree"" cities so we can save the planet and ultimately save our selves from extinction because we did not know how to maintain our planet clean. Also a thing a like about this new ""Carfree"" city is that theres a main street where theres all the stores at a walking distance like how great is that? u can just take a ten to twenty minute walk and go shopping for anything like grocery, shoes, clothe, restaurants instead of driving to a mall along some distant highway and ultimately that is where everybody is so hanging out with your friends and meeting all up in one place is at a walking distance and if you dont have any friends well you make new friends at this main street because that is where everybody is.

Another great reason for considering less car usage is less traffic. Who does not like less traffic? everybody hates traffic is slow, boring, and annoying. Now if we have less traffic that means we have less commute time when trying to get to work if you have a job that is far from your home and that means you get to work sooner and on time and hopefully get a raise because you feel like you dont get paid enough to do what you do. Also if we have less traffic we have less commute time and what does that mean? well it can mean multiple things like having more time to sleep because you dont have to worry about waking up early to beat the morning traffic like my mom and plenty of other people do. At the end of the day you will be able to get home quicker so you can spend more time with your family and do stuff you usually cant because of the time you spend at traffic.

My last reason is a very important reason and it is simply ""safety"". Think about it, it is simply just common sense. if they are less cars in the road at one time then the chances of car accidents decreases. Now i dont know about you but that sounds like a win win to me. One theres less accidents so theres less people in the hospital so they dont have hospital bills to worry about and less accidents means less traffic as well. And also if you ban the cars for a day or have one of them ""carfree"" cities you have less drunk drivers one because they dont have a car so they will probably just drink at home and two if the bar or where ever is that there going to drink is close enough then they can just ""walk"" there sober and ""walk"" back to the house drunk instead of being in a car a causing a fatal accident.

Ultimately i feel that the usage of cars should be limmited because of many reasons. This reasons are as follows. Less car pollution. living in a carfree city so you are able to walk everywhere. Less traffic, less commute time, having more time to do stuff. and last but not least the safety of drivers. personally i think we should supervise the usage of automobiles and have more ""carfree"" cities and have days where car usage is baned or restricted by some amount.",0
"Here in America, with our ""broad expanses and suburban ideals"" Rosenthal, para. 3, the automobile is the way in which we move: it takes us to school, to the office, to our homes, to the homes of others, to distant, unexplored places. Entire buildings and businesses are dedicated to this wonderful invention. However, as American culture shifts and we focus less and less on the car itself, the advantages to limiting our use of this tool become increasingly evident: less polluted air, more costfriendly alternatives, and the bonding of whole communities. This turnaway from a carfocused society could certainly change the American perspective on the automobile industry as a whole.

Cars, despite some of their clear advantages, cannot provide the necessary advantage of lesspolluted air. Automobiles in the United States can produce up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in carintensive regions European passenger cars can produce up to 12 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Europe Rosenthal without cars, these greenhouse gas rates dramatically drop. One example of this is the temporary ban of driving a car in Paris due to recordbreaking smog levels. According to an article by Robert Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog,"" and that colder nighttime weather and warmer daytime weather caused the warmer air to ""trap car emissions."" People from other countries also seem to be enthusiastic about limited car use and its effects. Carlos Arturo Plaza of Bogota, Colombia, who participated in his city's 3rd annual Day Without Cars, says that "" 'It's a good opportunity to...lower air pollution ""Selsky. In our own country, as Americans buy less cars and register for less driver's licenses, sociologists can conclude that ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" Rosenthal, para.6. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will allow cleaner air, which could eventually lead to healthier living standards across the globe, as well as healthier and more diverse ecosystems and biomes. With the limited use of cars, this could all be a possibility.

Not only will this restriction of car use allow for less air pollution, it could also lead to producing more costfriendly methods of transportation. Cars and their accessories are often expensive to maintain and to purchase, so the creation of other ways to get around are a must to those who cannot afford such maintenance or purchases. In a passage by Andrew Selsky, he states that Bogota's Day Without Cars has allowed for the ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"", along with ""broad, smooth sidewalks"", to travel on. In the booming and populous city of New York, its bikesharing program and ""skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls"" Rosenthal allow the world to see the shift towards cheap yet affective alternatives to transportation. Michael Sivak, research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, has a son who uses Bay Area Rapid Transit, even though it often takes longer than driving, simply because it is cheaper and a car is simply ""not a priority"" Rosenthal. Alternative transportation is definitely on the rise as car usage becomes less and less of a trend.

While all of these advantages to limited car use affect us all, the one that will most directly and immediately affect people is the bonding of whole communities. When car use is reduced, there is more opportunity for interaction with others, whether it be through modern technology such as the cellphone or social media, or through facetoface communication as seen in a good oldfashioned conversation between two people. Various factors, according to Mimi Sheller, professor at Drexel Unviersity, are accountable for this community bond: the Internet, which allows for connection with people without driving to meet them the ""renewal of center cities"" to draw in ""empty nesters"" Sheller, Rosenthal as well as carpooling apps and services. Vauban, an entirely carfree suburb in Germany, has adopted a nocar policy in an attempt to separate suburban life and automobile use, an asset in a new project known as ""smart planning."" This separation allows its citizens to have more personal interaction, with its businesses being a short walk from their homes and less space to park a personal automobile. This compacted suburban example in distant Germany is also being adopted in some places in America as well, and it may eventually be the future of American suburb life. With these changes come more and more opportunity to delve a deeper connection with the citizens who live in your area.

America has long been pictured as ""one of the world's prime car cultures"" Rosenthal. It's the home of many famous and renowned automobiles, including the Ford Model T and Detroit, Michigan, where Chrysler automobiles are manufactured and exported all over the globe. However, as the United States evolves into a different sort of country, so does its focus on the car. Restricting use of the car offers up many advantages to its citizens: less greenhouse gas emissions, more costfriendly options to transportation, and the opportunity to bond with your community. As the American Dream continues to change, so will the way in which we move.",0
"arguments on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occurring today. Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College. This is because less disputes are likely to happen and not voting will not effect the election.

On the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. In ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", author Bradford Plumer claims ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" because ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" This means that the candidates focus on the ""tight races of the swing states."" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote counthowever, changing to election by popular vote will cause many disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.

To begin, the Electoral College is fair to the states, leaving fewer disputes. In ""Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will receive the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.

In addition, the Electoral College method does not get affected by the ones who chose not to vote. In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner states that ""knowing the voters vote has no effect gives them less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign."" But, ""voters in presidential electons are people who want to express political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election."" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.

To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.",0
"The Elector College ishould be aboliished becauise of it'is many flawis that it hais.

Firist and foremoist, preisidential election iis not about the people. In the article named, ""The Indefenisible Electoral college:Why even the beistlaid defenise of the isyistem are wrong"" it talkis about how the people don't get to vote for the preisident. The article isayis,""Under the Electoral College isyistem, voteris vote not fot the preisident, but for a islate of electoris, who in turn elect the preisident."" Thiis iis moistly unfair, the people ishould get to decide whether whom their preisident might be not isome electoral choisen by the politacl party or preisidency campaignis. Thiis law deoisnt follow the wayis of the conistitution even though it wais eistabliished by the founding fatheris. It'is very abisurd becauise, the conistitution istartis with, ""We the people"" and in thiis caise the people iso to ispeak, dont get to vote for their own preisident. There iis no reaison why electoral are the oneis who'is vote count on the election becauise they dont have the minor idea of what the people want. In addition to that, if the people vote for the candidate'is electoris, how do the people know that the electoris are voting for the running candidate they won? Well they isimply don't. Stated in Source 2 under ""What'is wrong with the electoral college"" it talkis about how electoris vote for whom which ever candidate they want. The article isayis,""Can voteris control whom their electoris vote for? Not alwayis. Do voteris isometimeis get confuised about the electoris and vote for the wrong candidate? isometimeis."" If the electoris are the oneis chooising who the next preisident iis going to be, then there iis no reaison why the people are voting if their voteis don't count. The people are not able to decide whom their next preisident iis going to be. Moreover, who are theise iso called electoris? Stated in isource 2 under ""What'is wrong with the electoral college"" it talkis about whom the electoris are. The article isayis "" Back in 1960, isegragationiistisin the Louiisiana legiislature nearly isucceede in replacing the Democratic electoris with new electoris who would oppoise Jonh F. Kennedy.

"  A Blueprint for Sustainable Urbanism  In an age marked by rapid urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a visionary approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a groundbreaking perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Dear, Mr.Mrs. Florida state senator I am writing to you about the Electoral College and i would like to share my opions with you. As we know the Electoral College chooses the president by having 538 electors and the winning president must have at least 270 electoral votes to claim the presidency. States get a number of electoral voters and depending on the size of the state depends how many voters that state gets, bigger states get more electoral voters and smaller states for example Rhode Island get less. The way the Electoral College is set up it seems that the menwomen running for presidency would try to get the minds of the bigger states with more electoral voters to choose them so they can reach the 270 mark. It is clear to me that we have done it this way ever since the founding fathers created it. Its time for a change, the Electoral College is out of date and needs to be replaced with popular vote. Lets not forget the 2000 election when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost because of the Electoral College, Al Gore quite frankly should have won, I mean he did have more votes.

The Electoral College is a system that doesn work, popular vote on the other hand does work. If the United States of America wants a ""fair"" election then we should give them one with the popular vote. It is simple and easy to understand, the madwoman with the most votes wins the presidency. Its time to let the Electoral College go byebye, the 538 electoral voters need to leave and make room for a more efficient election. Most Americans are done with the ""winnertakeall"" style, if we can let the Electoral College go we can have more ""fair"" elections, not ""winnertakeall"" elections. Sometimes though even the electoral voters don't even vote for who won that state they also vote for whom they want to be president. The Electoral College is not efficient, in ""1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election,"" and again in 1976 a tie could have happened if some voters voted the other way, in that case they were only a few votes away from a disaster. If we have the popular vote then candidates would try to get everyone from every state, but with the Electoral College some candidates dont even visit a state or a region they know they won't win over. So that means they will try the bigger states or a region they came from with that said its unfair to the voters.

The Electoral College is a good way for the voters within the college to cheat their way into having the candiate they want to win, win. So if this country wants a more fair vote every four years on a Tuesday after the first Monday then we must have popular vote.

I hope you will take my facts and opions into consideration and give it time to think and discuss what you think, but if everyone wants a more fair election I say we give them one.

Thank you for your time, from: a student from a high school.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passage set provides several examples of the positive impacts of reducing car dependence, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a shift towards more sustainable and inclusive transportation systems.

One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. The passages highlight the substantial role that cars play in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the figure can reach up to 50%. This is a significant contribution to climate change and air pollution. By reducing car usage, we can decrease carbon emissions and improve air quality, creating a healthier environment for everyone.

Another advantage of limited car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. The passage set showcases examples from different countries, such as the car-free day in Bogota and the transformation of suburbs in Germany to be more accessible to public transportation. These initiatives encourage the use of buses, bikes, and walking, which are more sustainable and can help to reduce traffic congestion. By providing better infrastructure and incentives for using these modes of transport, we can create more efficient and accessible urban environments.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog mentions that congestion decreased by 60%. This implies that reducing car usage can improve traffic flow and decrease commuting times, leading to increased productivity and economic efficiency. Furthermore, there can be cost savings for individuals who rely less on cars. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that 70% of families in the community do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. This suggests that households can save money by not having to maintain and fuel cars, and instead use more cost-effective transportation options.

While there may be concerns about the impact of limiting car usage on personal mobility and convenience, the passage set suggests that these challenges can be mitigated. The introduction of car-sharing programs and the development of better public transportation systems provide viable alternatives to car ownership. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as carpooling apps and bike-sharing programs, make these alternative modes of transportation more accessible and convenient.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, ranging from environmental benefits and reduced greenhouse gas emissions to improved traffic flow and economic efficiency. By promoting alternative transportation modes and investing in sustainable infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly communities.",1
"Florida Senator I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appalled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitutiondecades ago. The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical. I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential candidate, they are not. Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president. Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions? Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives candidates different motives for their campaign. I believe that in an electoral campaign, candidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting. However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by candidates, as if they don't matter, so that the candidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from. In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the candidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad. If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded? It makes sense for the candidates to see ""swing states""the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another. I don't blame the candidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting. For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which candidate the state's electoral votes will be going to. People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way. The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting. Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, onehalf of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not. I'm sure that a good portion of nonvoters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issuesissues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system. Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place. With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. One example of a community that has successfully implemented this concept is Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, cars are not allowed on the streets except for a few main thoroughfares and designated parking areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars to move to this car-free community (Rosenthal, 2009). This experiment in low-car suburban life is part of a larger trend in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world to separate suburbs from excessive car usage (Rosenthal, 2009). 

The reduction of car usage in suburbs is crucial as it directly addresses the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with passenger cars accounting for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car usage in suburbs, we can make a significant impact in reducing these emissions.

One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the potential for more sustainable transportation options. In Vauban, for example, the community is designed in a way that promotes walking and biking. Stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located on distant highways (Rosenthal, 2009). This kind of smart planning not only reduces the need for cars, but also encourages healthier and more active lifestyles.

Limiting car usage also has positive impacts on congestion and air pollution. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog caused by excessive car emissions. The ban led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and significantly improved air quality in the city (Duffer, 2014). This demonstrates the immediate benefits that can be achieved by reducing car usage in densely populated areas.

Furthermore, car-free initiatives such as the annual car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, have been successful in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Selsky, 2002). These initiatives not only improve air quality, but also help to create a sense of community by encouraging people to engage in activities such as hiking, biking, and skating together.

The shift away from car culture is not limited to specific areas or communities. Studies in the United States have shown a decrease in the number of miles driven per person, suggesting that Americans are driving less and potentially reaching a point of peak driving (Rosenthal, 2013). This shift in behavior has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions from transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting sustainable transportation options, reducing congestion and air pollution, and fostering a sense of community. Initiatives such as car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days are just a few examples of how this concept is being implemented around the world. As we continue to make progress in limiting car usage, we move closer to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1
"  A Vision of Sustainable Urban Transformation  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and environmental challenges, the concept of car-free cities is gaining traction as a revolutionary approach to reenvision urban living. Car-free cities advocate for a paradigm shift where private automobiles are either drastically restricted or entirely eliminated, making way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a more eco-friendly urban environment. This essay delves into the idea of car-free cities, focusing on their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities represent a vision of urban living that champions sustainability, public health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a crucial role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, addressing the pressing issue of climate change.  Public Health: These cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents.  Optimal Space Utilization: Car-free cities efficiently repurpose urban space by converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a significant financial burden. By relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, contributing to their overall financial well-being.  However, transitioning to car-free cities poses a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities. Substantial investments are needed to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions for the successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"In Vauban, Germany, citizens have made the decision to not use cars. To some people, this may be something that they could never imagine themselves doing, because it would make life more complicated. However, these people are pleased with their decision and would not have it any other way. Furthermore, there are many advantages to making this change. By limiting car usage, citizens can improve their own health and economic state.

By making the decision to stop using cars, one can become healthier, both mentally and physically. One citizen who has already taken this step said,""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal 3. Many people who chose to limit their car usage, decided to walk or ride bikes instead. By chosing the alternative, they are less stressed. There is something soothing about walking down the road in a quiet and peaceful environment. Walking gives one time to reflect and think, while driving requires concentration and can be stressful. In addition to improving one's mental health, limiting car usage can also improve one's physical health. Pollution from the air can take a toll on someone's physical health and the environment around them. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Rosenthal 5. Pollution poisons the air of most cities where people live and breathing the pollution is not healthy for an individual. In cities like Beijing, inhabitants wear air filters over their mouths in hopes fo escaping the pollution. Limiting car usage can help improve air quality quickly. For example, after having multiple days of intense smog, Paris decided to ban cars with evennumbered plates for one day. After this one day of limited car usage, ""the smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday"" Duffer 19.

Another advantage to limiting cars is that it could mean economic improvement for individuals and countries. The banning of cars can mean improvement in the appearance of cities, which can have positive impacts on the economy of cities. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have beeen replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" Selsky 28. These improvements in the city can draw more people to them and stimulate the economy in places that have had difficulty before. In addition, individuals can save money by carpooling, biking, walking, or using public transit as an alternative optopn to driving. During the 2013 rececession, people were forced to sell their cars due to lack of money. However, after they recovered from this, they decided not to return to car usage due to their content in the lifestyle they had chosen Rosenthal 32 In conclusion, limiting one's usage of cars can have only positive impacts on one's life. This decision can have lasting impacts one's happiness, the environment, and the economy.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for individuals and the community as a whole. The passage set provides evidence of this trend happening in different parts of the world, including Germany, France, and Colombia. In these places, efforts have been made to reduce the dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to a cleaner environment, healthier individuals, and better community planning.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution being released into the environment. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where air pollution can have severe health consequences for residents.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on individual health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on that particular day. Engaging in physical activity like walking or cycling instead of driving can help improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness. It can also reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to better community planning and more efficient land use. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes a community where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. Instead, emphasis is placed on public transportation and walking. This approach makes it easier for people to access amenities and services on foot and reduces the need for large parking lots and sprawling developments. Compact and walkable communities can promote social interaction, reduce traffic congestion, and improve quality of life.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have a range of advantages for both individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote physical activity and better health, and lead to more efficient community planning. As the passages suggest, these efforts are already being implemented in different parts of the world. It is important for individuals to consider alternative modes of transportation and make choices that contribute to a cleaner and healthier future.",1
"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."", stated David Goldberg, according to author Elisabeth Rosenthal. Fellow citizens, the time has come to address the complications of our over usage of cars. There are many advantages to limiting car usage that you need to take into consideration. Less stress, reduced air pollution, and less money spent on such a worthless form of transportation. Sounds like an intriguing advantage, right?!

First off, stress can be caused greatly by cars. Although, this may sound absurd, just put some thought into it. With a limit on car usage, you hardly have to worry about your kid crossing the street by themselves. Say bye bye, to car hijackers! They are no longer a problem, neither is getting in an accident. Stop worrying, because do to the limit on car usage, your chances of caos are finite, they are no longer limitless.

Furthermore, air pollution is a big economic problem today. Limiting car usage means a great deal of air pollution reduction. In article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", we see congestion was down 60 percent, after five days, five days alone! Can you imagine how much better our health would be? We see many cases of lung cancer, due to smoke in the lungs, putting a limit on many lives. Also, air pollution is as well bed for mother nature herself, killing trees, our vital resource we not only rely on to put a roof over our heads, but also our whole source of living. Air pollution, is a definite economic problem that we can get rid of simply with the reduction of car usage.

Is your money being well spent? Not really, and you can thank the monster sitting in your driving, hiding in plain site. Cars need lots of attention. We're talking about more attention than an infant! You have to provide it with insurance, monthly bills and so much more. For instance, if you were to get a flat tire, you have to replace it with a spare, tand then that flat has to also get fixed. Money, money, and more money just being stolen right from under your nose, while gas prises are piling higher!

To conclude, if you were to limit your car usage you shall find many advantages, not only for you but for the economy. Stress, is a never ending cycle with the hunk of parts you may call your, ""friend"". A reduction in air pollution has a great amount of benefits. Next time, you decide to take a ride out with your buddies in your car, take a nice good thought about all the exhaust possibly filling up your lungs, and if not yours then someone else's. Lastly, you no longer will have to worry about your money jumping out your pocket.",0
"Dear State Senator, ""The Electoral college is a process not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" I do not thing think this is the best method of voting on the next President for our Country. I feel this way because the people of America do not really make the decision of who becomes President their vote just goes to a slate of electors. People may say that the Electoral College is fair but some of the biggest states only vote on democratic or republican candidates and thats not fair at all.

The first reason I think the Electoral college should be abolished is because the deciding factor of who becomes Americas President doesn't come from the people it comes from the Electoral college. Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for the President but for a slate of electors. The election process should be changed to ""election by popular vote."" Another reason I think we shouldn't use the electoral college is because some states are biased towards certain political groups so say California wanted a democrat to be President that person would receive 55 electoral votes from just one state! Many states that don't have as many electoral votes may not even get to see the candidates because they only care about the larger states. For instance, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The third reason I think we should let the outcome be decided by the American people and not electoral colleges is because the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California.",0
"Dear State Senator, Many people go back and forth whether or not to keep the Electoral College or switching to popular vote to decide on who our President of the United States will be. The Electoral College just isn't a fair way in deciding who the President will be. Just because that canident won the Electoral College and not the most popular vote out of the whole country, does not mean that should be President.

The picture provided in source 3 shows a map of the ""breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state."" Throughout the map you can clearly see that each state does not have the same number of electoral votes as all the rest. When people go out to elect the President they have to understand that they might not be in control of that vote honestly counting. We basically aren't choosing the President we want. We are choosing the electors for that President who will be voting for you and the state. It's sad to see that even if a President does win the popular vote out of the whole country that they still, may not become President because of the electoral College. It even says in source 2 paragraph 9 ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" If more people are against the Electoral College then there must be a change.

Along with people feeling as if their vote doesn't matter, there could be a ""disaster factor."" A disaster factor is when you vote for the candidates electors that then go and vote for the President of the opposite that you wanted. Yes is happens ""rarely"" but it still has happened. It says in source 2 ""back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors withnew electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" They were going to do this so that the popular vote whould not be counted for Kennedy. People have to keep in mind that if we vote for who we want as the President we are voting for electors that at any point in the election can change their mind and not vote for who you originally voted for. If electors do, do this then we have no control over it. It's like we've been told that our opinion doesn't matter or count in our country that is supposed to be free, we also have rights that prove our voice is allowed to be heard.

On the other hand like stated in source 3 people may argued that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" but then it goes further on to say ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" That statement proves that it is unfair and not right not just to the candidate but to the people who overall voted for them. It also says in source 3 that ""no region Soth Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" But it sure does play a big role in deciding whether or not the President you want to win, will win or not. Also because of states being more popular than other states the Electoral College might as well say that those states are better than others, which is not true.

Overall, the Electoral College voting method should be changed to popular vote. It will make people feel like their vote actually matters and by having a popular vote the voting throughout the whole country would be more accurate than the Electral College way. With the amount of electoral votes given to each state it isn't fair to say that each state is even. Also with the chance of a disaster factor happening, people would feel more comfortable with knowing once their vote is in it will stay that way and not be changed by something that they can't control, especially by someone else. Our voting method must change and change quick.",0
"Dear Senator, As you may know, there is a huge dilemma with the voting system we have as of right now. I am writing to you because it is in our best interest to abolish the Electoral College and change election to popular vote for the next presidential election. The reasons we should make this change is because the Electoral College is unfair for voters, also a disaster waiting to happen and the popular voting system bring so many more benefits and opportunities for the people.

The Electoral system simply takes away the people's say on who they think the best candidate is. It is simply unfair for the voters. In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a ""winnertakeall"" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.

In source two, Bradford Plumer mentions the single best argument against the Electoral College, which he calls the ""disaster factor"". Voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This means that voters dont really have control on who they vote for, as mentioned before. The Electors can defy the will of the people, the only reason people vote, in this system, is to ""sway the opinion"". This is known as the ""disaster factor"", the electors defying the will of the people. Another problem with this system is that if there is a tie, it is definately out of the peoples choice. The decision is left to the House Of Representatives. The Electoral College is a disaster waiting to happen, like a bomb ticking, at some point in time, it will explode.

The benefits of switching to popular vote really pays off. With popular vote, these issues adressed would not be a problem at all, such as the unfairness to voters, the disasters awaiting to happen with the Electoral College. The only downside to this is that it will take a little longer to count the votes and finalize the election, but it is worth it. All voters would be at peace of mind knowing that their vote actually counted for something. In my opinion, this is the best choice and option out there. We need to get rid of the Electoral College because it brings us no good at all. We could finally stop worrying about the timer!

I hope you take this into consideration.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Consideration of Election by Popular Vote

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, it is vital that we critically evaluate the merits of both the current system and the possible alternative of a popular vote. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I assert that it is crucial to maintain the Electoral College system.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner. While disputes can arise, it is less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. In fact, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures a clear winner and minimizes the possibility of unresolved disputes.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system preserves the principle of ""everyone's president."" Judge Posner's argument highlights the importance of a president having trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are compelled to campaign across the country, ensuring that they represent and consider the interests of all regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected, thus promoting a more unified and effective leadership.

Another key advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. As pointed out by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on competitive states. This ensures that voters in these states are more engaged and informed about the candidates and their policies, making them more thoughtful and influential in the election process. The emphasis on swing states ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on strongholds but must appeal to a broader range of voters.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that all states, regardless of size, have a say in the election of the president. As Judge Posner notes, the electoral process restores some balance to the political weight of large states that lose representation in the Senate due to population mal-apportionment. This prevents smaller states from being marginalized and encourages presidential candidates to pay attention to their interests, providing a more equitable representation for all Americans.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process. As highlighted by Judge Posner, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even when candidates do not receive a majority of the popular vote. This streamlines the election process and ensures a swift transition of power.

While there are valid arguments in favor of a popular vote, such as increased voter participation, the Electoral College system offers practical advantages that cannot be overlooked. It promotes certainty, trans-regional appeal, engagement in swing states, representation for all states, and streamlined elections. By maintaining the Electoral College, we preserve the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic process.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views on this matter. I trust that you will give careful consideration to the arguments presented and make a decision that reflects the best interests of our nation. I look forward to your continued leadership and dedication to serving our state and country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as promote healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. This essay will explore these advantages in more detail.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage set, passenger cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. For example, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and air quality improved.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, after power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health. In the example of Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents report being happier and less tense without the need to rely on cars for transportation. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to overall well-being and improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activity, such as walking or cycling. In the passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day. This event aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By encouraging active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, individuals can improve their physical fitness and reduce the risk of health problems associated with sedentary lifestyles.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable communities. The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" describes how the community of Vauban in Germany is an example of ""smart planning"" to separate suburban life from car use. This concept is being adopted globally to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. By placing stores within walking distance and promoting public transportation, communities can reduce the need for cars, decrease traffic congestion, and create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in various contexts. To achieve these advantages, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, and to plan communities that support these options.",1
"Dear State Senator, I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the preiident of the United Statei and I know I'm not alone on thii one. ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all, in their life time agreed on? Aniwer: Aboliihing the electoral college!"" That'i not enough well, ""Over 60 percent of voteri would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" 60 percent ii more than a half, now it iayi over 60 percent which would be pait 60 percent. Remember the diiaiter factor , it ii unfair to voteri, and what if there ii a tie in the electoral vote.

Firit of all, leti juit take it into thought that it ii unfair to voteri. How? Well, ""Beacuie of the iyitem winnertakeall iyitem in each itate, candidatei don't ipend time in itatei they know they have no chance in winning, focuiing only on the tight racei in the ""iwing"" itate."" In 2000, the campaign that wai going on, well 17 itatei did not iee the candidatei at all. Alio, including Rhode Iiland and South Carolina. What about the fact that, ""Voteri in 25 of the largeit media marketi didn't get to iee a iingle campaign ad."" Not even one. Some might iay that it doein't matter if they have a campaign ad or not, believe me, I've heard it before. Having a campaign ad ihowi people what you want to do, how you want to help, how you want to make a change, ect... I don't underitand how unfair it can be to people.

Second of all, what would happen if there wai a tie in the electoral vote? Well then, the election would be paiied to the Houie Of Repreientativei, itate delegation vote on the preiident.

"The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a ""Winnertakesall"" system. This unnecessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down.

In an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party. This is a completely unfair use of power because it reverses all of the votes that went to the elector and to all of the voters who were counting on the elector to properly represent their vote. The voters have no say in whether the elector will stay true to his or her party.

The easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. In source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College it states ""over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Multiple icons such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO have stated they would like to abolish the electoral college as well! We now have the majority vote to put an end to the electoral college and the unfair system.

""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,"" says source 2. A tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of America to rest in the hands of the House of Representatives, a miniscule representation of the people. If the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of America chose.

""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is ""a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner "".",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement is driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life in urban areas. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage, including the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital city of Colombia, Bogota.

The German suburb of Vauban serves as an example of the benefits of limiting car usage. In this suburb, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and car ownership is allowed but limited. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move there. One resident of Vauban expressed her happiness with this lifestyle change, stating that she is much happier without a car and that having a car always made her feel tense. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to increased happiness and reduced stress for individuals.

Similarly, the city of Paris implemented a partial driving ban in response to severe smog pollution. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city. This shows that limiting car usage can have a tangible impact on reducing pollution and improving air quality. It is worth noting that exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers, indicating that alternative forms of transportation are encouraged.

In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. The event was a success, with millions of Colombians choosing to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work. This led to the streets of Bogota being devoid of traffic jams for a day. The mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, attended the event and praised the efforts of the people of Bogota in generating a revolutionary change. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can inspire other cities and countries to adopt similar measures and make a positive impact on transportation and the environment.

These examples highlight the advantages of limiting car usage. By reducing the number of cars on the road, greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States. Limiting car usage also improves air quality and reduces congestion in urban areas, leading to a better quality of life for residents. Additionally, promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, contributes to a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and reducing congestion. Examples from around the world, such as the German suburb Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital city of Bogota, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. By adopting similar measures and promoting alternative forms of transportation, cities and communities can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"  Revolutionizing Urban Living  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and increasing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities is emerging as an innovative approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban life. These cities propose a profound shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, prioritizing sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the key benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By emphasizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Furthermore, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"The Electoral College. The system that our founding fathers had set for us to choose a leader of this country. It has been used forever and some poeple may agree that we should keep it. But others understand that we should change the voting system so that the election is more fair. I believe that the United States should no longer use the Electoral College to elect our president because I feel that we should have a more direct vote so that the person that most people actually want in office will be elected and so that all of the states can hear each candidates campaign so they feel like their vote actually takes part in the election.

To begin with, I believe that the United States should start to use a direct vote to choose our leader so that the winner of the popular vote actually gets to win and so that the peoples votes actually matter. It seems only fair that if you win the popular vote from everyone one in the country that you should win the race but with using the Electoral College the decision will always vary. For example, during Al Gore vs Bush, Gore had over 60% of the nations vote. Most of the people wanted him as our acting president. But due to the Electoral College Bush ended up winning the election. If the people actually did have a say then Gore wouldve been elected because of the popular vote. When using the Electoral College your vote wouldnt be apart of the actual election. Your supposed to elect an elector to vote for you. So truly your elector has all the power because in the end they are the one choosing who your state has voted for.

Furthermore, the Electoral College shouldn be used to elect our president because it makes it unfair to voters. With the winnertakeall system in each state the candidates dont spend time to try and campaign in all of the states because they think they have no chance of winning in that state. Every state should be able to see the campaigns for each of the candidates so they can have an actual choice. If campaigners spend most of their time focused on the swing states how would they know if they had a chance of winning over any other state that they thought wouldnt vote for them. For example, back in 2000 seventeen states didnt see any of the candidates or a single campaign ad. That is basically telling that state that their vote doesnt matter.

In conclusion, The Electoral College has major flaws in it that are easily exploited. The people dont get to vote for themselves, instead they put their vote in the hands of an elector who, in the end, has the final say on who the state votes for. Also the Electoral College, which has a winnertakeall system, excludes some of the states from actually seeing a candidate which makes it seem like their vote is irrelevant to the whole election.",0

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator’s Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While I understand that some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial safeguard that ensures fair representation and prevents potential crises that could arise from a direct popular vote.

Firstly, the Electoral College system was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. As stated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process allows for the selection of electors, the meeting where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors, with at least 270 electoral votes required to elect the President. This process ensures that each state has a voice in determining the outcome of the election, as the number of electors is based on the state’s congressional delegation, providing representation for both populous and less populated states (Office of the Federal Register, 1-3).

One of the key benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. In a direct popular vote, disputes over close margins in the popular vote could lead to lengthy legal battles and uncertainty. However, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote, minimizing the potential for disputed results (Posner, 18). This stability is critical to maintaining public confidence in the election process.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the concept of “everyone’s President” by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country holds enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and address the needs and concerns of diverse regions. In this way, the system ensures that the elected president has a broad understanding of the nation's interests and does not simply cater to one particular region (Posner, 19).

Additionally, the Electoral College’s focus on swing states allows for more thoughtful and engaged voters. As mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner, swing states receive more attention from candidates, leading voters in these states to pay closer attention to campaign messages. These voters are more likely to listen and evaluate the candidates' positions, resulting in well-informed decisions (Posner, 20). This ensures that states with a variety of political perspectives have an opportunity to shape the outcome of the election.

In relation to the concern about big states potentially dominating the election process, the Electoral College helps balance the political weight between large and small states. It allows large states to have greater influence while preventing certain regions from being disproportionately powerful. The electoral votes are proportionate to each state's population, ensuring that candidates give due consideration to both large and small states during their campaigns (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College method avoids run-off elections that could complicate and prolong the presidential election process. It eliminates the need for additional votes or run-off elections when no candidate secures an absolute majority. This streamlined process promotes continuity and efficiency in determining the president-elect (Posner, 22).

While some critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in non-competitive states from voting, statistics show that approximately half of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections. Voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preference rather than the belief that their single vote will sway the entire election (Posner, 23).

In conclusion, the Electoral College system stands as a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures that every state has a voice in electing the President, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids potential run-off elections. The Electoral College is a time-tested system that has provided stability and fairness to the presidential election process for over two centuries.

Therefore, I urge you to consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College and to vote in favor of maintaining this crucial institution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Car's. relied on by many people. Used to go anywhere and everywhere. They are comfortable and cool to look at, but are they really as great as everyone think's they are? They pollute, they cause accident's, they destroy the environment and they cost a lot of money and sometimes it's more then people have. Yes, car's make everything easier for you but what happens when there is a bad traffic day and you are already late to work. sometimes car's arent always a great thing.

Gas. The first thing I think of when I hear about car's. They put so many toxin's in to the air that can kill everything around them. In the article it talk's about Paris banning car driving due to the fact that the smog or gas coming from the car's was becoming unbareable. Congestion was down 60% due to the fact that the smog had intensified. Beijing, China happens to be the one of the most polluted cities in the world due to car's. The fuel in car's is pushed out the exhaust pipe when the car is driving which then pollute's the air which make's it hard for thing's that need air such as the surrounding animal's, plant's and human's such as our self's.

Another thing that cause's problem's with car's is the fact that traffic jam's and accident's that are just waiting to happen at any moment. Someone who doesn't know how to drive very well hit's someone else and it cause's an accident leaving people hurt. Not to mention the stress and the road rage that driving put's on people. Going outside and walking to work or going to the park with out all the problem's of being stuck in a car and enjoying the fresh air is a great way to start any day. On the day that Bogota, Colombia decided to have a carfree day people had hiked, biked,skated,and walked. These are thing's that I'm sure people wouldn't have done if they were still allowed to still drive their car.

How would car's drive if they didn't have the road's that we build? How do the road's get there? They get put down where there used to be tree's and land. People destroy and take apart the earth and the put down road's and building's. What do people plan to do when they have taken down all the tree's and used all the space that the earth has to offer? There will be nothing left. Car's are great and all, I understand that they are fast and they make life simplier but people are getting lazy and they are starting to not care about their surrounding's and it's sad.

Car's are not cheap. They take time and money. When a car has a problem or break's down you have to pay to get it fixed. You have to pay to put gas in your car and depending on how much gas your car need's, it can put a hole in your wallet. Car's. We use them, rely on them to take us where we want to go, use them for entertainment such as Nascar and Monster Truck's. One day all the car's will be gone and then what will the world do.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College or Transition to Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my views regarding the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. As an informed citizen and constituent, I have carefully considered the information from various sources, including the texts provided, and I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures certainty of outcome. In the current system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of disputes over the election outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and his opponent. Furthermore, with almost all states using a winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Another crucial advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes a president who has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, forcing candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This system ensures that the president represents the interests of various regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also engenders the sentiment that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Moreover, the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates focus their efforts on these states, which can translate into increased voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making. Swing states, therefore, play a crucial role in determining the election outcome, as voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the weight of political influence between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as prescribed in the Constitution, disadvantages large states in terms of their representation. However, the Electoral College partially rectifies this discrepancy by rewarding larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This way, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and issues facing both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system provides an effective means of avoiding run-off elections. It ensures that a clear winner is always declared, preventing the need for additional elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This feature streamlines the presidential election process and reduces complexity and potential complications.

While advocates for a direct popular vote argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic, the information provided in the texts demonstrates that the system has practical benefits and aligns with key democratic principles. The Electoral College ensures certainty, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages meaningful voter participation, balances political influence, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly support maintaining the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. It serves as a vital mechanism for ensuring fair and representative elections. I kindly request that you consider these perspectives when determining your position on this matter.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, including Europe, the United States, and Colombia. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting alternative modes of transportation. By examining examples from Germany, France, and Colombia, as well as recent studies on shifting American behavior, it becomes evident that limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduced Environmental Impact

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are mainly caused by passenger cars. According to the article, automobiles account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas of the United States. By promoting car-free communities and compact suburbs, the reliance on cars can be reduced, leading to a decrease in emissions. For example, Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen a decrease in car ownership, with 70 percent of families not owning cars. This reduction in car usage directly contributes to a decrease in emissions.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Quality of Life

Aside from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can greatly enhance individuals' quality of life. The article highlights how residents of the car-free community in Vauban, Germany, have reported higher levels of happiness and reduced stress levels since giving up their cars. Walking and cycling become a more prevalent means of transportation, creating a healthier and more active lifestyle. By relying less on cars, people can enjoy cleaner and quieter streets, free from the noise and pollution associated with heavy traffic.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Urban Planning

Limiting car usage also encourages urban planning that is conducive to walking, cycling, and public transportation. Instead of building sprawling suburbs with extensive parking spaces, new developments are being designed to prioritize accessibility and proximity to public transportation and amenities. This approach can create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods where stores, parks, and cultural institutions are within walking distance. By reducing the need for cars, space previously allocated for parking lots can be repurposed for green spaces, bike lanes, and community gathering areas.

Conclusion:

The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and extend beyond individual benefits to encompass environmental, societal, and urban planning advantages. By adopting a more sustainable approach to transportation, cities and suburbs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve overall quality of life, and create more walkable and vibrant communities. The success of car-free communities in Germany, the implementation of driving restrictions in Paris, and the popularity of car-free days in Bogota demonstrate the feasibility and positive outcomes of limiting car usage. As attitudes towards car ownership shift and alternative modes of transportation gain popularity, it is imperative that societies embrace these changes and continue to prioritize sustainable and smart planning principles.",1
"  Pioneering Sustainable Urban Paradigms  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Dear Senator, The Electoral College should not be the deciding vote for the president of the United States of America. Every popular vote of the people should be counted towards deciding the next president. If America is a democracy and in a democracy people pick the leader then every citizen's vote should count, not just the majority.

First things first, only a few states have taken action towards my claim. Those being Maine and Nebraska. These states have made a ""proportional representation"", which is unlike the ""winner take all"" that the other 48 states have adopted. The text states ""Most states have a winner take all method system that awards all electorss to the winning presidential candidate"" What Is the Electoral College?7.This portrays that with the ""winner take all"" method various amounts of U.S. citizen votes have gone unaccounted for.

Multiple occasions have dimmed the surface of our elections where their voices aren't heard. The author says ""faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" Plumer 11. Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people's votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electorsal votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of representatives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close.

On the other hand, it is much harder to calculate the total number of the popular vote being that there are millions of people voting. It is much easier to count and not dispute over a hundred or so votes than a million. But, having people know that their vote doesn't make it to actually voting for the president makes them not as enthusiastic about voting. The text says ""no voter's vote swings an election""Posner 23. This explains why only about one half of eligible American voters voted.

In conclusion, America is a democracy, which means people elect the president, not a electors but the people. The author states ""The electorsal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Plumer 14. This further explains that electorss cannot make decisions without being biased toward their party. Also portraying well, the feelings of many Americans who feel the same way.",0

Subject: The Electoral College vs. Election by Popular Vote

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is [Your Name], and I am a concerned citizen of [State]. I am writing to express my views on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the following reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes over the outcome, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, minimizing the likelihood of protracted disputes. Although the popular vote winner may not always win the presidency, such instances have been scarce throughout history. The rarity of such occurrences suggests that the Electoral College generally reflects the will of the people and produces an undisputed outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" In an era of increasing regionalism, it is essential that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College forces candidates to campaign beyond their solid regional bases and appeals to voters from different regions. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a few concentrated areas. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from becoming presidents, this system promotes unity and a balanced representation of diverse perspectives.

Moreover, the focus on swing states in presidential campaigns, thanks to the winner-take-all method, ensures that voters in these states receive special attention. Swing states often play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of elections, leading to greater voter engagement and informed decision-making. By allocating campaign efforts to these states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address issues that are important to swing state voters, resulting in a more thoughtful and well-informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed by the Constitution, grants small states more influence in the political process than their population would suggest. The Electoral College further amplifies this balance by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are heard and considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College allows for clear winners and avoids the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can significantly complicate the election process. The Electoral College, by design, leads to a clear winner who secures the majority of the electoral votes. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and ensures a swift, decisive outcome for the nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and balanced system for electing the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes the concept of ""everyone's president,"" encourages voter engagement in swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. While concerns about fairness and representation are valid, the Electoral College continues to be a necessary compromise that merits preservation.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views on this important matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation. I look forward to witnessing the positive outcomes that the Electoral College can continue to deliver in our democratic process.

Sincerely,

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After carefully analyzing the information presented in various texts, I am convinced that the Electoral College should be retained for several reasons, despite some valid concerns that have been raised.

One of the key arguments in favor of keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This means that the Electoral College system reduces the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an election, as the winner's mandate is clear. In contrast, a popular vote system could potentially result in closer margins and more disputes over the legitimacy of the election, as exemplified by the 2000 presidential election.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as explained by Judge Posner. This system requires a candidate to have support from multiple regions throughout the country to secure victory. This avoids a situation where a candidate only appeals to one particular region, which would result in other regions feeling disenfranchised and marginalized. The Electoral College promotes a more inclusive presidency that considers the interests of a diverse range of regions.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. According to Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign in states where the election outcome is uncertain. This leads to more focused and targeted campaigns that take into account the concerns and issues of voters in these crucial states. Swing states have a significant impact in deciding the election, and this system encourages candidates to engage with voters in those states, thereby giving them a voice in the election process.

In addition, the Electoral College balances the representation of big states and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance, considering the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of voters in both large and small states, instead of solely focusing on the interests of highly populated areas. The Electoral College system promotes a more equitable distribution of political attention and resources.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid run-off elections. As noted by Judge Posner, the Electoral College allows for a clear winner to emerge, even if a candidate does not secure a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the need for additional rounds of elections and the associated complications that come with it. The Electoral College ensures that the election process remains streamlined and efficient.

While there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College system, such as the winner-take-all system and the potential for faithless electors, the advantages outlined above make a compelling case for retaining this system. It provides certainty, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balanced representation of states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the benefits that the Electoral College brings to the presidential election process. It provides stability, representation, and fairness to voters across different regions of our nation. I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved, as it has proven to be an effective compromise between direct popular vote and election by Congress. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

"Dear senator , I know befor you were senator you voted just like us and you know how frustrating it can be somethings. The Electoral Collage would be discarded and Presidents of the united states should be elected by popular vote. If we do the popular vote it will be more efficient and be easier to keep track of. We have to do it because The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , the masses the people don't get to pick the president, and its outdated.

Firstly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it has failed to elect a President in the past. In the case of a tie in electoral votes it would be the task of the house of representatives the elect a president and the way they elect the president is worse then the electoral collage. even thought and exact tie in the presidential elections has not occored so the catostrify of the house of representatives electing the president has not happen yet ,but it is entirely possible.

Secondly, we need to abolish the Electoral collage because the masses the people don't get to the president. In the electoral collage usage of the system results in the People electing the electors ,to elect the president. And in this system the electors can pull a switcheroo and vote for the other canadent if they so please, to betray the people by doing so. allthought its system has worked scince the founding of our country ,it is still quirky and disfunctionable at times. the electoral collage allows the electors to do as they please if a elector for florida promises to pick one president and gets all the votes to got to the electoral collage he can choose the Other canadent because his friend wanted him to. how stupid is that!

Thirdly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it is outdated. in our day and time we have smart phones and androids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the computer can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its also outdated because we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.

In conclusion, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it can fail to elect a presidentwhich is almost did in 1960, the masses the people can't elect the presidentthey have to elect the electors to elect the president, and also is is very outdated. in my opion, we should also consider tweking the electoral callage instead of just getting rid of it.",0
"In my opinion, I think that the Electoral College method should be abolished, because with it the Presidential elections are quite useless. I'm specifically talking about the way Presidents get popular votes. The system is very outdated and very irrational. When the Founding fathers founded this country, they said that the ""People of America"" get a voice and say in everything, well, not everything. But still their own say during the presidential Elections are useless, the only real true thing to do is vote for the Senate Electors for the Presidential elections since the Electoral College process is mainly controlled by the Senate, the Senators vote for the Presidential candidate. You see, the only way candidates actually win the every 4 year elections in November is by the amount of votes they get, by NOT the people, but by the Senators that pledged with them during the Electoral College. In this essay I'll explain why this system is to bad for our today's world and how it can lead to false moves and corruption.

First off, is what's exactly the Electoral College? It's not a place, it's more like a process of choosing and voting for a Presidential candidate. You see the votes that regular U.S citizens do, do not count as the actual votes, though back then the system did work it doesn't today. Back then around the 18th and mid 19th century, this Electoral College system worked outstanding for it's time, mainly because at first America was a new country, and the Senate that did do the voting and choosing were well educated and have experience. Most citizens in the American States weren't really that educated very well, mostly for new borns since the nation just finished their revolution and they were still in debt at the time, and so not everybody was rich enough to afford anything, in turn they have no knowledge of the way the world now works. Then during the civil war, half the country became another country known as the confederate States of America, which opposed the ideals of a more freer nation of other half of the country, known as the United States of America. The Electoral College did help President Abe to be elected, though it was mainly because he was popular since he used the ideal of abolishing and freeing slaves to gain populraity. And alot of people opposed him to become President, but thanks to the College process he won the Elections, and reunited the two nations into the United States of America.

So, does this will in today's world? No, abosolutely not, it doesn't work, and will never work unless America gets 1984'ed and become a false and brainwashed Utopia. Due to our general corrupt society, the right President's get denied, and the corrupt and wrongful citizen gets elected. I can relate this issue with the 2000 Presidential Election crisis. In the 2000 elections, Al Gore gets the most popular votes, infact so much more then George Bush, that it was clear he can easily win the 2004 elections. But since the Electoral College is still intact, they voted for George Bush, and Bush won the elections by 5 more votes then the popular and better organized President, Al Gore. Because of this, most of America got an economy train wreck from in 20072008 and also wasted many resources on a the War on Terror battle from 2003, which is now gone and has a similar operation that is still ongoing called Operation Enduring Freedom. Also unlike the old times when America was a new country, in today's modern 21st Century America, I can assure you that we have 95% percent of the Population educated by our today's educational standards tops. Which means that America doesn't need a hand when voting for a new President, and that shows that the Electoral College is not needed anymore, anytime. The Governments and it's people today are also very corrupt at times. This will also include the Electoral College, and can affect many lives for many people. Everybody can now make their own choice thanks to our very effective education system. So this proves the College group is now useless for voting.

Finally that's why we should abolish like Bob Dole said, it can cause a lots of corruption, and was only made for it's time since at that time many people were uneducated and couldn't even read, and now a day's today's society is very well off on educated minds. And has enough corruption as it is. And so that's the nutshell of this essay, and this is why we should remove the Electoral College. As its unfair and unfit for today's world and society of the American Government.",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"", as said in source one, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

One of the main reasons the pollution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.

Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraints and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , ""These people are generating a revolutionary change."" Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the environment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to exercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.

Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.

So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the environment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to exercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.",0
"Dear senator, We should change the electoral college to an election by popular votes for the president of the united states.

I believe that everyone should have a say in who their future president should be not just a group of selected officials. Sure some of the peoples choices may end up bias or thoughtless but atleast they get to feel as if their a part of the state. like stated in ""what's wrong with the electoral college"" sentence 11 ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" meaning that sometimes the chosen electors neglect their positions and use it the wrong way. The selected electors may end up going against the people andor choose a bias decision. No matter how you look at it their still human and they will make mistakes.

Electoral college shouldn't only allow government official or ""qualified"" citizens to bare that huge responsibility because if they make one wrong move then everyone will blame them but if we have popular vote everyone will have a say in the presidential voting. If we have electoral votes your only giving specific people power while as the other citizens sit down to watch complete stranges balance their countries future in their hands. like stated in ""what's wrong with electoral college"" sentence 13 ""At the most basic level ,the electoral college is unfair to voters"" meaning that electoral votes is unjustified to the people.

Electoral votes should be abolished because it isn't justified for all of those hardworking citizens who always pay their respects to this country. It even states in ""what's wrong with electoral college"" sentence 14 "" It's official : The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational."" meaning that the electoral college has been here long enough, it's not justified ,and it's irrational. Something like that should no longer exist. The citizens should have a say in who will become their new president. They should have a majority vote.

Like stated in ""choosing the president"" sentence 15 ""the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism""meaning that the electoral college is really old and we no longer have any need for it. The electoral college is something that was meant for the past. There may have been some sort of issue that they could not properly deal with ,so they created the electoral college in order to deal with it. But now we have more advance ways of doing stuff so we don't need electoral college any more. We can now change our ways for voting so that it'll match our time and period.

Electoral votes is filled with holesbias. So we should find a new way of chosing our new president who is willing to change our couontry for the best and not corrupt our country.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. As outlined in the passages, there are several reasons why reducing car dependency is essential, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of alternative transportation methods, and the improvement of quality of life.

One of the most compelling reasons to limit car usage is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars responsible for up to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even higher percentages in some car-intensive areas in the United States. These emissions have detrimental effects on the environment and contribute to climate change. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Additionally, limiting car usage can promote alternative transportation methods, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. By creating car-free areas and implementing car-reduced communities, like in the German suburb of Vauban, we can encourage people to use other modes of transportation. This not only reduces congestion and improves air quality but also fosters a sense of community and encourages physical activity. These alternative transportation methods can also be more cost-effective, as they eliminate the need for expensive car ownership and maintenance.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve quality of life. As seen in the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, removing cars from the streets can create a peaceful and less congested environment. It allows people to enjoy their surroundings without the constant noise and pollution associated with cars. This can lead to increased well-being and a greater sense of connection to the community.

It is important to note that limiting car usage does not mean eliminating cars entirely. Car ownership is still allowed in car-reduced communities, but there are limited spaces for parking. This encourages people to consider alternative modes of transportation while still providing the option for those who need or prefer to use a car.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages for society. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation methods, and improve quality of life. By adopting these measures, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Normally in everyone's mind when they are a teenager they want to have a car to go to places such as the mall, beach, etc. There are advantages though to limiting car usage. The whole planet should really hear or read about it, it's amazing to what these advantages can do for you, others, and our ecosystem.

The first of many reasons why we should limit car usage is because of greenhouse gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United StatesSource 1."" This just shows the evidence by the future if this keeps going like this the Whole entire planet would be all polluted which would make living conditions harder than they have to be. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this waySource 1."" Looking at this quote tells me that she must have been stressed with the car, maybe it was because of the traffic or the gas bill who knows, but she does feel happier without it so she must feel more at ease that her area is not cramped up with cars. In Vauban, Germany if you own a car where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner must buy a space, for 40,00, along with a home. Well sign me up with a bike or running shoes because I don't have that kind of money to spend just to live in a area with no cars.

Furthermore I would like to go to Paris, but sources state that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitalsSource 2."" Reuters had found 147 micrograms of particulate matter or PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London. That is pretty bad and knowing that people say that you must go to Paris, yeah sure for I can get polluted air into my system got it. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline."" According to Reuters ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western EuropeSource 2."" Even bogota, Columbia has a ""Carfree day"" and if you don't follow the rules of carfree day you will be fined 25. Carlos Arturo Plaza stated ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle with his wifeSource 3.

It is just clear that most areas in the world are trying to change the way we live our lives for the sake of all human life. It is a good oppurtunity to relieve stress and lower air pollution as the source stated before.",0
"Cars have been a part of our culture for some time now. Since Henry Ford created the Model T, we have been crazy about these machines. Molding, crafting, and improving since, we have come to know these as daily objects. However, with all the new and progressing theories now, is there really a need for cars? Limiting car use cold be beneficial not only for the Earth, but also for people. Limiting car use can improve people's moods, can reduce pollution, and improve community interaction.

Firstly, limiting car use could in turn improve people's moods. In Vauban, Germany, there has been an experiment of great proportion. They are living a suburban life without cars. Not only is this community close and in touch, the people are happier. As mother of two Heidrun Walter stated, ""When i had a car in was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" it is showing that not having a car can really relax a person. Just think about it, no insurance, no car payment, no thinking if wil my car last until the end of today, just saving thousands a year and having a lot of stress put off.

Secondly, limiting car use can reduce pollution. Im almost certain we've all heard about Global Warming and Greenhouse Gases, and the devastation they do to our planet. without cars these problems are still present, but lack the massive numbers in which it was rising. Smog is a horrible kind of pollution that affects the biggest cities through the world. Paris banned cars for an entire day to remove the amount of smog in the area. This shows that pollution can be stopped. Even though they only banned even numbered license plates one day and odd another pollution still went down. If all cars were banned then pollution would have gone down even further.

Lastly, limiting car use can improve community interaction. People now dont need cars for everything. They can walk, and take trains, and carpool. All these interactions strengthen the community. Walking makes people maybe wanna buy things from stores along the way and help local stores. Taking trains can create friendships and long lasting personal businesses. Carpooling city down on emissions and reduces pollution. The community can do nothing but benefit from these.

In conclusion, limiting car use could be extremely helpful. It could improve people's moods, reduce pollution, and improve community interaction. Maybe someday we could actually get rid of cars and listen to the grinding of the pedals down the biking highways.",0
"Although we rely on cars as a primary means of transportation for our busy lives there are many advantages to not using as much or even having them at all. Now driving in a car is very useful. It gets us where we want to go much faster than just biking or walking there. But there are many benefits and advantages to a world without cars. One advantage is that there will be less polution in the world. Another is that people will be just a little less lazy. And even more is that the world may be just a little quieter and safer with the lack of cars.

Thousands and thousands of people today are either driving a car or some other motorized means of transportation. And though yes they do provide a fasts way to get around, they give off so much exhaust into our relatively clean air and pollute it that its almost toxic to breathe in some places. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it says that ""After days or nearrecord polution, Paris enforced a patial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars polluted the air so badly that in some places people completly banned them all together just to rid their air of the filth that the cars had created.

Many people in the world today have gotten lazier and cars have helped them get this way. Rather than ride a bike to their destination or even walk people decide to be lazy. They drive their car there or take a bus or taxi. But if people have to get up and walk to their destination rather than just walk to their cars it will make the world just a little bit better of a place to live. There may even be less stress in the world. No waiting in traffic and no yelling at others when they cut you off or drive too slow. The only problem or stress you may have to worry about is the crowd of people you may be walking with.

Now yet another advantage to a life without cars is that it will be quieter and safer. There won't be any honking of horns in your ears. There will not be any more roars of engines. No more yelling at other drivers for their ""lack of skill"" at driving. The world will be safer as well. No more people getting hit by cars while walking and no more car accidents. No more police car chases that put innocent civilians in danger of getting hit.

There are many advantages in life with no cars. A world without cars is less polluted. A world without cars is less stressfull. and it makes the world quieter and much safer. Cars are a basic part of life and we have grown used to them but the world may be a little better if they were no longer here.",0
"Limiting car usage has lots of important advantages. By limiting car usage, we can, lower harmful greenhouse gas levels, reduce smog, and improve our environment and society. It wont happen immediately, but i do believe that if we start to limit car usage, that it will greatly benefit the world.

To begin with, cars cause a lot of the problems we are having with harmful greenhouse gas. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Paragraph 5, Source 1 Greenhouse gas emissions are extremely harmful to the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases harm the earth's atmosphere and we as humans, need the atmosphere to protect us from harmful radiation. By limiting car use, you are technically saving the planet and everyone on it.

Second of all, cars cause smog. Smog is extremely harmful to breathe in and is also bad for the environment. For example, in Paris, France, the government enforced a driving ban to alleviate the thick smog. After a few days of less cars on the road, the smog cleared up! Source 2 This proves that if we didn't have cars in the cities that have smog such as Beijing and Paris, then smog would be much less of a problem and cities would be a much more healthy and safe place to live. Therefore, limiting cars results in less smog.

The last reason that limiting car usage is beneficial is that it will improve the environment and society. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Source 3 This shows that by reducing car usage, it has helped the city's economy and created a better place to live for its citizens. Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, envisioned a world where personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. He saw a world that would ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety,"" Source 4 This shows that by reducing car usage, the environment and society can be improved drastically.

All in all, I strongly believe that by reducing car usage, we can make the world a better place. By doing so, we can limit harmful green house gas, reduce smog, and change society for the better. These are only a few of the advantages of limiting car usage but you can already see why it is such a good idea. I hope you can take this information and make the world a better place.",0
"Dear State Senator, Im going to tell you why im in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I will give you a few reasons why we should keep the Electoral College and don't worry I will also tell you some stuff, that's not really good to keeping it.

Lets start off with the first reason why we should keep the Electoral College. The first reason is the big states. I probably have confused you but let me explain to you what I mean. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, in 2012 the popular vote was really close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote. In other words, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The second reason why is, avoiding runoff elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast which would highly complicate the presidential election, which is reduced by the Electoral College. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state for example, Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Next reason is swing states. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate, as we saw in 2012's election. The voter who are in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, really listening to the competing candidates. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Now im going to tell you something bad about keeping the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Let me ask you a few questions, who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding for public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? Well, sometimes state conventions, or state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Did you know the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

I'll admit that the Electoral College is a bit unfair and irrational...but there is also some really good reasons to keep it. No matter how hard it is to decide, I have stated my reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. To me I believe that Bob Dole was wrong when he said, ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" We should not abolish the Electoral College but instead, keep it and maybe make it better.",0
"Although you may think of your car as a necessity, there are many advantages to not being behind the wheel. Greenhouse gas emissions would decrease and promote alternative transportation are among those many.

As the majority of people learned in grade school, greenhouse gases aren't such a great thing and are even destroying the planet. Stepping away from your car could decrease the amount of these deadly gases we put into our atmosphere. in the first article Rosenthal says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe, and up to 50 in some carintensive areas in the United States."" If the output is really that high and we stop using cars as much imagine the impact it could have if this happened world wide. in the second article Duffer was talking about how Paris had to ban cars because the smog, an effect of greenhouse gases, was too thick. towards the end he said that a few days of the car ban reduced the amount enough to where they could lift the ban. the smog was said to rival China's, and you see that on the news constantly so if only a few days made it significantly better then why can't we try it out?

Promoting alternative transportation could help local economies rise, and lower stress levels. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" sais a business man participating in boat's carfree day. Participants in these events claim that they relieve stress and most people can see why, it's very hard to avoid stressful situations when you're driving. Whether it's the guy who cut you off or a slow old lady there is always something that will grind your gears. the executive chairman of the Ford company said that ""in cities where vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable they would be able to create a network that would save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" If there are other sources of transportation available, why not take advantage of them?

Lowering our usage of cars we could keep our planet in good condition by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases and promoting alternative forms of transportation which has benifits within itself. If there are other options the only problem I see is that you can't pick what radio station is on.",0
"In Miami, sitting in traffic is simply a part of everyday life, be it during lunch hour or rush hour or be it because of unpredictable accidents or planned road closures. The city is so large that it is oftentimes impossible to walk from point A to point B in a timely manner, and the climate is so unpredictable that is is oftentimes impossible to make such a trek anyways. Could Miami ever be made a carfree community? Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.

Carfree communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to carfree lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient Rosenthal, Selsky. Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogota's citywide carfree day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 Selsky. A mother of two and media trainer in Vaudan, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was ""always tense"" Rosenthal.

It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. ""Cars are responsible for... up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States Rosenthal. Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear Duffer. Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more ecoconscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency Duffer.

Carfree communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as effictient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though carfree communities must make allowances for the creation and maintainment of things like better sidewalks and bicicyle paths for citizens who elect to use them Rosenthal, Selsky. Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in citytypical, and definitely Miamitypical, traffic jams Duffer.

While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of carfree lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some of the benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, milennials in America have already started this move towards carfree communities Rosenthal. Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or carpool with friends. Sociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The ""car culture"" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues Rosenthal.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, and for good reason. While cars have been a symbol of suburban life and freedom of mobility, they also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, communities can reap numerous benefits. These include reducing emissions, improving air quality, increasing physical activity, and fostering stronger communities.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" it is mentioned that diesel fuel, which is commonly used in France, contributes to smog and air pollution. By reducing car usage, especially diesel vehicles, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants in the air, leading to cleaner and healthier communities.

Limiting car usage also promotes physical activity and better health. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, residents rely on walking and cycling as their primary modes of transportation. This not only reduces emissions but also encourages a more active lifestyle. Studies have shown that regular physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and enhance overall well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can foster stronger communities. In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" it is mentioned that car-free days in Bogota, Colombia have been successful in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog. These events bring people together, create a sense of community, and encourage social interaction. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors, explore their surroundings, and support local businesses.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and foster stronger communities. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, communities can create a more sustainable and livable environment for their residents. It is important for individuals, governments, and organizations to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing effective strategies to achieve these goals.",1
"Cars are great, you can get from one point to another in a short amount of time, but are they really necessary? After all we have public transportation, bicycles, and our own two feet.

The advantages of car usage can be picked up by other forms of transportation, and the environment can be saved at the same time. If car usage was limited the world and its people would be much better off. There would be less pollution, a drop in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes, less accidents, and over all a healthier planet and world population.

There would be less pollution because if car usage was limited then there would be less pollutants from the gas in cars going up into the air. Source 2 provides evidence of this, from ""...days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Duffer 10 to ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Additionally many people are content with not having a vehicle, or even a licence in some cases, as shown in Source 1, 3, and 4. In Source 1 Heidrun Walter explains her view on not having a car after previously owning one, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Carlos Arturo Plaza in Source 3, shows his support unlimited car usage by saying how it helps the environment and the health of the people in reducing stress, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" In Source 4 Elisabeth Rosenthal speaks of how her own children and Mr. Sivak's son, all avoid using cars and Rosenthal's children don't even have licenses and they are 19 and 21 years old.

The health of the people in our world would improve and there would be less people diagnosed with diabetes because they would likely get more exercise. With limited car usage people would have to find other ways of transportation, which includes bike riding, skating, hiking, or public transportation. While using public transportation would not help to improve the health of the people, biking, skating, and hiking would, as some people do these things just for exercise. So if people were forced to do one of these alternative forms of transportation, they would be exercising and getting from point A to point B all in one shot.

Not only would limited car usage help peoples health by making them be more active, but it would also help by providing cleaner air. Poluted air can cause health problems, especially in the lungs, if car usage was limited, then polution would go down, so people would be breathing fresher air that would cause less lung damage.

There would be less accidents because there would be less cars on the road. The majority of the vehicles on the road would likely be public transportation too, so the drivers may be more cautious than the average driver since they have the lives of many people in their hands.

The world would be a safer and healthier place is car usage was limited.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living. This movement is gaining traction in various parts of the world, as exemplified by the car-free communities in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. Limiting car usage offers several advantages, including environmental benefits, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can greatly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The car-free community of Vauban in Germany serves as a successful example of this, with 70 percent of families living without cars and experiencing a decrease in their carbon footprint.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage also leads to improved public health. The smog and pollution caused by cars have detrimental effects on air quality, which can contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues. The driving ban in Paris, implemented to combat high levels of pollution, resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can reduce these health risks and create cleaner and healthier communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can enhance the overall quality of life for individuals and communities. The car-free day in Bogota, for example, has been successful in creating a day free from traffic congestion and allowing people to engage in alternative activities such as hiking, biking, and skating. This not only reduces stress and improves mental well-being but also creates a sense of community and connection among residents. The car-free community of Vauban in Germany has also demonstrated the positive effects of creating pedestrian-friendly streets and placing stores within walking distance, resulting in a more vibrant and socially active neighborhood.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including environmental benefits, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life. The examples of car-free communities and driving bans in different parts of the world demonstrate the effectiveness of these measures in reducing emissions, improving air quality, and creating more livable and sustainable communities. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can pave the way towards a greener and healthier future.",1
"imagine a world where global warming could actually be depicted as a myth, a world where you could walk out side a breath cleaner and more safer air. Limiting car usages will indeed help the environment in a major way over a estimated period of time. elisabeth Rosenthal, author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Robert Duffer, author of Paris bans driving due to smog, Andrew Selsky, author of Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota and elisabethh Rosenthal, author of The End of Car Culture all have valid points when it come to explaining the great advantages of limiting car usages. Without the use of car america would indeed be a safer and move gren place to live.

To begain, cars is one major sorce of stress and pollution and without them he earth would be alittle more peaceful. The turnout was large, dispite gra clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota Selsky. The source above is just one example of how the lack out cars brought together a whole city. Walking around in the rain, something most people wouldnt do often was brought together when a city banned cars for a day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Unless you are driving a electric car, cars are not good for the environment in an way. Passenger cars ae responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe Rosenthal. May not seem like a big number but that 12 percent will effect the environment, causing things like global warming. Cars are needed in daily life but limiting their uses from now and then would help improve the life expectancy of our Earth.

Furthermore lowering the uses of car can also can help save the Earth we are talking about a long term outcome. Paris typicaly has more smog than other European capitals....last week Paris had 17 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter Duffer. France has high levels of smog due to their use of diesel more then gasoline. These high levels would be lowered once the use of cars are limited. The use of driving can be limited in multiple was, such as the use of internet or cell phones. Whie these devices can only give you the feeling of talking to one another, it is a very great way to reduce emmision levels. The internet makes telelcommuting possible and allows people to feel moe connected withou driving to meet friends Rosenthal.

In conclusion, a safer and more greener earth are just two advantages of limiting car usages. The Eath will also be around for your daughter and her kids to come. Their are mulitple ways andvantages of limiting car usages.",0
"When you're voting for a president to govern our country, your vote should count just as much as anyone else's. The political way of voting right now, is by using electoral college. You cast your vote thinking that your voting for a president when actually your voting for that candidates electors. Electoral college is unfair, irrational, and could have some really serious consequences.

Electoral college is not fair at all to the people voting. When you vote for president, most of the time you think that your voting for the person that you think will really help to improve this country. With electoral college, you might as well just vote directly for the electors. If all your vote is doing is going to the electors, then presidential candidates shouldn't even advertise themselves because in the end your not voting for them, your voting for the electoral college for that candidate.

The presidential candidates don't go to all the states when running. They simply go to the states that they know will support them and the states that will most likely vote against them. What about all the other states that arent neccesarly with or against the candidate? They don't ever see any advertisements for the candidates, the person in the presidential race doesnt go to see them, and so when they vote they are basically blindsited by the name on the ballet. It's completly irrational to only go to the states that love you or hate you.

The best argument against the electoral college is something called the disaster factor. To make a long story short, basically it's that the state legislatures pick the electors, and those electors could always defy the rights and will of the people. For example, you could vote for a presidential candidate, but hisher electors cast their vote for the opposing candidate. That's taking away your right to vote for the person that you want to win.

When voting, your vote should go to the person that you chose. Not who the electoral college for that person called. Electoral collages have so many flaws in the system. It's unfair to the people voting, not all the states get as much exposure to the candidate as others, and the system could totally collapse on itself if the electors dont vote for the person that you voted for. That is why popular voting is the best way to elect a political figure. Your vote is going to the person you choose, not to the person someone else chooses for you.",0
"United States of America, the land of the people right? When people think of America they think of freedom, so isn't it our job to keep it that way? With our electoral college, the people of America aren't truly given the right to where their vote matters. The electoral college has so many flaws such as the disaster factor, risk of a tie, and even how unfair it is to our countries voters.

The disaster factor is the risk that the electors could always defy the will of the people. The electors are picked by state legislatures, so it could easily happen where electors disobey the right citizens have and do what they choose, or the legislatures replace electors with maleficent unpatriotic electors that will try to cheat the vote. How is that fair to us? Knowing that thousands and thousands of voters dedicate their time to focusing on which candidate is truly the most deserving, proactive, and thoughtfull. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" The Office of the Federal Register. Here was a time where had already been done, and it is sure to happen again.

Overall the electoral college is completely unfair with so many different problems that over rule the right of other people. For example, ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning..."" The Office of the Federal Register , this shows how it is not really fair to all the states as even if the popular vote comes close, the winning candidate takes all the electoral votes.

It is possible as well for the electoral votes to tie for both candidates, in which case if this were to happen it would be a catastrophe, as the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 million voters"" The Office of the Federal Register. The population difference between the two is beyond comparable with California exceeding Wyoming with over 30 million voters. And to know that the two states would each get one vote? How is that, in any way possible, fair to American voters.

With so many problems with the electoral college and it being unimaginably unjust, the common thought would be how could this possibly still be the final word of our presidential election. If the Disaster factor, risk of a tie, and undoubting unfairness still haven't woken up our government, then how far and much destruction of our country's freedom will it take for the United States of America to truly be, the land of the people.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This trend is gaining popularity across the globe, as evidenced by the car-free communities in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and create more livable and vibrant communities.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some parts of the United States, that number can go as high as 50 percent. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This is particularly important in the fight against climate change and the pursuit of sustainable living.

Another benefit is the reduction of traffic congestion. Cars are the linchpin of suburban life, but their dominance on the roads leads to clogged highways and busy streets. By promoting car-free communities like Vauban in Germany, we can create more accessible and walkable neighborhoods. Placing stores along main streets instead of distant highways encourages people to walk or bike, reducing traffic congestion and improving overall mobility.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable and vibrant communities. The car-dominated suburbs that were popular in the 1950s may no longer be sustainable in the face of increasing car ownership and urbanization. By prioritizing public transportation, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, we can create communities that are more connected and cohesive. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also attracts visitors and boosts local economies.

Moreover, the trend of limiting car usage can also have positive implications for public health. By encouraging active transportation like walking and biking, we can promote physical activity and reduce the sedentary lifestyle that often comes with car-centric living. This can help combat issues such as obesity and improve overall public health outcomes.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, creating livable communities, and promoting public health, we can move towards a more sustainable and resilient future. The examples of car-free communities, driving bans, and car-free days demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace this trend and work towards a future with a reduced reliance on cars.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. As outlined in the passage set, there are various benefits to adopting a lifestyle that relies less on cars and more on alternative modes of transportation. These advantages include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and the creation of more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the roads, we can make a substantial impact on lowering these emissions, which contribute to climate change. This is particularly important given the current global environmental crisis we are facing.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage set highlights the smog problems experienced in cities such as Paris. By reducing the number of cars on the roads, we can decrease the pollution caused by vehicle emissions, resulting in cleaner and healthier air for everyone. This is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals who suffer from respiratory issues or allergies.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on our physical and mental well-being. The passage set discusses how residents of car-free communities reported feeling less tense and happier without the constant stress of car ownership. Walking, biking, or using public transportation as alternative modes of transportation can provide opportunities for physical exercise and reduce sedentary lifestyles. This can lead to improved physical fitness and overall health.

Moreover, limiting car usage can contribute to the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, cities and suburbs can be designed in a way that is more accessible to public transportation, walking, and biking. Stores and services can be located closer to residential areas, making them easily accessible without the need for a car. This type of smart planning, as mentioned in the passage set, can create vibrant and connected communities where people can live, work, and play in close proximity.

Overall, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting alternative modes of transportation and promoting smart planning, we can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future. It is essential for individuals and communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and take steps towards embracing a car-free lifestyle.",1
"Dear Mr. Senator, I am writing you concerning a topic that is very important to our country, and the citizens that preside in it. The electoral college is the current method of determining who will be elected as the president of the United states of America. As you know, it does so by allowing our citizens to vote for electors that then choose who they want as president for us. Citizens will most often vote for an elector that has sworn to vote for either the democratic or republican party's candidates for president. However, I don't quite agree with this method of election. Through my research on this subject, I have discovered that not only do these citizens not have the access to vote directly for who they want to run their country, but also that many electors go back on their word and vote for another party's candidate. I believe the system should be changed and the president should be elected through popular vote, and I'm not alone, according to a gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of the population agrees with me.

If the popular vote elects the president, every citizen will have their own choice on who they want as a president. In an electoral college, many people will merely have their votes casted aside becausetheir decisions or thoughts aren't the same as eveyone else in their state. Though some people say an electoral college is positive because it requires the candidate have more than just regional appeal, but if people in that state like a specific candidate, even if they vote for an elector, the rest of their state may not like that candidate, and that person's vote will be cast away.

Also, the electoral college doesn't always follow the peoples' vote. For example, if there were to be a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Since many people vote for a different party candidate than who they vote for, for the House of Representatives, they would not get their vote for president counted for anything, and the House may choose the president they don't want, without getting a say in any of it. Not to mention the 2000 election when Al Gore got more votes overall, but Bush won the presidency due to the unfair, outdated system of the electoral college. The electoral college puts the decision of who will be the president into a couple hundred peoples' hands, instead of every American citizen.

Another reason for changing the method to popular vote is the fact that all of the electors count the same. Since each state only counts for one electoral vote, the one elector from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, will count for the same as the 55 electors from, California, who represent 35 million voters. That simply isn't fair because it's the same as saying the opinions of only 500,000 voters in Wyoming are as influencial and important as the entire 35 million voters' opinions from California. The fact that not all American citizens, promised to be able to vote for who will lead their country and influence their everyday life, are able to do so is absurd.

Many people argue and say that just one vote won't make a difference, but there are 34,500,000 people in California alone that are being disregarded and not counted for anything more than the 500,000 in Wyoming.

Why should the people living in smaller states have more influence than those with larger populations? Why shouldn't those 34.5 million people in California be able to make their own decision and choose their own vote for the President? The entire population of every single state in the United States of America, that has the legal right to do so, should be able to vote, and to have their vote actually counted for something instead of just having their decision made for them by someone they've never even met. With the popular vote deciding who will be president, everyone will matter just the same, which is how it should be since we are all created equal, and we all should have the equal power to decide how our country will be governed and who will govern it, we should all be counted not just the small percentage that is at the top. Thank you for your time and consideration.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. Implementing measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce reliance on cars can have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and public health. Several examples from around the world illustrate the benefits of limiting car usage.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, walking, or cycling, we can decrease our emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities, especially in suburban areas, heavy car usage leads to excessive traffic, which not only wastes time but also contributes to pollution and accidents. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburb, only two places to park are available, resulting in 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This low-car suburban life model promotes public transportation and reduces the need for parking spaces, ultimately leading to less congestion on the roads.

Limiting car usage also has positive health effects. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, with diesel fuel being a major culprit (Duffer, 2014). By decreasing car usage, we can improve air quality and, consequently, public health. Furthermore, promoting alternative modes of transportation like walking or cycling can also encourage physical activity, leading to improved overall well-being and a reduction in obesity rates.

Moreover, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and compact development. Traditional suburban developments, with spread-out homes and private garages, have long been the norm. However, new approaches like the Vauban model advocate for more walkable communities with stores located nearby rather than in distant malls (Rosenthal, 2009). This smart planning not only reduces the need for long car trips but also creates vibrant and accessible neighborhoods.

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has become a great success, with millions of Colombians using alternative transportation methods (Selsky, 2002). This event showcases the potential for change and demonstrates that cities can function without the heavy dependence on cars. Furthermore, initiatives like bike-sharing programs and car-sharing services contribute to the overall goal of limiting car usage and promoting sustainable transportation options (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving public health, and promoting sustainable development, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly communities. Examples from around the world demonstrate that alternative modes of transportation can be successful, and it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace these changes for a sustainable future.",1

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in choosing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for both the Electoral College and election by popular vote, the Electoral College provides several key benefits that we must consider before making any changes. The arguments below demonstrate why the Electoral College system should be maintained.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote even though he only secured 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This discrepancy showcases how the Electoral College system can prevent a prolonged dispute over the election outcome. Additionally, due to the winner-take-all method, a very slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This adds stability to the system and prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters the notion that the President serves as the leader of the entire nation, rather than being solely the representative of the majority. The requirement for trans-regional appeal ensures that each presidential candidate must cater to the needs and concerns of voters in different regions. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from winning, the Electoral College encourages candidates to consider the interests of citizens from various parts of the country, making them more likely to be successful presidents who serve the nation as a whole.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, thereby engaging with a wider range of voters across the country. This system ensures that the most thoughtful voters, typically found in toss-up states, have a significant say in deciding the election outcome. By doing so, the Electoral College promotes an election process where candidates invest time and resources in campaigning across different regions, allowing for a more inclusive representation of voter interests.

Fourthly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of both large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate often disadvantages large states in terms of political weight. The Electoral College helps to address this issue by giving more attention to large states during the campaign. For example, a close popular vote in Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas a similar victory margin in Wyoming would only yield 3. This balance ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are considered in the presidential election process.

Fifthly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This system ensured clear winners in cases like Nixon's victory in 1968 and Clinton's victory in 1992, where they secured a majority of electoral votes despite a plurality in the popular vote. By providing a decisive outcome, the Electoral College system avoids the complications and costs associated with run-off elections.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may discourage potential voters if their state leans heavily toward one party, it should be noted that a significant proportion of eligible voters still participate in elections, regardless of the likelihood of their vote affecting the national outcome. Voters express their preferences and contribute to the democratic process, even if their vote is unlikely to sway the final result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses candidates' attention on swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages demonstrate why we should maintain the Electoral College to ensure a fair and effective process for choosing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering this perspective. I hope you will take these points into account when discussing any potential changes to our current election system. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or would like to discuss this matter in more detail.

Sincerely,

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College or Changing to Popular Vote

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. While the popular vote seems to be a straightforward and democratic way to determine the victor, there are several key reasons why the Electoral College should be maintained.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In recent history, we have witnessed close elections where the popular vote winner did not secure the presidency. However, the Electoral College has always produced a clear winner. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote is almost always greater than their share of the popular vote. This system reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome of the election, providing a more stable and reliable process.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president."" No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to determine the outcome of the election. This means that a presidential candidate must strive for trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of all regions. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be an effective president. By requiring candidates to garner support across different regions, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation, rather than just a particular region or interest group.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states. This system grants winner-take-all electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state. As a result, candidates prioritize campaigning in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This intensifies the competition and forces candidates to address the concerns and interests of the voters in these states. Additionally, swing state voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making them the most thoughtful and informed electorate. This focus on swing states ensures that the election is decided by the most engaged and informed voters.

Fourthly, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states. The apportionment of the Electoral College provides smaller states with more weight in the political process than their population alone would grant them. This prevents larger states from monopolizing the presidential election and ensures that candidates must pay attention to the concerns and interests of citizens in smaller states. This balance of power strengthens the representation of all citizens, regardless of their state's size or population.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. This system guarantees that a candidate who secures a majority of electoral votes becomes the president. This eliminates the complexity and uncertainty associated with run-off elections, where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. The certainty provided by the Electoral College ensures a smooth transition of power and avoids prolonged political disputes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides several crucial advantages that the popular vote lacks. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes a president who represents the entire nation, encourages candidates to address swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. While it may not be a perfect system, it has proven to be effective and essential in preserving the integrity of our democratic process.

Thank you for considering these points as you contemplate the future of the Electoral College. I trust that you will make a decision that upholds the values of fairness, representation, and stability in our great nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definitely is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.

The electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.

Al Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election popular vote. The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.

There are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren't able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party's candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.

The electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president.",0
"Do you want to live in a place where the air is polluted? Somewhere it is hard to breath. The earth would be a cleaner and more efficient place to live if we limit the everyday usage of cars. Just think about it by limiting the usage of cars you are saving money and making the earth a cleaner place. It's like the old saying goes ""kill two birds with one stone.

Who doesn like having some extra money in there pockets to spend? I know I definetely do. By limiting the usage of cars people will no longer have to pay a car payment. Or even better have to pay these outrageous gas prices. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have at law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" If we limit the usage of cars there wont be any reason to build new highways and the money can go to more important things.

Wouldnt you like to wake up in the morning, walk out side and get a wiff of fresh clean air? Limiting car usage will also cut the amount of green house gas emissions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emotions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states."" Cars are major contribution to the pollution we have in the air today. Having cleaner air makes the earth an all around better place. The people will be happier and the grass will be greener. ""Last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london."" I dont know of any person on this earth that wants to breath in particulate matter on a daily basis. ""Its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said business man Carlos Arturo. This man is in his right mind. Polution is a major stressor for everyone. Thats why I say by limiting car usage it will make people happier. People act like riding a bike is a bad thing. Its always good to get some exercise and be healthy.

If we aren't using cars thers no reason to have highways. And if we dont have highways then city will be smaller.""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in mall along some distant highway."" Where i grew up everything was close. There were resturants less than a mile away. The mall was a 5minute bike ride. And school was only 10 minutes away. Everythig was convienent. I didnt have to get in the car and hope that it started it up. There was no waiting in traffic. All I had to do was hop on my bike and ride off.

If we stay at the rate we are going now the earth is going to turn in to a place that no one wants to live. So if we limit the usage of cars the earth will be a overall better place to live. If we dont drive there is less polution. If we dont have cars we dont need highways and the our city will be more compact. And no cars means more money in our pockets. If that doesn sound like a perfect place to live then I dont want to know what your idea of perfect is.",0
"Dear Senator, There have been multiple arguments on wether or not the Electoral College should be used for electing the President. Electing a President by the Electoral College is a better idea than electing a president through popular vote. Representatives know what is right for their country while most of American citizens would not make the right decisions, and sometimes do not even make any decisions at all.

First off, citizens themselves elect their own state representatives for the House of Representatives. They vote for them for many reasons. The representatives are well educated. The people vote for the representatives, and in return, they expect and trust the representatives to make the right decisions for them.Electing a new president is a pretty big deal and should be taken care of in the hands of the trusted representatives. According to Richard A. poster's article Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the P resident, that trust is rarely betrayed.

As stated in reason 3 of this article, "" ...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""The Representatives are the most thoughtful voters. This is what the representatives do. It is their job. They dedicate most of their life to representing the people who elected them and making decisions on their behalf. They should be the ones doing the decision making.

Now if this were not to be this case and popular vote was the priority source of votes in electing a President, then the voting results would be completely biased. There would be a chance that majority of the votes put into the ballot were decided without true thought. People could easily vote on something important just by randomly electing just like closing your eyes and choosing a marble out of a marble jar. They could also vote for the candidate who their best friend voted for and not even think about their own opinion or why they even decided to choose that person in the first place. Another thing that affects the voting charts is the lack of participation. 15% of Americans do not vote. Every American citizen has the right to vote. It is their civil duty to vote during an election, and yet, 15% of them still choose not to.

What is better: A country run by people making uneducated decisions on major things or having the thoughtful people be the ones who decide on the course of this country? Unless America increases the quality of education and spreads the word on the amount of importance that it is to vote, important tasks such as electing a President should be kept in the hands of the educated Representatives of the Electoral College. Thank you for your time.",0
"Goodmorning fellow citizens , i hope you all are having a wonderful day! Could that possibly be because you all walked or rode your bike to this meeting today? The reason behind that is because there are many advantages tolimiting car usage. You are less tense and happier , , smog free air , and you can have fun with it! Bringing together your community. Now , who's up for a challenge.

CarFree Cities as in Source 1:""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" , by Elisabeth Rosenthal , made really good points.First i would say , not having your car makes you stress free. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars , and 50% sold a car to move here. ""When i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way"" , said Heidrun Walter , a media trainer and mother of two , as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. People are giving up their cars because they claim it's more to life. In the United States , the environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities , and legislators are starting to act.

Source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" , by Robert Duffer , talks about ""healthier"" air. So , another advantage would be to have smogfree air. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions , diesel fuel was to blame. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue and Public transit was free of charge from Friday Monday , according to BBC. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday. This way the air we breath doesn't harm us.

Source 3: ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" , by Andrew Selsky is exciting.Lastly i would like to state , you can have fun with not having a car bringing together your community. In a program millions of Columbians hiked , biked , skated , or took buses to work during a carfree day. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution , "" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed and new improvements have been made everywhere. Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" , by Elisabeth Rosenthal explains thegreenhouse effect also , and the change it's had on the economy.

In my closing remarks i would like to say overall the advantages of limiting car usage is amazing! We can have fun with it and improve global warming and our economy. Who wants to help me tell the mayor this situation? I'm about to give in my car right now! You are less tense , smogfree air , and your community can join in. Now i ask again......",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and have a wide range of benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. One of the main advantages is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute towards a healthier environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. The passages mention instances where cities like Paris and Bogota implemented car-free days to reduce smog and pollution. The results were significant, with congestion decreasing by 60 percent in Paris and the streets of Bogota becoming eerily devoid of traffic jams. By reducing car usage, we can improve the quality of the air we breathe and create a more pleasant and healthy living environment.

Limiting car usage also encourages alternative means of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation. This not only promotes a more active lifestyle but also reduces traffic congestion and the need for large parking spaces. In the German suburb of Vauban, for example, where cars are generally forbidden, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This shows that it is possible to live without cars and still have a convenient and fulfilling life.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passages mention how delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the car ban in Paris. However, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that there are opportunities for businesses to adapt to a car-reduced society and find new ways to thrive without relying solely on car transportation.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the revitalization of city centers. As the passages mention, the renewal of city centers in various cities has made the suburbs less appealing and drawn empty nesters back in. This can help to create vibrant and bustling city centers, with more opportunities for socializing, entertainment, and business.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and far-reaching. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting alternative means of transportation and revitalizing city centers, limiting car usage offers a multitude of benefits for individuals and society. By adopting smart planning and implementing car-reduced initiatives, we can create a more sustainable and enjoyable future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This approach is being implemented in various parts of the world, such as in the Vauban community in Germany, where car ownership is discouraged and alternative transportation methods are promoted (Rosenthal, 2009). By reducing the reliance on cars, we can achieve several benefits, including improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased physical activity.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change (Rosenthal, 2009). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can greatly decrease these emissions. For example, in Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal, 2009). This shows the significant contribution that cars make to climate change and the urgent need to limit their usage.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality in urban areas. Pollutants released from car exhaust, such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, contribute to smog and have harmful effects on human health (Duffer, 2014). A study conducted in Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog, found that congestion decreased by 60 percent and air quality improved (Duffer, 2014). Similar measures, such as car-free days, have been implemented in cities like Bogota, Colombia, resulting in reduced traffic and decreased air pollution (Selsky, 2002). By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes physical activity and encourages the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. In communities like Vauban, where car ownership is discouraged and public transportation and cycling infrastructure are prioritized, residents are more physically active and have higher levels of satisfaction (Rosenthal, 2009). Walking and cycling not only promote individual health but also reduce traffic congestion and promote community interaction. By creating pedestrian and cycle-friendly environments, we can enhance the livability and sustainability of our cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages in terms of environmental sustainability, improved air quality, and increased physical activity. By reducing the reliance on cars and promoting alternative transportation methods, we can address issues such as climate change, air pollution, and sedentary lifestyles. The experiences of communities like Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage. It is essential for individuals and society as a whole to recognize the benefits of reducing car dependency and work towards creating more sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The articles “In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars” by Elisabeth Rosenthal, “Paris bans driving due to smog” by Robert Duffer, “Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota” by Andrew Selsky, and “The End of Car Culture” by Elisabeth Rosenthal provide insights into the benefits of reducing car dependency and promoting alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the article by Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. The smog in cities like Paris, as described in Duffer’s article, is primarily caused by car emissions. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can significantly improve air quality and combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for individuals. The article on the German suburb of Vauban highlights how residents who have given up their cars feel a sense of relief and happiness. They no longer experience the stress associated with car ownership and the constant need to navigate through traffic. Instead, they enjoy walking on verdant streets and hearing the swish of bicycles. This is echoed in Selsky’s article on Bogota, where residents experience a car-free day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This allows people to move around the city easily and enjoy a stress-free commute.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. Rosenthal’s article on the end of car culture in the United States discusses how people are buying fewer cars and driving less, indicating a shift in behavior and preferences. This shift paves the way for smart planning and the development of communities that are less dependent on cars. As Selsky’s article on Bogota shows, car-free days have resulted in the construction of bicycle paths and the transformation of sidewalks, making the city more pedestrian-friendly. This creates a more inclusive and sustainable community where people can easily access amenities and reduce their reliance on private vehicles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. Duffer’s article on the Paris driving ban highlights how congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent during the smog crisis. This not only improves air quality but also increases the efficiency of transportation in the city. Less time spent in traffic means more productivity and reduced economic losses. The implementation of car-reduced communities, as mentioned in Rosenthal’s article, can also lead to financial savings for individuals who no longer need to own a car, as they have access to alternative means of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improved quality of life for individuals, the development of compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, cities can create a more sustainable and inclusive environment for their citizens. It is crucial for individuals and communities to embrace this shift in behavior and work towards a future with reduced car dependency.",1

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has its advantages and should be retained.

One of the strengths of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the presidential election. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the election results are more decisive and less likely to be disputed compared to a popular vote system. In instances where there is a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, the election is thrown to the House of Representatives, ensuring that a clear winner is determined.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is representative of all regions of the country. As Judge Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages presidential candidates to campaign in different states, rather than focusing solely on populous areas. This way, candidates must appeal to a diverse range of voters and address the concerns of various regions. This keeps the president accountable to the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few heavily populated areas.

The system of swing states, which is inherent in the Electoral College, also has its advantages. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner argues that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on closely contested states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more informed and engaged in the election process. These swing states often represent a diverse cross-section of the population, ensuring that the president is responsive to a wide range of viewpoints and concerns.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. Judge Posner explains that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states less political weight. By awarding electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College gives larger states more attention in presidential campaigns. This ensures that the interests and concerns of both large and small states are taken into account during elections.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, as explained by Judge Posner. This prevents complications and delays in the election process. It also ensures that a clear winner is determined, even if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps maintain confidence in the election results and prevents prolonged political uncertainty.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College system, such as the argument that it may discourage some voters in ""sure-win"" states from participating, the benefits of the system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides stability, representation, and accountability in the election process.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College when considering any potential changes to the presidential election system. It is clear that this system has its merits and has served our country well for centuries. I believe that preserving the Electoral College will uphold the principles on which our democracy was founded.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I look forward to your continued dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our nation.

"Dear State Senator, It has come to my attention the many problems that the Electoral College has. I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case.

First off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in it's Congressional delegation is just illogical...lets say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference. So really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will choose the president. An argument can be made against this...that the electors that you give your vote to will be trustworthy and vote for the person that your party wants. How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. This is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system is flawed...there are millions of people in America and yet only 538 votes are counted. There is no way to be assured that the person you voted for, or anyone else, was selected. We need to ask ourselves what the best thing is for our country... letting everybody be dissapointed in who was voted for, or seeing that they got what they spent time on going and voting on. This isn't just a captain for a football team, or a manager at work. This is the president of the United States, and he or she will be running our country for 4 years or even longer, so we need to question this method of voting. We are a unified country, and our unity shows what we want as a country..we shouldn't have one thing chosen and get something completely different in return. The election by popular voting would be a better overall choice for our country.

All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. The citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing car dependency, communities can experience improved air quality, decreased traffic congestion, and increased accessibility to public transportation. This can contribute to a healthier environment and enhanced quality of life for residents.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, with Europe attributing 12% and some car-intensive areas in the United States attributing up to 50% of their emissions to cars (Rosenthal). By promoting alternatives to car travel, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can help combat climate change and improve air quality.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. Cities that have implemented car-free zones or restricted driving have witnessed a decrease in congestion levels. For example, Paris enforced a partial driving ban during days of intense pollution, resulting in a 60% decrease in congestion (Duffer). This not only eases traffic flow but also reduces stress among commuters and improves overall efficiency.

Moreover, limiting car usage can enhance the accessibility and efficiency of public transportation. When communities are designed to be more compact and have fewer parking spaces, people are more encouraged to use public transportation. This can lead to increased investment in public transport systems, making them more convenient and reliable for commuters. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of residents participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic and promoting alternative modes of transportation (Selsky). This initiative has inspired other cities to follow suit and invest in improving public transportation options.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for a cultural shift towards sustainable and less car-dependent lifestyles. Studies have shown that Americans are driving less and buying fewer cars, suggesting a change in behavior and preferences (Rosenthal). The rise of telecommuting, car-sharing programs, and bike-sharing initiatives has further facilitated this shift. As more individuals choose to walk, bike, or use public transportation, their reliance on cars reduces, leading to healthier and more active lifestyles.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and congestion to improving air quality and promoting healthier lifestyles, communities can benefit greatly from making efforts to reduce car dependency. By embracing alternatives to car travel and investing in sustainable modes of transportation, individuals and society as a whole can create a more environmentally friendly and efficient future.",1
"The founding father's wanted a good amount of power to the people so the president wont have full control over the country. With the electorsal collage in act it will give less power to the people, gives more power to the electorss, and the disaster factor.

The electorsal collage gives less power to the people. This is true because the people have to vote for a electors instead of the president himself. People may get confuse on who is voting for who. Ultimately the only types of votes that actually matter end up being the electorss votes. Sometimes ""faithless"" electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. This makes the peoples votes almost worthless.

Electoral collage gives more power to the electorss. The founding father wanted to give power to all the people not small groups of them. state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people. This means the electorss have the vote not the people. When the actual people vote they basically fliped a coin hopeing that some person they don't know voted for the right guy. The electorss vote is what matters not the peoples.

The single best argument against the electorsal collage is what we might call the disaster factor. The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. State legislatures pick the electorss, and these electorss can disregard the people's votes and pick who ever they want. Back in 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

The electorsal collage system is a bad idea because it gives less power to the people, gives more to the electorss, and it is a disaster factor.",0
"Many people use cars to get from one place to another,but however, many states around the world are having people not using cars. In other words, many states are car free states and this has changed many cultural changes in the society that the people live in. Not using any cars provides many beneficial factors to not only the environment but to the people too and here's why. Having carfree states reduces car emission and canprovidehealthier productive lives of exercise.This changeto the world can inspire lots of people and open up the doors of nature's beauty to provide a peaceful way of living to the environment of the world.

We use cars everyday in our lives from going to restraints, jobs, homes, schools,ect. However, do we ever think that whenever we drive we are causing more pollution to spread from every mile we go? Cars are the number one leading pollution emission environment destroyers in the world. This pollution causes many close suburban areas with homes around to breathe in gas emission from cars. This is absolutely not healthy at all to many people. For example, in the article written by Robert Duffer in his title, ""Paris bans driving due to smog."" States that, ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter PM per cubic meter..."" That is more toxin to inhale that could possibly kill you! There are countries, for instance, like Germany that have some cities ""carfree"" as an experimental way to stop pollution emission and traffic jams causing loud noises to some closespaced suburban areas. Now, instead of using cars the people living in Germany are walking, riding bikes, or using trams to get from one place to another. So far, the people do not mind having any cars around and they even say they are happy and like the new change on where they live. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" says Heidrun Walter from the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, ""Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" So whenever you first sit in a car think about what you are about to do and think about how you can benefit yourself and the world by not spreading pollution emission from cars.

Many people want to exercise, stay fit, and lose weight depending on what they want to do. Some people like to jog or run to go to there jobs as a productive way to not use there cars but to get out and exercise more. Many people around the world perfer not to use cars but instead use anyother means of transportation to either make themselves healthy or to not use any means of spreading pollution. In fact many people that live in big cities such as New York and San Francisco with more cars driving in the population. Have young people from 1639 year olds that don't have a drivers license use other means of transportation to benefit themselves. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, ""The End of Car Culture."" States that, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" People ages from 1639 year olds are not caring about using cars or getting a drivers license but using any other means of transportation even if it is longer way to get to a destination. This is very beneficial for young people of 1639 year olds to have healthy lives at a young age so they can live longer and they can feel good about themselves.

Can you see now why having no cars as the means of transportation is a good thing? Many people are having healthier lives and live on not using pollution but using other means of transportation. People in many states and countries are happy with this change for the better as new meaning of change in cultural experiences.",0
"In today's society, most people believe that having a car is essential to everyday tasks. In their definition, everyday task can range from going food shopping to going to work in the morning. Some, on the other hand, consider everyday tasks to be checking in on friends just to showcase their new car. Although that may or may not be the mindset of many, people fail to realize there are other ways of reaching from point A to point B, without harming the environment and it's people. Limiting car usage not only benefits the person who is using the car, but their community and environment.

The use of a car isn't, at all, important in everyday use. Instead of using a car, which helps build up the problem of air pollution, one can simply walk, take a bike or even use public transportation. Just like Bogota, several countries should participate in a ""Carfree day"". Spreading awareness, that a car isn't always needed to move around an area, can help to benefit the people and the environment. As said in source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"", bringing awareness of more easy and effective public transportation,which can help to rid that particular country of the usage of cars. Once participants of this carfree day understand the effects they are having upon the air pollution, they would be much more willing to help with this process just like businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza, ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Overall the usage of cars doesn't benefit the environment. Sooner, rather than later, it is important that we realize this problem and fix it before it's too late for our community.

Not only is the usage of a car terrible for our environment, it is also not needed as how it was. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005"", during this time, many vehicles were purchased with a high demand and were considered to be popular, although that isn't the case anymore. As years went past, the number of miles began to drop steadily. ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars"", that may be the case for some, but for others they didnt feel it was necessary to own one. In German Suburbs, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"", providing this area with no need for a car. Since everything was so near, a car was a waste of thought. If they did own cars, they would have to pay for both the car and a means of where to park the car. Those expensies were usually ""40,000, along with a home"", much more money than a free walk to any of your local stores. With the hopes of limiting the usage of cars, comes the need for expanding Vaubanlike suburbs. With that being said, according to the article, these suburbs need to be expanded ""not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are chocking cities"".

To sum it up, the limiting of cars is becoming important in the development of the new world and the fixation of the old. As of now, cars consist of having no benefit for the environment and of certain communities. As days go on and more people become aware of the means of public transportation, hopefully there won't need to be any cars. To take action in this plan, more Vaubanlike suburbs need to be put in place to give off the same react. Although some people understand the full effect of a car on the environment, it is critial that nearly every person understands. Cars, as of today's age, aren't benefiting the public as how they used to.",0
"  Revolutionizing Urban Living  In an age defined by the ever-growing challenges of urbanization and environmental degradation, the concept of car-free cities is emerging as a transformative approach to reimagining urban life. Car-free cities prioritize the use of sustainable transportation options and restrict or eliminate private automobiles in urban spaces, fostering cleaner, healthier, and more vibrant environments. This essay delves into the concept of car-free cities, exploring their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities embody a vision of urban living that champions sustainability, health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a vital role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This responsible approach is integral to combating climate change.  Public Health: Car-free cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to enhanced respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents.  Optimal Use of Space: These cities efficiently repurpose urban space by converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape and enhances the overall quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be a significant financial burden. In car-free cities, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, which contributes to their overall financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The shift to car-free living can face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities relies on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a vital aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands thorough planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  To successfully realize car-free cities, strategies include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and prioritizing public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a compelling vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthy goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities represent an inspiring glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Senator of the State of Florida, The Electoral College has been a part of our country since is was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. Although it has been used for so long and some what effectively, I believe that the act of changing the process to election by popular vote would benefit the country and the residents more. Many poeple do think that the Electoral College is more fair and is better because of its certain outcome and other good aspects. My belief about the electoral College differs. I believe it is unfair and outdated, and I am not alone on that opinion.

An argument against the Electoral college is the disaster factor, information from the passage The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. In 2000, the biggest election crisis took place in a century. In 1960, segregationists almost had success in replacing electors with people who would benefit them. Along with that, some electors may not be truthful and defy those who they are electing for and elect the opposer. All these examples come with fault in the system.

Another example from the same article claims that the idea of a tie is the most unsettling. The election would be put into the hands of the House of Representatives. An argument for the Electoral College claims the chance of a tie is very unlikely, but it has come close before. In 1968 and in 1976, a small shift would've cost the election. On the other hand, it would be much more difficult to tie a popular vote, seeing that there are far more citizens than electors for the college.

There are claims that the Electoral College is both fair and unfair for different reasons. People claim that it is fair because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, when a popular vote might, from the article In Defense of the the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. However, the process is unfair as well. In result of a winnertakeall system in the states, the presidental candidates don't spend time in states they know they don't have a chance in. This is unfair to voters because not all states get to see the candidates at all. Swing states have all the focus on them. These states are more likely to pay attention to campaigns. This is not fair because those running for the position will focus more on those states. With a popular vote, the candidates will want to contact each state to make sure those who reside there have paid attention to them and will hopefully vote for those people.

The process of the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and risky. There are so many opportuntities for disaster and a lot of unfairness all around. With people relying on the fact that the chances are slim or disaster is unlikely to happen is just not smart and there are things we can do about it. With a popular vote, a fair count is given and the president who more people choose will take office. Our country is a whole, and we treat the process of election like it isn't. Let the population decide and it's a fair trial let a few electors decide and it could lead to disaster. Thank you.",0

Subject: The Need to Keep the Electoral College in the Selection of the President

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College serves important purposes and should be preserved. In this letter, I will provide several compelling reasons for maintaining the Electoral College and address counterarguments that have been presented.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. With a winner-take-all system in most states, the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes. This ensures that the winning candidate has a clear majority in the Electoral College, which promotes stability and eliminates the need for run-off elections. In contrast, a direct popular vote system may lead to disputes over the outcome and the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency while lacking a majority of votes nationwide. The electoral vote system avoids such scenarios.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country is represented in the election of the president. Candidates must have trans-regional appeal and campaign in various states, rather than focusing solely on densely populated areas or specific regions. This prevents candidates from neglecting the concerns and interests of citizens in less populous states. In a direct popular vote system, candidates may focus their efforts on only a few populous states, leaving citizens in other states feeling disenfranchised. The Electoral College ensures that every citizen's vote is important and that the president represents the interests of the entire nation.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and learn about the particular concerns and priorities of those voters. In a direct popular vote system, candidates may focus their efforts solely on large, populous states or urban centers with the most voters. This could result in candidates paying less attention to the issues facing citizens in smaller, rural states. The Electoral College requires candidates to engage with voters across the country, providing a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole.

Furthermore, the Electoral College serves as a means of restoring political balance between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states equal representation in the upper house. By awarding electoral votes based on state representation in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive greater attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This system acknowledges the importance of both large and small states in national elections and avoids marginalizing the voices of citizens in smaller states.

Lastly, critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who reside in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning. However, voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, with approximately half of the eligible population participating. Voters are motivated not only by the potential impact of their individual vote but also by the desire to express their political preferences. Additionally, the possibility of swing states and close elections ensures that candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters, regardless of the outcome in any particular state.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of the democratic process for the election of the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, provides representation for every region of the country, encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, balances political power between large and small states, and maintains high voter turnout. While some argue for a direct popular vote system, the Electoral College has proven effective and should be retained. I urge you to consider these points and support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this important matter. I appreciate your dedication to the well-being and representation of our great state.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The dispute over keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for awhile. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" Source 1. However not everyone thinks this is fair. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Source 2 So as a result, it is not the people voting for their president, but it is the slate electors. Voting should be based off of popular vote because the electors might not always be picked fairly, the ""winnertakeall system,"" and what happens when there is a tie.

""Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" Source 2 This can be a problem because voters can not control who their electors vote for, because now the decision is in their hands. Also, voters sometimes will get confused about the electors and then will vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college is also unfair because of the winnertakeall system. According to source 2, ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races."" Another common concern in the electoral voting process is ""What happens when there is a tie?"" If there is a tie, the election then goes to The House of Representatives where they then have the state delegations vote on the president. This is your country, so don't you want to have a say on who runs it? ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect then will of the people."" Source 2 In Conclusion, we should change voting to popular vote. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Source 2 The Electoral College is not always fair, and at times can be uncertain. As the people we should be able to vote for our president, and not have to leave it up to The House of representatives to make the right choice for us.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, as part of a movement called ""smart planning."" This movement is gaining traction in both developed and developing countries, and the benefits are becoming increasingly evident.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions, helping to combat climate change and improve air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activities such as walking or cycling. This not only improves individual health but also reduces traffic congestion and the need for expensive infrastructure like highways and parking lots. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed without the stress of car ownership.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. In many car-free communities, public transportation is more accessible, and stores and services are located within walking or cycling distance. This reduces the reliance on cars for daily activities and encourages the use of more sustainable transportation options. In Bogota, Colombia, car-free days have been implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These events have been successful in encouraging millions of people to use buses, bicycles, or simply walk to work, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there is less need for road maintenance and the construction of new highways and parking lots. This frees up resources that can be used for other important purposes, such as public transportation improvements and the development of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Additionally, car-free communities often attract new businesses and residents, contributing to the local economy.

While the idea of limiting car usage may seem daunting, the shift is already happening. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior, if it continues, can have significant positive implications for carbon emissions, the environment, and the overall well-being of individuals and communities. Governments and policymakers are increasingly recognizing this trend and taking steps to promote car-reduced communities and prioritize public transportation in their planning.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of a healthier lifestyle, and economic benefits. As more communities adopt smart planning principles and prioritize alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations. It is time to rethink our reliance on cars and embrace a more balanced and sustainable approach to transportation.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Surname],

I am writing to express my views on an important issue that impacts our nation's presidential elections: the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. Although some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and undemocratic, I maintain that it plays a crucial role in our political system for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in elections. As we have witnessed in the past, disputes over the popular vote are not uncommon. However, due to the winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This structure reduces the likelihood of disputes and provides a clear and decisive result, making it more likely that the will of the people is accurately represented.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" Under this system, candidates must have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely focus on winning states with a majority of electoral votes. This ensures that presidential candidates must campaign across different regions, listening to diverse perspectives and addressing the concerns of citizens nationwide. By encouraging candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, the Electoral College fosters a sense of inclusivity and representation for all Americans.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its emphasis on swing states. Consequently, candidates focus their campaign efforts on these states, which can lead to more informed and engaged voters. Swing states receive more attention, leading to increased political discourse, and allowing for a more thoughtful and informed electorate. This system ultimately encourages candidates to listen to and address the concerns of citizens in these states, fostering a stronger connection between elected officials and the people they represent.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance out the influence of big states. The system ensures that large states do not have an overwhelming advantage over smaller states in the election process. The distribution of electoral votes provides a fairer representation of the population, allowing candidates to seek support from a broader range of states. Consequently, this balances power between states and prevents candidates from being solely focused on the interests of densely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. By avoiding run-off elections, which could complicate the presidential election process, the Electoral College maintains efficiency and stability in our electoral system.

While some argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in non-competitive states, studies have shown that voters still participate in elections even if their state is likely to favor one candidate over another. Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states and listen to the concerns of citizens across the country.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system. It ensures certainty, promotes inclusivity, encourages candidate engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big states, and reduces the need for run-off elections. While some proposed alternatives may offer changes to the system, they fail to address the core benefits and historical significance of the Electoral College. I urge you to consider these points when deliberating on this matter.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will represent the interests of your constituents while making decisions regarding our electoral process.

"Dear Senator, Electoral college may be a despised method to some people but it has been the system established by our founding fathers and remains until this day. It may not be perfect but every method has its flaws, including popular vote, respectively. The popular voting system is not the best method since it can end up not defining certainty of the outcome. Electoral college has prevailed until this day and it should remain this way for the United States of America.

Although electoral college may be called outdated, irrational and unfair Brandon Plumer 14. This isnt true because if it were so outdated and unfair it would have been substituted or changed by another system but it has remained because of its efficiency. This system is certainly not unfair because as stated in a article by Richard A. Posner,he explains ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed."" As for the irrational portion of the opposing view, as stated in "" in defense of the electoral college..."" article has multiple reasons but one of them is ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" No region South,Northeast,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" The single best argument against Electoral College may be called ""the disaster factor"" as claimed by Brandom Plumer in his article opposing the Electoral College. Certainty of Outcome is a strong point for Richard a. Posner in his article defending the electoral college and carefully states ""A dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" He Richard Posner also reminds the reader that the Electoral College avoids issues in elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast and there is no pressure for a ""runoff election"" when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

Another factor brought to our attention by ""the indefensible electoral college..."" article is that since the Electoral College uses the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont lose time in states they are most likely to not win in and they focus mostly on ""swing"" states. Although the ""swing"" states system is used, it is simply utilized becauseit induces the candidates as seen in 2012's election. But the voters in tossup states are most likely to pay more attention to the campaign, and it is decreed that the most thoughtful voters should be the chosen ones to decide the election.

Ultimately with all the information cited it is quite obvious which option is best for the U.S. Electoral College may have it's cons but the pros outweigh it. This is not a new method. It was defined by the Founding Fathers that wrote our constitution that has held our country in unisom until this day. Now in 2015 it is still the leading force in the government and should be kept that way. the Electoral college is the best suited for America and should'nt be altered.",0
"Dear Florida State Senator, The Electoral College needs to be disbanded. There are many reasons why the Electoral college needs to be stopped, but I will go over that later. How is it fair to Americans, if you say we have a vote that counts when we are just voting for a slate of people that might vote for someone we do not want. The voting process needs to be handled by the people, and who we want to run this country that we live in.

The voting process is just not fair to Americans. It's in the constitution that we have a right to vote and that we have the right to choose our president, but you people in the electoral college take away that right when we only get to vote for a slate of people. If elections were done by popular vote things might have been different in many ways. First off, in the 2000 election if it was done by popular vote, Bush would not have won and we would have had, Al Gore as president. The electoral college is just completely fair to voters. Because, in some states they have a winnertakeall system, so the presidential candidates to spend time in those states to get their vote. Seventeen States did not see the presidential candidates at all in 2000 campaign, so what is the point in having voting in those states if we dont know who we are voting for and why we are voting for them? There is not a reason to vote when the electoral college votes fore us.

Yes, sometimes people do not know what they are voting for and why, but that is because we have no say, it is not up to the people who is going to the president of the country of we live, because the electoral college will not let us choose who we want. Many people, very important people, such as Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and the U.S Chamber of commerce have agreed that we should abolish the Electoral College and give the people the vote and see who wins president then. If the people had a vote on who is president it would be very simpler, than the Electoral College when they have a tie, we would not have to bounce the decision, we could randomly choose one state and let them vote to see who the president is for 4 years. Yes, some may agrue that randomly choosing one state would somehow turn out to but a massive mistake, but there is a way to make sure that no state gets selected 2 times before the first time of any other state.

Many my agrue that, the Electoral college is there for our benefit. Tell me one benefit there is to having no vote as regular citizen. I get it that there are more people in some states than others, but that does not mean we all get the same number of electoral votes as the huge states such as, California, Florida, and Texas. So if we are not going to have the same votes number of votes no matter what why does it matter if we give the people the option and have them vote for who they want, it is because the Electoral College does not care who we want they choose the president on who they want. Also, if it is up to the Electoral College then why does it matter if the citizens vote, I mean of course we want to give our input of who we want, but it does not matter, because our state senators will go behind our back and vote for someone we do not want.

America, of course, has many more freedoms than other countries and we are not taking advantage of that, because we can not allow the people to vote for the President of the United States. The citizens do not want to vote for a slate of people, they want to vote for our president.",0
"There are so many advantages of limiting car usage. In source one, the vaughn's streets are completely ""carfree"". This is for the good of not cluttering the streets with so many cars but actually making more space and less cars on the streets. In source one, it says ""while there hace been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs."" That right there says they have been trying to reduce car usage for a while now and convince citizens that transportation can be better to use. Instead of having over a million cars on the streets or high ways or anywhere, many people can come together and take transportation train or bus to where ever they need to go. It also makes time for walking, which is a very good exercise. Many people have become lazy and take their car to drive to the store thats right there on the corner instead of walking. Many people have taken car usage over the limits and don't realize how it is polluting our air.

Pollution is a big problem in our ecosystem now and days. Many people don't clearly see this and don't take the time to process in how bad its making earth. Pollution has gone up over the years and decades after decades we have tried to stop it. In source two, it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals."" Why? Well because of the exaggerated use of cars. They have tried to reduce the usage in order to make their air cleaner and better. They have gotten the idea of limiting car usage by ordering people with evennumbered license plates to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine on Mondays. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. With this new policy, it has shown better air in the city of Paris by Monday. I believe this is a great forced rule. We need to change our ways and work better in making our air cleaner.

Traffic jams is another downfall of using cars. With so many cars out in the streets it causes the air to have so much smog. Many people have participated in bike riding and walking, but not only is it exercise for your health but it keeps away from people using their cars. With so many people participating this action, not only has it made better air burt also constructed and cropped up new restaurants and shopping districts. They cleared the side walk to make it smoother and cut traffic, as said in source three. This is all in Bogota, Columbia. They said it has made a drastic change in their community with better air and I believe it has made their air better and way reduced smog.

In the United States, President Obama's goal was to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to many people participating in this action. A very big amount of Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less and fewer licences as each year goes by as said in source four. To keep this at a going rate each year I believe citizens should work harder to improve more in this situation as in car pooling, bicycle and public transportation.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages in reducing car usage. Better air, better community and healthier citizens.",0
"The Electoral College gives certain states, based on their popularity, a number of how many of what I guess can be called ""points"" that will go to to the candidate that gets the most votes for themself out of that state. Now whether that is a good idea or not is completely based on your own opion which you can decide. But I disagree with the Electoral College, even though it did take me a while of thinking I came to the conclusion that an all out popular vote is more efficient when it comes to voting for a president than the electoral college, and there is three main reasons that swung me to side with popular vote, First of all, when you get right down to it the Electoral College just doesnt give perfect accuracy on who does actually get the exact most votes. Some people cant completely grasp this fact but imagine that there is Florida, Alaska, and Montana. The first candidate, which we shall call John and the second, Bill, are going for these three states. John beats Bill on Florida 5,000 to 4,999 and John gets all 29 electoral votes because of that, tough luck for Bill. Luckily for Bill he sweeps over John in Alaska 100 to 0 and montana 100 0 and gets 3 points from each state which gives him 6 points total. So now by popular vote Bill would win with 5,199 votes against John's 5,000. But since Bill only has 6 Electoral points because he still lost Florida, which was the state John won and got a whopping 29 points from, Bill will lose his campaign to John 296 because thats what the amazing ""wonders"" of the Electoral College are. Which basically sums up how in 2000 Al Gore lost to Bill Gates even that Al Gore had more overall votes.

The Electoral College also makes candidates have to strategically plan out their campaign so they can focus on big states and swing states only. If a candidate knows he will not win a certain state he wont even focus on it because it would be pointless, even if he changes maybe a couple thousand voters' minds, it wont get him a single point if he loses that state 5000 15000 whereas with popular vote changing the mind of people so that you get yourself from having 10% of California's overall votes for you to 30% means more votes than literally all of alaskans eligible voting population. So that drives candidates away from states they wont win and they go to states known as ""swing states"" that dont have a specific party that they vote for every election, and they will attempt to win these states votes the most because those points will make the biggest difference.

The final thing I'd like to touch on is that the Electoral College system takes so many peoples idea and erases it. We want our vote to mean something throughout the whole campaign, but it doesnt matter if you are one the few democrat supporters in an overall republican dominated state because when your state loses 5000 to 150, poof! There goes your vote floating off into oblivion because it doesnt matter now, your one vote doesnt stand a chance against 50 going against it according to the Electoral College. We want our vote to count for the candidate himself not be part of some majorly flawed point system that someone thought would help somehow when picking the right candidate to become the head honcho sitting in charge of The White House, Our Country, and be the overall leader of our military forces too. So we need our vote to be heard and for it to actually count, even if 5000 more people disagree with 2500 in the same state, those 2500 votes should actually count towards something instead of being overrun and erased by the 5000 which will earn some candidate a couple of points for their campaign.

Now after all this not only has my own opinion strongly changed in favor of popular vote but I hope yours has too. Electoral College just doesnt provide that actual perfect accuracy of who wins that popular does, it forces presidents to only visit and campaign in certain states that they have a chance of winning, and it takes citizens votes and throws them down the drain if more people in the same state vote differently. It just makes you sit and wonder whos idea it was to accept this system.",0
"It is hard to imagine carfree or car limiting cities, but it could happen in the near future. Many people like owning and driving cars. However, cars are causing major problems in some areas of the world, so we could see less cars in the future.

One of the biggest issues that cars cause is the carbon emissions that they release. In America, the second largest source of emissions are from cars Source 4. This doesn't seem like an issue to Americans, but in places like Beijing, China, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world Source 2, emissions are very harmful. Citizens of Beijing have to wear mask when they walk around the city so that they don't get sick or poisoned from the carbon emissions. Even a 1st world country, like France, had carbon emissions that rivaled BeijingSource 2. So as you can see, the emissions that cars give off could become a more serious issue in America, especially if you live in a place like New York City. If more cities become less congested, they will be much safer.

Speaking of New York City, cars are already a big issue. If you have been to New York City, you should know that the streets are so congested with traffic that it is faster to walk or ride a bike to get around the city. Not only are the streets congested, the air is very polluted from the emissions given off by cars. However, in Vauban, Germany, residents are giving up their cars for streets that are mostly ""carfree"" Source 1. Few residents own cars and that means that the streets are quiet and clear and greenhouse emission have drastically decreased. Residents say that they are happier without cars and everything they need is within walking distance Source 1. This could quite possibly be what happens to many cities and suburbs in the near future.

The last thing that I would like to fill you in on is that car ownership in America has been steadily declining. Research has shown that the number of young people driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 Source 4. Because of this, many people use Public Transport to get where they need to go. This is likely due to the fact that many Americans don't have the money to buy cars, so they don't make it a priority Source 4. Also, young people feel less inclined to drive because they can connect with their friends through the internet Source 4.

By no means am I saying that you should not own a car, I'm am just explaining to you that a carlimited future is looking more and more possible. In many ways it could be very beneficial, but it still has a long way to go before I can see it becoming reality.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog illustrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and smog levels. By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can not only improve air quality but also create healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to alternative transportation options. The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1
"Vroom, vroom goes the 1998 Chevy Impala next to you at the stop light. Driving has become apart of culture that is standard to the developed world. But the culture is slowly changing because the driving epidemic is becoming limited. Cars can be very expensive, harmful to the environment, and troublesome. Limiting car usage can help the environment, help finances, and reduce stress.

Cars are defined as metal cases with leather seats powered by gas or diseal. Gas and diesel are fuels that are harmful to the Earth and can cause harmful emission and greenhouse gases. These gasses can cause smog, or smoke and fog mixed together creating a grey cloud of unbreathable dense air. Smog is very harmful for the environment and can heat the Earth which is not the ideal for the human body. In France, smog, caused by car emissions became unbearable, thus causing the entire city of Paris to ban cars for five days. According to Robert Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"" Paris Bans Driving due to Smog Paragraph 14. Therefore cars and its horrible blow can cause a blanket of harmful reactant. Cars can also cause greenhouse gases which is when the heat of the day and the cool of the night trap in the harmful emissions of a car. These greenhouse gases can also heat the Earth and can harm humans. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" CarFree Cities Paragraph 5. In effort to save the Earth and the human race many cities and communities have adopted carbanning, reducing the amount of population caused buy cars.

A 2014 Lincoln MKX runs about 45,000, which is the equivalent to the salary of a high school teacher annually. Cars can be very expensive to buy, maintain, and to fuel. The price of oil is about 2.45 today. But over the past few years gas prices have fluctuated up to almost 4.00 a gallon. The average driver might buy gas every two weeks at 20 gallons, that equals 116 a month for gas. The money used to fuel the car has turned into a gas bill, not to mention the sparatic mishaps that can happen while on the road. Cars today have become an investment instead of a luxury. Although, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,"" does not mean it should remain. The advance in technology and resources has allowed people to reduce the use of cars, and ultimately save themselves money. For example, many people have coworkers that live near one another. Thus, both persons can carpool on alternate days. Mimi Sheller suggests, ""the Internet makes telecommunting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends End of Car Culture Paragraph 35. It is much easier and cheaper to carpool, take the bus, or take the subway. Limiting car usage would save money because more young people are ""interestedin driving, but it's not a prority."" Therefore, parents do not have to spend 30,000 on a new car for their 16 year old. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009,"" which is putting money back into the pockets of parents and public transportation companies The End of Car Culture Paragraph 39.

Road rage is the disease the that overtakes a person when another person is driving idiotically. Road rage is sitting at a green light at a complete stop because the person in front of you is too busy texting their BFF. Road rage is caused by driving. Driving can cause stress because cars are out of your control, traffic is out of your control, and time is out your control. When things are out of control, human nature is to panic. Driving is not the time nor the place to panic. Limiting car usage can reduce the effects of this stress caused by driving because there would be less people on the road, less traffic, and less crashes. Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Car Free Cities Paragraph 3. Less cars means less drivers which then means a safer environment for pedestrians. Less cars means less traffic which means no more road rage. Less cars means less cars because there are less reckless drivers grazing the road. Limiting car usage can also make people come closer together because it forces them to interact in order to get around. For instance, instead of hopping into you 2013 Camry you call an old friend who happens to work on a different floor of your office building. This interaction can spark a new realtionship and brightens your day. Cars and driving causes stress because it is out of control, but if cars are limited then the stressed caused by driving will be reduced.

Road rage, smog, and tickets, driving is the mush pot of the many problems of this world. Limiting car usage can save the planet, save money, and save you blood from boiling. The priviledge of driving has been taken advantage of and has caused the world to decay at its own expense. The human race has the ability remit from the tragdey of cars one city at a time.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. In Vauban, Germany, residents have given up their cars and have found that their overall quality of life has improved. The streets of Vauban are completely car-free, with the exception of the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to this car-free community. Residents have found that living without cars has reduced their stress and made them happier overall. This experiment in low-car suburban life is being adopted in other areas to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation.

Limiting car usage is also an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, that number can be as high as 50%. By separating suburban life from auto use, as seen in Vauban and other car-free communities, we can make significant strides in reducing these emissions.

Cities around the world are also implementing measures to limit car usage. Paris, for instance, recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and the same applied to odd-numbered plates the following day. As a result, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent and the smog cleared enough for the ban to be lifted. This demonstrates that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for the environment, but also for public health and safety.

Bogota, Colombia has taken it a step further by implementing an annual car-free day. Millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work on this day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This program has been successful in Bogota and has even spread to other countries. Municipal authorities from other countries have come to Bogota to see the event and have been enthusiastic about the potential for change.

In the United States, there is also a growing shift in behavior when it comes to car usage. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Researchers believe this may be a fundamental shift in American culture and could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, so reducing car usage can have a significant impact. The car industry may need to adapt to this cultural shift by offering a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. Not only does it improve the overall quality of life for residents, but it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves public health and safety, and promotes alternative transportation options. As we continue to see successful examples of car-free communities and initiatives around the world, it is clear that limiting car usage is an effective solution for a more sustainable future.",1

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College or Changing to Election by Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to advocate for the retention of the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While there are strong arguments calling for a shift towards election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, the Electoral College system ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As we saw in the 2000 election, a dispute over the popular vote can create significant unrest and uncertainty. In contrast, the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of such disputes by awarding the winning candidate the necessary number of electoral votes to secure the presidency. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding prolonged legal battles and potential political instability.

Another essential aspect of the Electoral College is that it guarantees that the president is the choice of the entire nation, rather than just a few densely populated regions. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no region can dominate the election process. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on select areas and encourages them to campaign and address the concerns of voters across the entire country. As a result, the president elected through the Electoral College is seen as everyone's president, representing the interests of the entire nation.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method employed by the Electoral College directs campaign efforts towards swing states. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the issues and concerns of diverse regions, rather than exclusively focusing on high-population areas. By doing so, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced and comprehensive approach to governing that takes into account the needs of different states and regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College system offers a fair balance of power between large and small states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may give smaller states less influence in the national government, the Electoral College allows larger states to regain some weight in the political balance. This ensures that presidential candidates are not solely focused on areas with high populations but also engage with voters in less populous states. Such inclusivity is crucial in maintaining a representative democracy that values the voices of all its citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College provides a clear winner by awarding the presidency to the candidate with the majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and costs associated with conducting additional rounds of voting, ultimately ensuring a smooth and efficient electoral process.

While the arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system are compelling, it is crucial not to overlook the benefits that the Electoral College provides. By ensuring a certain outcome, representing the entire nation, focusing campaign efforts on swing states, balancing power between large and small states, and minimizing the need for runoff elections, the Electoral College upholds the principle of fairness and ensures the stability of our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate all the benefits of the Electoral College system when making decisions that will impact our electoral process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, called ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative transportation methods. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more accessible and vibrant communities.

One of the major benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to the efforts to combat climate change.

Another advantage is the improvement in air quality. The burning of fossil fuels in cars releases pollutants that can have detrimental effects on human health. By limiting car usage, we can reduce air pollution and create cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.

Limiting car usage also encourages physical activity and promotes a healthier lifestyle. When people rely more on walking, biking, or public transportation, they are more likely to engage in physical activity on a daily basis. This can have positive effects on personal health, including reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more accessible and vibrant communities. In car-centric suburbs, stores and amenities are often spread out, causing people to rely heavily on cars to get around. However, by adopting a smart planning approach and placing stores within walking distance or near public transportation, we can create more compact and pedestrian-friendly communities. This not only makes it easier for people to access what they need, but it also promotes social interaction and a sense of community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas has numerous advantages. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more accessible communities, we can create a sustainable and enjoyable living environment for everyone. As we continue to adopt smart planning strategies, it is important to prioritize alternative transportation methods and work towards a future with fewer cars on the road.",1
"limiting car usage is an advantage for many reasons, for example, the pollution will become less of a problem, people will be less tense, and we will be devoid of traffic jams, which means less car accidents. To me cars are just something to get you to point A to B, but now that I have read these articles I realize that cars are alot worse for the environment then i thought, and that i should try using of ways of transportation.

In the passage it states ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The pollution was out of control and for the most part it was because of the huge amount of car usage. The effect of banning car usage was resulting in an amazing outcome, less pollution, which is healthier for the community. The advantage of limiting car usage can effect a whole community and one way is less pollution. Bogota, Colombia had the same idea but they were not banning the car usage they have one day called the carfree day to show that its an advantage not to use cars all the time.

Limiting car usage can even make you less tense, as said in the article,"" ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,""said Heidrum Walter, a media trainerand mother of two, as she walker verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Everything is better when car usage is limited it, makes you less tense and less pollution."" "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" When there is less cars on the road there is less possiblity of car accidents or traffic jams.""... leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" During the one day of no car usage, the streets were left of no traffic jams or accidents. The world is a better place with limited car usage. "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" To conclude, the limited car usage is a great way to reduce the amount of pollution, become less tense , and creat less possibility to have car accidents or road jams. After reading these article I have realized that taking othe transportations like bicycle or on foot could have huge impacts on the environment and my own well being.",0
"Dear Senator of Florida, What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the ""WinnerTakeAll"" system does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election?

Their has been many mishappens because of the Electoral College. For example, from an excerpt called ""The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong"" says ""The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worst."" This shows that the electoral college does do damage to the United States because they let a huge crisis happen during the elections. They could have let it get even worst because they allow it to and make it easy to make things worst in certain crisis.

I feel like you should give the people more of a say because half of the people that vote probably don't even know that they are not actually voting for the president. They probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college to see who will end up on the board. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters. Voters pay to vote, to what pay the Electoral College to vote and make their say so important it is sad. The reason it is sad is because all kids want to do when their younger is vote because they feel like it symbolizes them growing up and like they get a real say in who the next president is or the senate anything just as longs as they get a say. But truthful their not getting a say in who will be the next senate, treasurer, or president their actually picking the board who will be picking for them.

Even the People once wanted to abolish the Electoral College. These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong."" is sates ""They're not alone according to a gallop poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore thanks the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" It also states that ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. They practicly alredy know who is going to win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has it all planned out.

So really thier is no need for the Electoral College because all they do is make the competion unfair for the other person going for the election. Also, because they have cause or been a part of problems and mishappens. In an article it mentions ""Perhaps moat worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, were staes delegation vote on president."" Also, when you are voting for the VicePresident you are not actually voting the senat picks who the VicePresident is. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters and the people running in the election.",0
"Zroom! Cars have been developing for hundreds of years all over the world. They have become very dangerous to the environment and there are many advantages to limiting the use of them.

There is only so much space on earth and lot of it is taken up by parking. No matter where you go there will always be parking spots on the fertile ground that we need to preserve. Garages, street parking, and driveways not only house vehicles but they also take up valuable space! By limiting the use of cars we can cut back on the land wasted to house them.

Another important advantage to limiting car use is that it will save you money! Everyday we hear about a new car that just came on the market but the price only keeps on increasing. No one wants a cheap car that they are embaresseed to be seen in and many pay vigorously for new upgrades. The biggest expense is gas, which you will have to pay for almost everyday as the price keeps rising.

Finally, car usage is extremely bad for the environment. Paris is in days of nearrecord pollution and its become so bad that they had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. Every time you start your car smog comes out of your exhaust polluting the air. After awhile it falls back to the ground and sticks so when it rains the roads become very slick which is a major hazard.

In conclusion, we should all limit the use of cars. Although its ok to use them in moderation they are still space consuming, expensive, and bad for the environment.",0
"When it comes to voting citizens from all over the country wonder if the Electoral College , ""winnertakeall"" system is the best way to choose our president. The obvious answer is yes. The Electoral College system was established by the founding fathers years ago and its been working perfectly fine untill present date.

Electing our president through electoral votes takes care of minor problems such as favorism of regions.Each state is giving electoral votes based on their population , no region such as south, north, east, ect.. has enough electoral votes to choose a president.source 3 paragraph 19 "" So a solid regional favorite, such as rodney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"" A president with a favorite region may make the rest of the country feel like their votes doesn't count and the new president will show no attention to their interests and their problems. Electing our presidents via Electoral College is the best way to make our country feel like our president is everyones president.

Most americans may prefer a direct election over the kind we have now. source 2: paragraph 9 ""... according to a poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency"" Americans think that by choosing our leader by popular vote their votes will be represented more. Americans are also scared of a tie between candidates since the electoral vote numer is a even number 538 in total but they only need 270 to win the elections. They shouldnt be worried about this a tie could happen but is mostlikely never going to happen. The biggest complain about the winner take all system is that it is unfair to voters since candidates campaign in big states or states with a lot of electoral votes , they dont spend time on states they know they have no chance of winning. source 2: paragraph 13 ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" but this isn't completely true , the winner take all method motivates candidates to focus their efforts on the "" tossup "" states. Voters in these states really listen to the competeting candidates knowing they are responsible for deciding the election. ""But of course no voter's vote swings a national election.."" ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election "" source 3: paragraph 23 One persons vote is not going to decide the election so no matter what point of view yu look at it from , electoral vote is the best way to choose our leader.",0
"Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go ""down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog."" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians ""hiked, biked, skated..."" during their carfree days source 3. Also, many ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city"" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may ""buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1."" Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said ""I'm much happier this way source 1,"" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of retaining this system for electing the president of the United States. While there are valid concerns raised about the Electoral College, such as its lack of direct democracy and the potential for discrepant outcomes between the popular vote and the electoral vote, there are compelling reasons for keeping this system intact.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a direct popular vote, where disputes over the vote count are more likely to occur, the Electoral College system minimizes the potential for such disputes. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This lessens the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote and provides a clear winner in the election.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is not just a regional favorite, but rather someone with trans-regional appeal. Each region in the United States does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates need to appeal to voters from various regions in order to secure the majority of electoral votes. This requirement promotes the representation and consideration of interests from all regions, preventing a president from being solely focused on a specific region's concerns.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to campaign heavily in swing states. As Judge Posner emphasizes, tossing-up states are the ones where the election is ultimately decided. Consequently, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, thoroughly evaluate the competing candidates' proposals, and make informed decisions. This increased attention from voters in swing states raises the overall level of thoughtful voting, which is desirable for selecting the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system restores some balance to the political weight of large states that lose representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In a popular vote scenario, large states would enjoy even more influence, potentially overshadowing the interests and needs of smaller states. By awarding electoral votes proportionally to each state's population, bigger states still receive more attention from candidates in campaigns, but not to the point that their influence becomes disproportionate.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the necessity of run-off elections. This is particularly important in cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College system tends to produce a clear winner, eliminating the need for extended and potentially costly run-off elections.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it discourages potential voters in states where they believe their vote will have no effect on the outcome. However, as Judge Posner points out, voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference, rather than ones who believe that a single vote may decide the election. Despite this perceived limitation, voter turnout in the 2012 election reached approximately 50% of the eligible American population, suggesting that voters are still motivated to participate in the electoral process.

In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns with the Electoral College system related to its lack of direct democracy and the potential discrepancies between the popular vote and electoral vote, the system serves several important purposes. It ensures certainty in the outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages campaigning in swing states, restores balance in representation, and eliminates the need for run-off elections.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I implore you to seriously ponder the advantages of the Electoral College when evaluating potential changes to the current system. The preservation of this process is crucial to maintaining a fair and effective means of selecting our nation's president.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This can be seen in examples such as the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris due to smog, and the success of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. By reducing car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change. The example of car-free communities like Vauban, where only 30% of families own cars, shows that it is possible to live without cars and still have a high quality of life.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris highlights how smog levels significantly decreased when cars were restricted. Smog is a major issue in many cities around the world, and car emissions contribute to this problem. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation, such as biking, walking, or public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Promoting alternative forms of transportation is another advantage of limiting car usage. The passage mentions how in Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. This not only promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle but also reduces the need for cars for everyday tasks. Similarly, the car-free days in Bogota encourage people to utilize buses, bikes, or skates for their daily commute. By providing and improving alternative transportation options, we can reduce congestion on the roads and make transportation more accessible for everyone.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. The passage about Vauban highlights how the absence of cars has created a peaceful and pleasant environment, where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children can be heard instead of motor noise. This creates a safer and more enjoyable community for residents. Additionally, car-free zones and pedestrian-friendly streets can encourage social interactions, support local businesses, and improve the overall quality of life in a neighborhood.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive effects of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning strategies and encouraging alternative transportation options, we can build a future that is less dependent on cars and more focused on sustainable and healthy living.",1
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and promote healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. This trend is already being seen in various parts of the world, including German suburb Vauban, Paris, and Bogota.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number increases to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that separate themselves from car use, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a decline in congestion. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces the time people spend in their cars, improving productivity and quality of life. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced during periods of severe pollution, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can have a direct impact on reducing traffic and improving air quality.

Limiting car usage also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This shift has led to people adopting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and using public transportation. These activities not only contribute to increased physical activity but also reduce air pollution and reliance on fossil fuels.

Additionally, limiting car usage encourages the development of more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This concept is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, making suburbs more pedestrian-friendly and reducing the need for large parking spaces. By creating more walkable communities, we can promote social interaction, support local businesses, and reduce the need for excessive car usage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can positively impact individuals and the environment. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, alleviates traffic congestion, promotes healthier lifestyles, and fosters the development of sustainable communities. As seen in various examples around the world, including Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, the shift towards limiting car usage is gaining traction and proving to be beneficial for both present and future generations. It is important for citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that promote alternative modes of transportation.",1
"Dear Senator, I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.

First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur over a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 percent rodney received. Because of the winnertakeall basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory.

Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winnertakeallmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the candidate to focus campaigning in tossup states. These voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likely to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the malapportion,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

A reason for not keeping the electoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is that electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the candidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.

In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.",0
"The electoral college has been a part of the united states for many years. The founding fathers were the ones who established it in the constitution. The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. If you are reading this senator of state I hope this letter will support your opinion on this or make you consider popular vote.

The united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states. With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the opposing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in all the states, because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only focus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisements all over the country.

Even though the popular vote is a good way to go I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect. The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and should be used in future elections. If you have read this senator I hope this might have changed or supported your opinion on this topic.",0
"The idea of reducing car usage is a good idea, because the environment would be a better place. Limiting cars will not only benefit us with the idea of air pollution but with obesity, and obesity is a big thing in the United States. Its amazing how may people care about there environment. In source 3, Bogota, Colombia millions of columbians hike, bike, skate, or took buses to work during a day they call carfree day because they want to reduce air pollution.

In the United States one out of every 4 person is obese, and the reduction of car usage will help limit the obesity rate. Walking or even biking from one place to another is a work out and that is a common way to lose weight. We try so hard to reduce obesity and one of the many ways to gain weight is to eat junk food and not jog, run, or walk it off. So reducing the limit of cars is a good idea to reduce the obesity rate in the United States.

The reduction of cars will help the air polluting situation in the U.S. The pollution in the air will later in the future bit us right on the rear end. Many people may believe its happening now. The main cause of air pollution is the fuel we have running on our cars that are on the road 247. If we limit the usage of cars now we will start to see the difference in our world today.

Many people dont really use cars in the United States in source 4 it states that study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between the years of 2001 and 2009. It also stated that in 2005 the number of miles driven dropped steadily. Each year in America people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by a recent studies found. So believe or not not many people don't need a car to get to point A to point B.

As of today we should make a effort to stop using our cars and maybe walk to work and get your exercise for the day while doing it. Let make a change together and stop the mass of air pollution we have going on and and reduce the rate of obesity. Lets make our country a better place to be.",0
"In the world today you will see cars just about everywhere, whether it be a toyota pirus, or an 1999 honda civic. Car no doubly have been one of the largest, if not, the greatest inventions this world has ever seen. Although nowadays when we start to talk negativially about the car, people seem to turn their heads away to avoid the question. Reducing the use of cars in the world would be massively beneficial to the environment, and not only that, everyday life. Limiting car usage will help reduce pollution into the atmosphere through reducing carbon emissions, it will help save money and also it will help reduce stress and tense mindset.

One of the largest benefits of reducing car usage in the world is the reduction of greenhouse gases being released in to the atmosphere coming out the exhaust pipes of cars. According to In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from cars in car congested areas. In the passage the text explains how a social experiment turned into a growing trend in Europe today. In suburban town of Vauban, many people have utitmatly given up their cars. How this was done you may ask? In the town driveways are forbidden swell as home garages. Car Ownership isnt forbidden though,but to own a car is quite difficult and costly. With only two places to park in the whole town, it makes ownership very difficult. The lifestyle of people here without cars ultimately reduced stress and increased health, and much happier and healthier lifestyles were made. Another example will be in Paris, France. After the city received near recordbreaking pollution in the air, Paris officials took action. They banned driving for two days to attempt to reduce carbon emissions. The way they enforced this rule was by fines throughout the city for no cooperation. On that monday on the first day of the ban, only 4000 fines were given. Many people were complained of inconvience and companies complained of lost revenue, Although the incovencies, the ban for just one day reduced the smog almost completely and allowed for Pairs to lift the scheduled ban on that tuesday. So even though in some places the reduction of car usage may cause incovience, the reduction carbon emissions cant go unnoticed, and it is huge advantage.

Reduction of the usage of cars will not only reduce Greenhouse gases but it will also help people conserve and save money and stay stress free. Limiting car usage will save you money a couple ways, one of which is not having to fuel up your car to save money. Fuel prices are always moving up and down, but more recently they have been very high. For many people they are spending over 50 dollars at the pump just to dirve 50 or so miles. With reduction of car usage people wont have to spend as much money at the pump. Reduction of car usage will also help reduce spending money because it wont allow to buy things at certain stores that you have to drive too, and things like that. Another advantage of the reduction of the usage of the car is the reduce in stress for a person. In town of Vauban, Heidrun Waltert said, ""When I had a car, i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" This way he mean the way without a car.",0
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place rather than switching to a popular vote system. 

One of the main reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear and decisive outcome. This reduces the chances of extended legal battles and potential chaos that could arise from a close popular vote result. 

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that each region of the country is represented and heard. As noted by Judge Posner, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates must have trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of voters from different parts of the country. This helps prevent a candidate with limited regional appeal from being elected and promotes the idea that the president should represent the entire nation.

The Electoral College also incentivizes candidates to focus on swing states, as discussed by Judge Posner. These states are crucial in deciding the outcome of the election and receive heightened attention from candidates during campaigns. This ensures that voters in swing states have a greater opportunity to engage with the candidates and make informed decisions. 

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. Large states, by population, have an advantage in the political balance due to their higher number of electoral votes. This helps to counterbalance the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as explained by Judge Posner. By giving more weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to their concerns and issues.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional voting rounds and simplifies the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who have no hope of carrying their state, the information provided in these texts suggests that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will decide the outcome. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves an important role in our presidential elections. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures regional representation, promotes attention to swing states, balances the influence of different-sized states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. These reasons, along with the arguments presented in the texts, support the case for keeping the Electoral College. I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating any proposals for change.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: In Favor of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College intact as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue that this system is outdated and undemocratic, I believe that it serves important purposes that should not be overlooked. In this letter, I will outline the reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be preserved, addressing counterclaims and providing evidence from multiple sources.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system used by most states, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of prolonged legal battles and disputes over the results of the election.

Another crucial benefit of the Electoral College is that it requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as outlined by Judge Posner. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to voters across different regions. This results in a president who is more likely to represent the interests of all Americans, rather than just those of a specific region. It also ensures that residents in all regions feel enfranchised and have a stake in the election process.

The Electoral College also maintains the importance of swing states, as highlighted by Judge Posner. In an election, the candidates focus their campaign efforts on these swing states since they hold the key to victory. This approach encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful voters. By allowing swing states to have a significant impact on the election, the Electoral College ensures a more engaged and informed electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a balance of power for big states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. Despite the mal-apportionment of the Senate, where small states have an equal number of senators as large states, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates. In a campaign, a candidate is more likely to invest time and resources in a large state with a significant number of electoral votes. This helps to ensure that the concerns and needs of citizens in larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the necessity of run-off elections, as argued by Judge Posner. Run-off elections can significantly complicate the presidential election process. By providing a clear winner, the Electoral College avoids the need for such run-off elections and ensures a smoother transition of power.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidates have no hope of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely determined by the election system. In the 2012 election, approximately half of the eligible American population voted, despite the fact that no single vote swings a national election. People who participate in presidential elections typically have a desire to express their political preference rather than expecting their vote to decide the outcome. The Electoral College does not diminish the significance of voting but rather maintains the balance between regional and national interests.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important purposes that should be considered before any decision to change the election system is made. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. The arguments against the Electoral College are based on assertions that lack a strong basis in reality, as argued by Judge Posner. Therefore, I urge you to consider these factors and support the preservation of the Electoral College in our democratic system.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my views into consideration when deliberating on the future of our election system.

Sincerely,

Dear [Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and argue against changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have thoroughly studied and analyzed the information and perspectives provided in various texts, and I believe that the Electoral College system has several benefits and should be maintained.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, who vote for the President and Vice President based on the state's popular vote. Each state's allotment of electors is determined by the number of representatives in the House of Representatives, plus two for the Senators.

One of the advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winner of the electoral vote usually exceeds their share of the popular vote, preventing close contests. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that a slight plurality in a state results in a substantial electoral victory, preventing ties in the nationwide electoral vote.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it demands trans-regional appeal from presidential candidates. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Consequently, candidates must appeal to voters from various regions, preventing the concentration of power in one area. This encourages a president-elect to represent the interests of all regions and fosters a sense of inclusivity.

The focus on swing states is another advantage of the Electoral College system. Candidates direct their campaign efforts towards states where the electoral vote outcome is uncertain. This encourages voters in swing states to pay closer attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. Elections should be decided by those who have thoroughly considered the candidates' policies and qualifications, and swing states provide voters with that opportunity.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states have less weight in the political process. However, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to these states during the campaign. Even if the popular vote is close, as exemplified by Florida in 2012, winning a large state results in a significant number of electoral votes.

Finally, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This avoids the complications and costs associated with organizing run-off elections and ensures a decisive result. As we have seen in the past, candidates who win a majority in the Electoral College but only a plurality of the popular vote can effectively govern and lead the nation.

While the arguments against the Electoral College have been raised, such as the potential disenfranchisement of voters in non-competitive states and the perceived undemocratic nature of the system, the practical benefits of the Electoral College outweigh these concerns. It is important to weigh the historical significance and the intent of the founding fathers in establishing this system, aiming to create a more balanced and representative democracy.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages attention to swing states, balances the political influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These practical advantages support the retention of the Electoral College system. I urge you to consider these points when weighing the decision on whether to keep or change our current method of electing the president.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my arguments into account when considering the future of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage in society has been gaining momentum in recent years. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote more sustainable modes of transportation. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging alternatives to car travel, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to combating climate change.

Another benefit of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In the passage about Paris banning driving due to smog, it is stated that after implementing a partial driving ban, congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent. This reduction in car usage resulted in cleaner air and a decrease in pollution levels. By limiting car usage, especially in urban areas with high population density, we can create healthier environments for residents and reduce the negative impact of vehicle emissions on respiratory health.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, highlights how smart planning can result in the development of neighborhoods where cars are not the primary mode of transportation. Instead, residents have access to public transportation, walkable streets, and local amenities within a short distance from their homes. This approach helps reduce the need for long car commutes and promotes a more sustainable and efficient use of space.

Moreover, by limiting car usage, we can also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and promote a more sustainable energy system. As mentioned in the passage about the end of car culture, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, indicating a potential cultural shift away from personal vehicle ownership. This shift presents an opportunity to explore alternative modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, shared transportation services, and improved public transit systems. These alternatives can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities. By promoting alternatives to car travel and implementing smart planning strategies, we can make significant progress toward a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society. It is crucial for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace these ideas and work together to limit car usage for the benefit of our planet and future generations.",1
"Limiting car usage has several advantages that can greatly benefit society. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. According to the passages, cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By limiting car usage, we can greatly decrease these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health. The passage about Paris implementing a driving ban due to smog highlights the negative consequences of car usage on air quality. The smog in Paris reached levels comparable to that of Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. This can have serious health implications for residents, as polluted air can lead to respiratory problems and other illnesses. By limiting car usage, we can improve air quality and promote better health outcomes for the population.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help improve urban planning and create more sustainable communities. The passage about the German suburb, Vauban, shows how car-free streets and limited parking can create a more accessible and walkable community. This new approach to suburban life is being adopted globally, with the goal of making suburbs more compact and connected to public transportation. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing the dependence on cars, these communities become more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential economic benefits. While there may be initial challenges and resistance, such as lost revenue for delivery companies, the long-term economic effects could be positive. The End of Car Culture passage mentions how car companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies. This shift in focus indicates a recognition of changing consumer behavior and a greater emphasis on alternative modes of transportation. In addition, the passage mentions that young people are driving less and becoming less interested in car ownership. This trend could have implications for the car industry, as fewer cars are being purchased. However, it also opens up opportunities for other sectors such as public transportation and shared mobility services.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, better urban planning, and potential economic benefits. By adopting smarter planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation options, and creating more walkable communities, we can reap these advantages and create a more sustainable future.",1
"There have been a few close calls during our presidential election over the past decades, but it doesn't mean it's enough to scratch it out and throw it away. We should keep the Electoral College for many reasons, but mostly to keep chaos from happening.

To begin with, the Electoral College has been the method we have used for years for choosing our next President, so why would we change it now? Well, the answer is we shouldn't. It may seem like a good idea at first to change to the election by popular vote, but here's the problem. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral College is what helps the candidates from winning from a landslide. The Electoral consists of 583 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. So even though some may say you're not choosing your President, you're actually helping to chose your President. When you vote you're actually voting for an elector that will most likely vote for the candidate to your appeal.

Furthermore, many people such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and even the Chamber of Commerce have agreed to abolish the Electoral College. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Although, this all may seem like a time for change, isn't the Electoral College doing us a favor? ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" The Electoral College is a process, as a compromise established by our founding fathers, between election of the President by a vote in cCongress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

Last, but not least, the Electoral College helps with voting for President. ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed."" It is possible for the winner to win the electoral vote, but will not win the national popular vote. ""The Electoral College requires a candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" ""So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, that he knows he will will."" Therefor, he will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in those states in favor of him. ""This is a desirable result because the candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.

All in all, we should keep the Electoral College because it helps balance out the nation's amount of votes for a good successful President that will help it's people.",0
"Many people in the United States are becoming more and more aware of the advantages of limiting car usage. Many don't find this important or feel uncomfortable adapting new customs but it is very important to limit car usage. Limiting car usage contributes to many factors in cities and can also help the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage contributes to the way cities, towns, or suburbs are. For example The first article ""CarFree Cities"" shows an example of a suburb in Germany where people have given up their cars. This suburb Vauban, Germany, has been a success and even 57 percent of the people living there have sold their cars in order to live there, while 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars. A media trainer, Heidrn Walter, said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I', much happier this way,"" and it's not only her that feels this way, many other people in this suburb have experienced and enjoyed the nocarfeeling. Also, this article states that a lowcar suburban life makes suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. This makes living there a lot more easier and comfortable.

Second, limiting car usage helps the environment. According to the first article ""CarFreeCities"" says that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" and that ""emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" These two facts show how bad cars are for the environment, and not only that, but also, cars polute the air horribly. For example, in the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" said that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This smog has affected a lot of cities as well and now one of the main goals people have is to promote alternative transportation due to this.

To conclude, there are many advantages of limiting car usage and and not limiting is hurting the world. Everyone should be more considerate of their environment and limit their car usage.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various cities around the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the experiences of communities like Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia.

Vauban, an experimental community in Germany, has implemented strict regulations on car ownership and parking. While car ownership is allowed, residents are only permitted to park in large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and serene environment, with streets filled only with bicycles and pedestrians. This has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, as automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe.

Similarly, Paris has enforced driving bans during periods of intense smog to reduce pollution levels. In these instances, only cars with even- or odd-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads, with violators facing fines. This partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion in the city. The high turnout and success of these restrictions demonstrate that limiting car usage can have a positive impact on air quality and public health.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of residents participate in a car-free day each year. Cars are completely banned on this day, with only buses and taxis permitted. The goal of this event is to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. The success of this program has led to the expansion of car-free days to other cities in Colombia. Municipal authorities from other countries have also come to Bogota to observe and learn from this revolutionary movement.

Limiting car usage has several benefits for the environment and society as a whole. The reduction in car ownership and driving has the potential to significantly decrease carbon emissions, making a positive impact on global climate change. Additionally, car-free communities can reduce congestion and improve air quality, leading to healthier and more sustainable cities. The shift towards alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, can also bring a sense of community and connectedness among residents.

While the cultural shift away from car dependency may have implications for the car industry, it presents significant opportunities for urban planning and the development of innovative transportation solutions. The trend of limiting car usage is not limited to developed countries; it is also observed in the developing world, where burgeoning middle-class populations are contributing to increased air pollution in cities. Governments and organizations around the world are starting to recognize the importance of limiting car usage and promoting sustainable transportation options. Through these efforts, we can create more livable, environmentally-friendly, and efficient cities for future generations.",1
"Dear Florida Senator, I understand that every 4 years on the first Tuesday of November, the United States undergoes a change in Presidency. This change should be decided in a properly manner by the people and citizens of the country. This explains the purpose of this letter, to abolish the Electoral College. I have this opinion because it is unfair to the people. Sometimes, the electors tend to provoke the system too. However, if there is a way to keep it, we can use it if there is a tie between the Presidency voting.

The best argument that I have towards this action is plain and simple: it's unfair! Voting is all about going to the poll and having the excitement of knowing that your vote can change the next 4 years of your life, including America's life. This should not include the other electors in the house or the people in office. This is a democracy country, therefore, we the people should decide who the President is. With the Electoral College in process, the citizens votes are not a 100% necessity. The Winner Take all voting should be established. It's just floating around because it's the first step in voting. The next step is the Electoral College where Congress makes the next decision. This is wrong because the people need to have the final say on the voting because we are effected the most.

Another important reason why the Electoral College needs to be voted out is because the electors in Congress tend to provoke the voting. According to What is the electoral College, you are actually choosing your candidate's electors, not the actual president. Now your trust is in the candidates hands. At this point in time, you probably think its safe right? That those people know what there doing, but chances are that they dont. There goes many other things to stress about! At one point, the candidates did not even vote for the ""correct"" President which is a stab in the back to the voters. This is why there are trust issues with the voting.

Besides all the negativity that you've been hearing throughout this letter, there is a possibility that we can compromise. First, all the people that want to vote will vote, but the Electoral College will only be needed if there is a tie between the people to Presidency vote. If not, then the people decide. Without the electoral College present, the smaller states have the same equality and strength as the larger states as Source 3: In Defense of the electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president says. That source clearly implies that voters tend to pay too much attention to the campaign but everyone including the people in Congress see it, so what really makes the difference in voting? Without the electoral College, voting would not be so indecisive.

To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent years, and for good reason. With the negative impact that car emissions have on the environment and the health hazards associated with increased air pollution, it is important to consider the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars. Several articles highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal and ""The End of Car Culture,"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles provide evidence to support the advantages of reducing car usage, such as improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it is stated that automobiles are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions and how a decrease in driving can contribute to achieving these goals. By driving less and finding alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" discusses an experimental new district in Germany called Vauban, where street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited. This community promotes a car-free lifestyle by providing accessible public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our dependence on cars and create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities. The articles discussed provide evidence to support these advantages and highlight the importance of reducing our reliance on cars. By finding alternative modes of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and public transit, we can make significant progress towards a more sustainable future.",1
"The whole purpose of democracy is to create a government that reflects the desires, opinions, and attitudes of the people being governed, but how can this be achieved if the people aren't fairly represented during election time, presidential or otherwise? This is the problem with the Electoral College system it puts all of decisionmaking power in the hands of our electors, not the citizens themselves. To begin with, the electors selected by citizens are capable of defying the will of the people they were chosen to represent. Next, in the case of a tie, the opinions of millions of people would be overlooked. Finally, because the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on obtaining votes instead informing all voters about their intentions, only the influential ""swing"" states receive enough attention from candidates to make a wellinformed decision when voting. When it comes to something as serious as the fate of our country, citizens cannot put their faith in the such a corrupt system as the Electoral College.

First of all, the Electoral College system creates a window of opportunity for ""faithless"" electors to take advantage of the power given to them by society during the voting process. Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College.

Secondly, if a tie were to occur, the opinions of countless citizens would be ignored. In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of representatives can hardly be expected to represent the will of the people.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. By reducing the dependence on cars, people can experience a variety of benefits such as improved health, reduced pollution, and more efficient transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on individual health. When people rely less on cars and instead use alternative transportation methods such as walking or cycling, they are more likely to engage in physical activity. Regular physical activity has been linked to numerous health benefits, including a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease. In addition, walking and cycling provide an opportunity for people to enjoy the outdoors and connect with their surroundings, improving their overall well-being.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in pollution. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and help combat climate change. In addition, cars emit other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can contribute to poor air quality and harm human health. By limiting car usage, communities can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for their residents.

Limiting car usage can also lead to more efficient transportation options and improved accessibility. When fewer cars are on the road, congestion is reduced and traffic flows more smoothly. This can result in shorter commute times and less frustration for drivers. In addition, limiting car usage can encourage the development of alternative transportation infrastructure, such as public transit systems and cycling lanes. These options can provide more accessible and affordable transportation choices for individuals who do not own cars or prefer not to drive. This can improve overall mobility and make communities more inclusive.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. Cars require significant financial investment, including the purchase price, maintenance costs, and fuel expenses. By reducing car ownership and usage, individuals can save money and allocate their resources to other needs or desires. Additionally, communities can save on infrastructure costs by prioritizing alternative transportation options. Building and maintaining roads, parking lots, and other car-centric infrastructure can be expensive and require extensive land use. By shifting focus to public transit and other non-car modes of transportation, communities can save money and use the land more efficiently.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From improved health and reduced pollution to more efficient transportation options and economic benefits, reducing dependence on cars can create positive change for individuals and communities. By embracing alternative transportation methods and promoting smart planning, communities can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in various parts of the world. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have made the bold decision to give up their cars, resulting in a peaceful and happier community. This experimental district has banned street parking, driveways, and home garages, allowing only two places for car parking. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent actually sold a car to move to this car-free community. The impact of this decision is evident as the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children can be heard on the streets of Vauban, drowning out the occasional sound of a distant motor (Rosenthal, 2009).

This trend of limiting car usage is not limited to Germany. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced after days of near-record pollution caused by car emissions. Motorists with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or face fines. As a result of this ban, congestion in the capital city dropped by 60 percent, and the smog that had rivaled Beijing eventually cleared (Duffer, 2014).

Cities all over the world are starting to realize that separating suburban life from car usage is a vital step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating pollution. Efforts are being made to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are being placed along main streets instead of distant highways, making them easily accessible by foot (Rosenthal, 2009).

The benefits of limiting car usage extend beyond environmental considerations. The car-dependent culture that has dominated many societies is slowly changing. Studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Even before the recession hit, there was a decrease in driving that is persisting now that the economy is recovering. This change in behavior has important implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as well as for the car industry itself (Rosenthal, 2013).

In addition to reducing pollution and promoting sustainability, limiting car usage can also improve quality of life. A car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, with millions of people hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work. This resulted in an eerily traffic-free city, promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog. The event has been so successful that it has spread to other Colombian cities and countries around the world. Bogota has also seen improvements in its infrastructure, with the construction of miles of bicycle paths and the development of parks and sports centers (Selsky, 2002).

These examples highlight the advantages of limiting car usage. By creating car-free communities, implementing driving bans, and promoting alternative transportation, cities can reduce pollution, improve quality of life, and create a more sustainable future for their citizens. It is evident that the traditional car-centered culture needs to change in order to address environmental concerns and improve the overall well-being of society.",1

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While there has been much debate around this topic, I believe that the Electoral College provides many benefits that outweigh the arguments for a direct popular vote.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As demonstrated in the 2012 election, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This translates to a clear victory and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election's outcome. With a winner-take-all system in most states, a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This stability and predictability are vital in ensuring the smooth functioning of our democracy.

Additionally, the Electoral College guarantees that the president represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. No single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, thereby encouraging candidates to appeal to voters from all parts of the country. This requirement ensures that our president has trans-regional appeal and considers the interests of all Americans. Without the Electoral College, there is a risk of candidates focusing solely on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the needs and concerns of those from rural or less populated regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College system gives greater weight to swing states. This incentivizes candidates to campaign extensively in these states, resulting in a more engaged and informed voter population. Voters in swing states become pivotal in deciding the outcome, making their votes more influential. This approach encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing state voters and hear their opinions, ultimately leading to a more representative government.

The Electoral College also balances power between states of varying sizes. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate is an issue, the Electoral College mitigates this by providing greater attention to large states. A candidate winning by a significant margin in a large state, such as Florida, would receive more electoral votes compared to a narrow victory in a smaller state like Wyoming. This ensures that candidates are not only focused on highly populated areas but also reach out to voters in states of all sizes.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College produces a clear winner without the need for a complicated run-off process. This saves time, resources, and potential confusion that could arise from multiple rounds of voting or a protracted election season.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who believe their vote does not count in states dominated by one party, the fact remains that millions of Americans vote in each presidential election. Voters are motivated to express their political preferences rather than solely believing their vote will swing the entire election. In this regard, the Electoral College does not detract from civic engagement.

In conclusion, the arguments presented in favor of the Electoral College system demonstrate its merits and underscore why it should be maintained. The certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, attention to large states, and avoidance of run-off elections are all invaluable aspects that contribute to a robust and effective democratic process. I urge you to consider these points when evaluating any proposals to change our current system.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will take into account the diverse perspectives that exist and make a decision that upholds the principles and values upon which our great nation was founded.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"As we face the consequences of climate change and strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the idea of limiting car usage has gained traction in various parts of the world. From Vauban, Germany, to Paris, France, to Bogota, Colombia, communities are experimenting with car-free living and experiencing the advantages that come with it. By adopting smart planning principles and promoting alternative modes of transportation, these communities are not only reducing their impact on the environment but also improving quality of life.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, which could be significantly reduced if more communities follow the car-free model. Similarly, in the United States, transportation is the second largest source of emissions, making it essential to find ways to limit car usage.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve quality of life in communities. In Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is restricted and streets are car-free, residents have reported feeling less stressed and happier overall. Without the constant noise and pollution from cars, the streets are filled with the sounds of bicycles and the chatter of children. This creates a more peaceful and pleasant living environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage allows for the creation of more compact and accessible communities. By placing stores and services within walking distance, communities are not only reducing the reliance on cars but also promoting a healthier lifestyle. In Bogota, Colombia, the car-free day initiative has led to the construction of bicycle paths and the improvement of sidewalks, making it easier for people to walk or bike to their destinations. This promotes physical activity and reduces air pollution at the same time.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for economic benefits. In Paris, France, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion. While delivery companies complained about lost revenue, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers. This shows that alternative modes of transportation can be encouraged while still supporting certain industries.

Although these examples are encouraging, it is important to acknowledge that a cultural shift is necessary to fully embrace car-free living. In the United States, for example, studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior, combined with changes in technology and urban planning, has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for the environment and for quality of life. The examples mentioned in the passages demonstrate that car-free living is not only possible but also beneficial for individuals and communities. By adopting smart planning principles and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can reduce our impact on the environment, improve the livability of our communities, and create a sustainable future.",1
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has been a growing trend in cities around the world, with numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative transportation methods. By reducing car usage, cities can address issues like greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and pollution. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from various sources.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and using alternative modes of transport, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, cities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. Rosenthal mentions that automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, leading to increased traffic on roads. By adopting a ""smart planning"" approach and creating more compact communities with better accessibility to public transportation, cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads and improve traffic flow. For example, Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen 57 percent of its residents sell their cars and 70 percent of families not owning cars, resulting in less traffic and a more peaceful and sustainable living environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality and public health. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, it is mentioned that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. Cold nights and warm days caused a layer of warmer air to trap car emissions, leading to smog and poor air quality. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative transportation methods, cities can reduce air pollution, decrease respiratory problems, and improve overall public health.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more vibrant and livable communities. Andrew Selsky highlights in his article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" that car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, have resulted in empty streets and improved quality of life. With fewer cars on the roads, people have more opportunities to walk, bike, and interact with others. This shift in transportation culture can lead to the creation of pedestrian-friendly spaces, better urban design, and the promotion of community interaction.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and creating more vibrant communities, cities can become more sustainable and livable. While there are challenges and adjustments associated with limiting car usage, it is clear that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. As the trend towards reducing car reliance continues to grow, more cities around the world can embrace smart planning and develop into thriving, environmentally-friendly communities.",1
"Limiting car usage has many advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in various experiments and initiatives around the world that have shown positive results.

One example is the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars. With only two places to park, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. The residents of Vauban have reported feeling happier and less stressed without cars. This is echoed by studies that have shown a decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States. Researchers believe this decrease in driving is due to a fundamental shift in American behavior.

Reducing car usage has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can be as high as 50. By limiting car usage, we can contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. 

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help ease traffic congestion and improve air quality. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during a period of intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. This demonstrates how reducing car usage can have an immediate and positive impact on air quality and overall traffic flow. Bogota, Colombia, also implemented a car-free day, which not only reduced smog but also promoted alternative transportation and reduced traffic jams.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health. By promoting alternative forms of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This can lead to improved fitness levels, reduced obesity rates, and overall better health outcomes.

Moreover, limiting car usage can contribute to the revitalization of urban areas. By creating pedestrian-friendly environments and placing stores within walking distance, cities can become more vibrant and accessible to everyone. This has been seen in cities like Bogota, where the construction of bicycle paths and the implementation of car-free days have led to the growth of parks, sports centers, and new commercial districts.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, improve air quality, promote public health, and revitalize urban areas. The various experiments and initiatives around the world have shown that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for individuals but also for society as a whole. It is important for us to embrace this idea and support policies and initiatives that encourage alternative forms of transportation.",1

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained. Although there are valid counterarguments for changing to a popular vote, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that every region is represented, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and prevents run-off elections.

One of the key reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes in most states, where even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory, reduces the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which encourages candidates to campaign across the country and appeal to diverse regions. This prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that every region feels represented.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. In a close election, candidates concentrate their attention on the states that are most likely to determine the outcome. This leads to increased voter attention and engagement in those states, as voters feel that their votes will have a significant impact on the election. The thoughtful and informed voters in swing states should be the ones to decide the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political weight of large states. Due to the malapportionment of the Senate, large states have less influence in the political process. The Electoral College provides a platform for presidential candidates to pay attention to larger states, as winning a large state garners more electoral votes compared to winning a small state. This ensures that the concerns and interests of residents in large states are not disregarded.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. With the Electoral College, a candidate who wins a majority in the Electoral College becomes the clear winner, regardless of their plurality in the popular vote. This eliminates the possibility of prolonged election procedures and complications that would arise from run-off elections.

While it can be argued that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the overall impact is minimal. The turnout in presidential elections is already high, with about half of the eligible American population voting. Voters participate to express their political preferences rather than in hopes of swinging a national election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be maintained as it provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for every region, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, gives weight to larger states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote, the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh those arguments. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a topic of interest in recent years, with many countries and cities implementing measures to reduce the number of cars on the road. This movement towards smart planning and reducing greenhouse gas emissions has numerous advantages that benefit both individuals and the environment.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent (Rosenthal 5). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as public transportation, walking, and cycling, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In cities like Paris, smog caused by car emissions has become a major problem. To tackle this issue, the city enforced a partial driving ban, which resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality (Duffer 14). Similar measures have been implemented in other cities, including Bogota, where a car-free day was organized to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Selsky 21). By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.

Aside from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage also has positive social and economic impacts. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. This has resulted in less congestion, quieter streets, and a greater sense of community (Rosenthal 3). In addition, limiting car usage can lead to a more compact and accessible urban environment. Instead of relying on cars to reach stores and malls along distant highways, smart planning focuses on placing stores within walking distance or along main streets (Rosenthal 6). This not only promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle but also boosts local businesses and reduces the need for large parking spaces.

While there may be concerns about the inconvenience of limiting car usage, there are many alternative forms of transportation available. Public transportation systems can be expanded and improved to provide efficient and affordable options for commuting. Walking and cycling infrastructure can be developed to make these modes of transportation safer and more accessible. Car-sharing and ride-sharing services can also provide convenient alternatives for those who need occasional access to a car.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that benefit individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible urban environments, we can create a sustainable and healthier future for all. It is time to embrace smart planning, explore alternative forms of transportation, and reduce our reliance on cars.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method for electing the President of the United States, and I urge you to consider the importance of maintaining this system in our democratic process. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a popular vote, serves as a vital safeguard for our nation's diverse interests.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome it provides. Unlike a popular vote, where disputes over the validity of votes can arise and potentially delay the election result, the Electoral College ensures that the winner's share of electoral votes usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and allows for a smoother transition of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the notion of having a president who represents the interests of all Americans. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign across the nation and consider the concerns and needs of voters from different regions. With the winner-take-all method, swing states become crucial in determining the election outcome. This means that these states receive more attention and resources from candidates, resulting in more informed and engaged voters.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives weight to large states and ensures that their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states. The apportionment of electors based on the number of representatives in the House and Senate means that large states have more influence in the electoral process. This balance is especially important as it prevents the marginalization of large states due to the constitutional apportionment of the Senate. By maintaining this balance, the Electoral College system provides adequate representation for citizens in both small and large states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system eliminates the need for runoff elections, which can be time-consuming, costly, and complex. Runoff elections often occur when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, leading to prolonged uncertainty and potential divisiveness. The Electoral College, on the other hand, nearly always produces a clear winner, preventing the need for an additional round of voting.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as concerns over fairness and voter turnout, it is essential to emphasize the multiple benefits provided by this system. As was evident in the 2012 election, the Electoral College encourages engagement from thoughtful voters in swing states, promotes representation for large states, and ensures a decisive outcome without the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system continues to serve as a fundamental pillar of our democratic process. It encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, protects the interests of all Americans, and provides certainty in the election outcome. It is my sincere hope that you will take these arguments into consideration and support the continued use of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your dedication to serving our great state.

Sincerely,

"Dear State Senator, It has recently come to my attention as I study our states voting system, that we as Americans do not have enough word in who we have as our leader. In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our constitution it states all men are created equal, when in all reality we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do. Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it allows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. It also gives less say to the smaller states making the people there feel there vote doesnt count, allowing them to vote for any party. If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president.

The first reason i feel we should overthrow the Electoral College is because it is discriminating states votes based on there sizes. In the article,""Does the Electoral College Work"", it states that because of the different sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.

Another reason i feel we should favor the popular voting system is because this would show that the soon to be presidents should vist all of there voters rather then the ones they know they will probably win. ""Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" What the author is saying here is the candidates dont give equal chances to the states to here what they,the candidates, have to say. For example if a democrate is going to states he would most likley avoid the ones full of republicans because he feels he has no chance and does not spend the money. But, if we get majority votes this will allow every indvividual to vote rather a group of republicans. Not only does this allow a better chance of winning for that democrate it allows the voters to feel like they can change there minds because they have a say. This will contribute to the conidates because they can now get there point across to more, rather then to select little groups.

The final reason we should get rid of this system is because at this point in time we are not even voting for our presidents we are voting for people who vote for us. What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for voting your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.

As we learn more about this topic we realize how rediculious this situation is. Obviously, going with popular vote is the best solution because we will finally be what everyone has been trying to do for decades, be equal. Sir, i hope you understand my rgument and really take into concideration what i have said.",0
"Do you think that the Electoral College prosses is practical? Do you think that it is okay for someone else to vote for us? Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voting and electing a president. Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process, it it outdated and not accurate, also the electors have proven to be untrustworthy in the past.

Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a candidate wants to win presidency, heshe has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors. Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidential election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes. Some people argue that the Electoral College is trustworthy, but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before?

Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it. Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any sense to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win! Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.

Don't you think that it is great to live in a free county where the citizens make the rules, and what is in the best interest of the people is what is taken into consideration more than what the government wants? Well, the Electoral College isn't what ""we the people"" want. We want to be able to choose who we elect, not another group of people. Some may argue that the electoral congress is good because if two candidates get the same amount of popular votes, the Electoral Congress acts as a tie breaker, but I'm sure that we can find a better way to break the tie than having untrustworthy people decide the fate of our homeland.

This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.",0
"We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corrupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important.

The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that ""under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president"". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said ""they can be anyone not holding public office"" and ""electors could always defy the will of the people"". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors"". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate.

The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a ""winnertakeall"" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the ""winnertakeall"" system ""awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". I agree with plumer, the electoral College needs to go.

Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the ""five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". Posner said the first reason was ""certainty of outcome"". The second reason is ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"". the third and fourth reason is ""swing states"" and ""big states"". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can ""avoid runoff elections"". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness?

We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a ""winnertakeall"" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said ""Abolish the Electoral College!"".",0
"There have been many discussions whether or not having an electorsal college as the system to decide the president is alright. Many people say this system is corrupted and that it must be thrown out to think of a new better government system, while many other people disagree and state that ""yes"", this system works perfectly well and that we should keep it this way for many years. Of course, most of the population of the country simply believe this system is best and we should keep it. This may be because certainty of the outcome, and because the system is made out well. Of course, there is also a downside to this such as when a person goes to vote, their not necessarily voting for whom they believe to be voting for.

To begin with, having the electorsal college is great because of the fact that there is certainty of the outcome. As said in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, there is absolute certainty of the person you're voting for is going to win or lose. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electorsal vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney. Useing this as an example explains that the electorsal college, to win it, you must need the majority votes.

Furthermore, the system it self is made out really well. As said in source 1, the electorsal college process consists of the selection of the electorss which consists of 538 and only takes 270 electorsal votes to elect a president. During this meeting they vote for who they want as president and vice president. Also, your state's entitled allotment of electorss equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. In a way you could say that, the electorsal college is like a game, and many people just want it gone because they aren't good at it, or just don't understand it.

Of course there is always a downside to everything. This flaw is that, when you're voting, you're not voting for who you believe you are voting for. As said in source 2, when you vote for your president, the vote doesn't go to the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect the president. This may not sound so bad, but with something such as this, there could easily be some corruption in that and could change the outcome of the election. But even with this said, it's an unlikable chance. when you vote, the electors you voted for is most likely going to be an electors which will vote for your president. So no worries.

In conclusion, letting the electorsal college stay is a good idea. It is a well thought out system, and the certainty of which president will be elected is completely accurate which doesnt make it a big guessing game. Don't pay attention to those conspiricies of the electorsal college, that we have a great system.",0
"You and I both know very well that we love to breath fresh air. Going out into the forest and taking a big breath of what is called ""fresh air."" Why cant we get that in an everyday life? I'll tell you why, because of polution. Cars are a ginormous part of polution, so what if we drove less?

In Vauban, Germany they have given up cars almost completely. The streets in Vauban are ""car free."" If you want a car, you have to park it at a local park garage for 40,000 dollars added onto your house. That isnt even worth paying for. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She lives in this town so she knows how it is. Giving up a car can reduce stress! Boy do some people need to give up cars.

America's obeisity count is getting higher and higher by the month. What if we gave up cars? people would have to walk everywhere! That's a good way to get exercise. In passage 1 it says ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Stores are helping people out so they can walk to get what they need instead of driving.

It will be so much less expensive in everyday life if you dont have a car. You won't have to pay for gas, you won't have to pay for car insurance and you won't have to pay for mantanence! You also will not have to pay something crazy like ""40,000, along with a home."" If I had to pay that much more money to keep up with a car, I would give it up in an instant. I barely have enough money to support the car alone, there is no way i can pay an extra 40,000 dollars!

Not having a car seems easier and healthier to me! You can walk more, so you get you exercise in everyday. You dont have to spend money on the car, no gas, no insurance and no mantanance! That means you can spend it on important stuff, perhaps on schooling! You also dont have as much stress on your hands. You dont have to worry about stopped traffic because you can just walk, ride a bike, or jog to where ever you have a desire to go. I say we get rid of cars all together in the United States of America.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the road, communities can contribute to reducing these emissions and combatting climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog highlights how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can experience cleaner and healthier air. This can have both immediate and long-term benefits for public health, as well as reduce the occurrence of respiratory problems and other health issues related to pollution.

In addition, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, demonstrates how removing cars from the streets can result in less traffic and more efficient transportation. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and public transit, communities can reduce the number of cars on the road and improve overall traffic flow.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more sustainable and compact communities. The passage on the German suburb of Vauban illustrates how designing communities to be less car-dependent can create a more environmentally friendly and livable environment. By placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, communities can become more accessible and promote a sense of community engagement.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions how car ownership in Vauban is limited, with 70% of families not owning cars. This can result in cost savings for individuals who no longer have to bear the expenses associated with car ownership, such as gas, maintenance, and parking. Additionally, communities can free up space previously allocated to parking lots and garages, which can be repurposed for other uses such as parks or community spaces.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, alleviation of traffic congestion, creation of more sustainable communities, and economic benefits. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and designing communities with less dependence on cars, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"To whom it may concern, I have recently been enlightened on what Electoral College is all about. According to ""What Is the Electoral college?"" Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. As quoted also from ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

First of all, the Electoral College should be kept because no, one region has the ability to elect a president. A certain region can gather all it's people to favorite one of the candidates, but it still won't be enough to reach a biased conclusion in the final election. The candidates also cannot count on one of their favorite states or even regions for them to win because, with only regional or state appeal, it will become unlikely for them to be a successful president.

In addition, having The Electoral College will ensure that the larger states can't overrule the smaller state based on population. It balances the weight of more populated states to smaller populated states. This is good because now, the smaller populated states will feel that they actually have power in the Election process instead of feeling left out due to a larger population. This is also significant because now the candidates won't aim their campaigning only towards the higher populated states. They will go all around the country trying to emphasize their importance in winning the campaign.

In conclusion, the obvious solution here is to keep using the Electoral College process. It not only ensures that one state or region does not have enough votes alone to sway the election, it allows the smaller populated states to have just as big of a say in the election as the larger states. The procedure of using The Electoral college has been around for quite a while now and it's clear why. It is the most beneficial way of ensuring that the right candidate will get into office, based off of the right terms.",0

Subject: A Case for the Electoral College

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and argue against the proposed change to electing the President of the United States through a popular vote. The Electoral College, though imperfect, holds intrinsic value and serves essential purposes that outweigh the arguments against it.

One of the main reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of a presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner's share of electoral votes consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system allows for a clear victory, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. The Electoral College's winner-take-all principle also ensures that voters from all states have a voice, preventing candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas or regions where their support is concentrated.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters trans-regional appeal in presidential candidates. In a nation as diverse as ours, it is important for the President to represent and address the concerns of all regions. By requiring candidates to appeal to a broad range of states, the Electoral College promotes the selection of individuals who are better equipped to address the needs of the entire nation. If the election were purely based on a popular vote, candidates would be incentivized to concentrate their efforts on densely populated areas or states that align closely with their party's ideologies. This potential exclusivity undermines the principles of representation and governance that our democracy stands for.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. By allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates are encouraged to campaign in states with unpredictable outcomes. This system makes these states the battlegrounds of the election, leading to increased voter engagement, attentiveness, and participation. Swing states serve as representative microcosms of the entire nation, as they attract the most diverse range of voters and therefore provide candidates with a deeper understanding of the electorate's concerns.

The Electoral College also ensures that large states are given a proportionate amount of attention during presidential campaigns. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may disadvantage them in other areas of governance, the Electoral College serves to restore balance by granting these states more electoral votes. Candidates recognize the importance of appealing to states with larger populations, as winning their support can significantly impact the overall outcome of the election. This ensures that the concerns and interests of large states are not overshadowed or disregarded.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. With the current system, a candidate must secure a majority of electoral votes, preventing situations where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the complexity and potential disruptions that would arise from run-off elections, keeping the presidential election process more streamlined and decisive.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to emphasize that voters participate in elections not solely to influence the outcome, but also to exercise their democratic right and express their political preferences. The Electoral College does not diminish the importance of individual votes, as they continue to play a fundamental role in shaping political preferences and mandates.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite its imperfections, serves crucial purposes that ensure the balance, representation, and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures a clear outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes voter engagement in swing states, gives attention to large states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I respectfully urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College and retain it as the method for electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make informed decisions that best serve our democracy and the interests of all citizens. If you would like any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"Recently, there have been and more people walking, riding bikei, and carpooling with friendi to get to the placei they need to be. Becauie of the fact that people are doing thii, the amout of imog in the air hai reduced, people are leii itreiied, and the environment will be a healthier place and create healthier livei. If thii continuei to happen and more people become involved, it will make live better for everyone and we will live on a much healthier planet. Plui, the price of gai will go down, and who doein't want that? Theie ideai that Parii, France and Bogota, Colombia created to have a carfree dayi are brilliant and extremely helpful to all.

In Parii, France, a ihort driving ban occurred due to maiiive air pollution. For two dayi, certain people were not allowed to drive on the roadi to help reduce the about of imog. On Monday, only driveri who owned a vehicle with an oddnumbered licenie plate were allowed on the roadi and on Tueiday, thoie rulei were iwitched. Anyone who did not obey thii rule wai fined 22 euroi 31. Thii wai a brilliant plan becauie the amountt of imog in Parii wai reduced by 60% after five coniecutive dayi of it being quite itrong. In France, dieiel fuel makei up about 67% of automobilei, io thii ii what wai blamed. The 67% ii a high percent compared to the reit of Weitern Europe which averagei at about 53.3%. Reuteri, which ii an international newi agency that hai iti main headquarteri in london, found that Parii hai an unuiually large amount of imog compared to the reit of the European capitali. While Bruiieli had 114 microgrami of particulate matter PM and london had 79.7, Parii had the abiurd number of 147. In Bogota, Columbia, their annual carfree day wai created to decreaie the imog and to promote other traniportation optioni. The violatori of thii day had to pay a 25 fine. A buiineiiman in Bogota reipondi with hii opinion on thii day with, ""It'i a good opportunity to take away itreii and lower air pollution."" About 57% of familiei who currently live in Vauban, Germany iold their car to move there. Currently about 70% of familiei there don't even own a car. According to Heidrum Walter who ii a mother of two children ai well ai a media trainer, ihe ii much happier without a car becauie when ihe had one, ihe alwayi uied to be io tenie. Being outdoori ii io refreihing, io why not do it more often? For the pait two decadei, there have been efforti to make citiei better for walking and other alternative traniportation ai oppoied to cari. Vauban ii known ai benig the ""moit advanced experiment in lowcar iuburban life""Eliiabeth Roienthal. There ii where the movement called ""imart planning"" wai created. About 5,500 people live within one rectangular iquare mile, and thii ii in attempt to make the iuburbi ""more compact"" and eaiier to uie public and alternative traniportation. Becauie of thii, there ii alio leii parking around the city and itorei are placed on a main itreet initead of iniide a mall that could be milei and milei away from reiidential areai. Alio, parki and iporti centeri are uied more frequently and thoie uneven iidewalki were replaced with imooth onei for walking, riding a bike, etc. Now there ii no more road rage and yelling at thoie driveri who can't hear you from two lanei away.

The amountt of people between the agei of 1639 have become leii intereited in getting their licenie, or it juit iin't a priority for them. The older generationi nowadayi have been know to kee their liceniei and continue heir driving. If the decreaie of driver'i liceniei continuei, there will be multiple benefiti for the environment and for carbon emiiiioni. Automobile traniportation ii the iecond greateit iource of America'i carbon emmiiioni. The only factor that ii ahead of thii ii power planti. Moit people who live in the iuburbi have a car, becuaie they believe that thii ii the only way to get around. There are, in fact, loti of other optioni, and thii ii only harming our environment becauie the cari that moit people own are held accountable for 12% of greenhouie gai emiiiioni in Europe. In the United Statei, however. it ii about four timei worie. In the areai of the United Statei where there are a high number of cari, they are reiponiible for 50% of greenhouie gai emiiiioni. If theie percentagei can be reduced by uiing other veriioni of traniprtation beiidei cari, our world will be a much healthier place and it will live to be a lot longer.

The United Statei ihould definetely itart having an annual carfree day not only to reduce pollution, but to promote exeriice and the outdoori. How fantaitic would it be to iee more and more people riding their bikei to a park or to a friend'i houie? If you need to get iomewhere, you might ai well enjoy your ride by getting iome freih air and iome exeriice. A reduced amountt of time would be ipend on the roadi becauie there ii leii traffic, and that cauiei leii accidenti and people will feel much iafer.",0
"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME, As you are well aware, elections in the United States are of extreme importance. Therefore, it is vital to have the best system possible when electing officials. Maintaining the current system of Electoral College would be a fatal mistake to our country. We must elect candidates by popular vote alone.

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Pulumer, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winnertake all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Americans who are voting the the next president should have the right to hear what candidates have to say. They may be the only one in their state who is not a democrat, but shouln't their vote still be heard.

The article also states that, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where sate delegations vote on the president."" Shouldn't the American people get to decide who their president is?! We fought a war so that we would be able to govern ourselves. If the House of Representatives are allowed to choose our president, then why did why fight the war againg Great Britain? It isn't right.

In Defense of the Electoral college: Five Reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the President states that ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not be the winner of the popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely."" The opposition even admits that the President may not be who the nation wants as their leader. That should never happen.

As you see Senator, Electoral College must be abolished by any means necessary. To keep such an unjust system goes against the very principle the America was founded on. ""We the people..."" It was not ""We the government..."" or ""We the rulers..."". How can we claim to be a nation of liberty when the citizend are unable to determine who their president should be.",0
"""You can live in your car, but you can't drive your house."" This is a quote my teacher used to tell me as advise for the future. This was a way of saving money if you had to choose between paying rent or paying your car bills if you were in this situation. However, what he did not realize is its more useful to use less of your car.

Using less of your car improves the environment. Using less will reduce the pollution in the air that we breathe in. When we reduce our car use we reduce the amount of resources like fossil fuels and nonreuseable resources. When we use cars and create pollution we also create a smog, but when we stop using cars we can clear the smog. In paris, they banned car use for a certain amount of time and it reduced the amount of smog. In fact, in the article Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , it says ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" Another thing that reduces is your payments for your car. How can you pay for a car if you don't have one? The answer is you don't. Without a car you don't have to pay car payments or repair payments. You also don't have to worry about getting fines or looking for parking spaces. In the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it reads ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" If you are not already worried with you car payments, you would be worried about your children's safety. Accidents happen all the time from cars. And if you're not in an accident you could be the one with a car breakdown on your way to work. Now you may say, I need a car because I have to drive to work or drop my kids at school. Than here is a solution, in the article The End of Car Culture it says, ""Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" My teacher's quote about paying for cars is more useful than paying rent is incorrect. Using less of your car is an advantage to improving the environment, spending less money, and increasing safety in the world.",0
"Voting for a President is an extremely big deal and needs to be decided properly. People argue the subject that the Electoral College is unfair opposed to an election that is held by popular vote. However, I disagree. The Electoral College is a process in which the most popular vote gets decided on and goes to Congress for the approval. Voting for a president is a big deal, especially when the decision is sealed for four years. The Electoral College has had people question it due to its inncodent in 2000 but overall, it is the best voting option.

Many citizens believe that when they vote that is the final process, no other decisions need to be made, but they are wrong. When qualified citizens vote for a president they also help choose their state's electors. The Electoral College process includes the selection of electors, the vote between who should be President or Vice President and then sent to Congress. Many people argue that the process of the Electoral College is unfair because the electors decide, not the citizens. What people dont understand is the Electoral College are actually deciding for us and thats what makes voters ""iffy."" Under the Electoral College system, voters vote for the electors that actually decide who the president will be. Plumer, 10 The issue that gets faced to the voting citizens is they cant control whom their electors vote for. This can be an issue because of whats known as the disaster factor. Plumer, 11. The most known disaster factor was the big election crisis of 2000. The 2000 campaign was not held very properly, infact seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. People say that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational but in all actuality it is the best way to vote for who will become president. Bob Dole made the comment ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" but if we had just a popular vote, without Congress having a say in the decision, the process wouldnt be as organized.

In the year 2000 the Electoral College faced a big issue with the ""fairness"" of the voting process. At the time Al Gore and George W. Bush were running for president but Bush won receiving 271 electoral votes and Gore 266. Plumer, 1 This made citizens furious because they saw the Electoral College being unfair to voters. Despite that particular campaign, the Electoral College has not shown much faults. All in all the Electoral College process gets the decisons made faster and more efficenty opposed to if it was just by the overall most popular vote.

The argument of the Electoral College method of choosing their president and loosing voters is very popular. Voters knowning their vote will not have any effect, the less voters choose to participate and listen to the campaign. But in all actuality one voters vote will not swich or make the election any different, that is why we have the Electoral College. The Electors make the decison for us, taking the most popular votes and looking them over putting in their extra votes. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" Posner, 23. Despite the negative views on the Electoral College, it is actually the most organized ""fair"" voting process.",0
"Car usage has long been seen as a symbol of freedom and convenience, especially in suburban areas. However, there is a growing movement towards limiting car usage, and there are several advantages to this approach. By reducing car dependency, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. Examples from Vauban, France; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia, demonstrate the positive effects of limiting car usage.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions. In Europe, they account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent. By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. After the ban, congestion was reduced by 60 percent, and the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Similarly, Bogota implemented a car-free day, which resulted in streets devoid of traffic jams and a decrease in smog. These examples show that reducing car usage can have a positive impact on air pollution and public health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are banned from most streets, residents have found alternative ways to get around, such as cycling and using public transportation. As a result, the streets are quiet and safe, and there is no need to worry about parking spaces. This approach is being adopted in other parts of the world, as planners recognize the need for more compact and accessible suburbs with less space for parking. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and biking, we can alleviate traffic congestion and create more livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and reducing traffic congestion. Examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive effects of this approach. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walkability and public transit, we can create more sustainable and livable cities for the future. It is essential that we continue to promote and implement these strategies to address the environmental and social challenges posed by car dependency.",1
"CarFree Cities Humans almost feel the need to own a car almost as much as they feel the need to own a phone. The automobile industry has been a growing industry since World War 2. There are so many advantages to limiting car usage. Saving on gas and getting good exercise are just a few of the great advantages of limiting car usage.

Vauban, Germany understands that according to Source 1 which talks about how they have given up their cars! Not only is it saving them a ton of money on gas, car insurance, car payments, and fixing parts, it also gives them all great exercise. If everyone walks everywhere everyday the whole city will be fit in no time. Another advantage to the loss of cars, no car accidents. 180,000 people die a year due to car accidents. The death's in this city will be reduced drastically due to no cars. This no car movement is a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"".

Source 2 talks about how Paris has banned driving due to smog. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. The advantages of limiting car usage here is the you'd never have to worry about there being smog outside or snow etc. Limiting car usage, you wouldn't have to worry about the weather being so terrible that you can't drive in smog or heavy rain and have a car accident.

Bogota, Colombia joins the no car movement for what is known as ""CarFree Day"". Source 3 discusses the day without cars in Bogota, Colombia. It is an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It's seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to their city's mayor. Limiting car usage in this city could be great for a lot of reasons. One being they are the only LatinAmerican city to have covered 118 miles of bicycle paths. Their parks and sports centers are now blooming throughout the city. It's uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.

Source 4 talks about the End of Car Culture. Studies have shown that as the years go on, driving is becoming less and less popular which is sad for many automobile industries worldwide. In America, the partial cause of the decrease in car usage is the unemployment rate being so low, it's not like someone has to go to work. Gas is becoming to expensive, why would people even want to have cars if they can barely afford them? Riding a bicycle is beneficial for more money in your pocket and more healthiness for your body.",0
"The electoral college was a great attempt to give a reliable system of selecting the president, but it just does not work the way our founding fathers wanted it to. Many people throughout the country have brought this up as a major issue because they also agree. The other option that people would prefer to have would be selecting the president by the popular vote, which is the smarter path. This method is more democratic, it has a smaller chance of producing unreliable results, and it encourages voters to still vote in states where there is already a predominant political party.

The electoral college is not democratic. The method of selecting people for it is generally controlled by each candidate's political party, and their responsibilities vary based on the party's wants. The people who select the candidates for the electoral college are not part of the popular population they are part of a political party. Next, when people go to vote for the president, they are not voting for the president, but actually voting for a slate of electors that in their turn vote for the president. And to take this to the next step, as shown in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""Most states have a winnertakesall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If voters vote for the candidate that ends up losing, poof, all their votes are given to the other team. To atleast make this a little more fair, instead of voting for the president, voters should cast votes for the electoral college members that are choosing their president. That way, you can at least do research on the people whom you are really voting for and make the best decision possible.

The popular vote is the most reliable way to get results from the people. It is the most raw, unbreakable way of selecting the highest political figure of the country. On the other hand, the electoral college's slight stretches have the possibility of unreliable results. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"", it becomes known that ""...thanks to the quirks of the electoral college Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". It is still argued that the electoral members chosen are extremely trustworthy :""each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed"" from ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". However, even in the continuation of the fragment above, even Richard A. Posner ,the author, admits ""however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national vote."" The electoral college members are trusted to vote for whom they were voted for, but their job is to be a highly knowledgeable political expert and if they see the other president as a better choice, then it can become very unfair.

The electoral college discourages people to vote in countries where there is already a dominating party. For example, California is mostly a democratic country that usually casts a highly populated vote for the democratic party's electoral candidates. So why should republicans consider voting in this area? The government has always tried to push out that ""every vote counts"", but is this really the case? Another good point of this is explained by Bradford Plumer again in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" : ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races of 'swing' states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina..."" Swing states, as the're called, are the places where presidential candidates always hang around. They barely bother with the other states because they know they have already got or lost the vote in them...

Some laws were brilliantly passed, but had to eventually be deconstructed due to present implications. The electoral college is not democratic, doesn't produce reliale results, and discourages voters. It is time that we abolish this college just at we overturned the eighteenth amendment before.",0
"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democraticPlumerParagraph9.

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privileges. A poll of over 610 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be controversial though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the controversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. KennedyPlumerParagraph1011 There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronismPosnerParagraph15. If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.",0
"I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the electorsal College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electorss. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. electorss can defy the will of the people. The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president.

First, you have to vote for the electorss not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electorss vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong electors. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.

Then, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even see a campaign ad. Though they established electorsal college in the constitution Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorsal college.

Lastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electorss. If there is a tie between the electorss then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent's electorss. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?

The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorsal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electorss. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president. The electorsal college should be changed to the popular vote for the president, because the electorss can defy the will of the people.",0
"Cars are a basic need for people today we use them to go from point A to point B in the fastest way posible. But one must ask themselves ""do i really need the car?"", ""would i be better off without one?"", how do you tell people that what they have depended on for movement could be hurting them. I believe that cars should have a limited usage in cities because cars affect our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas, they cause smog to form around cities, and cause us to move through life at the fastest pace posible. A limited car usage would change the way we see the world its beauty, its adventersm, and we would be able to save the world from our destruction.

There is a community in Germany called Vauban where people have given up their cars. 70% of vaughn's families do not own cars, 57% sold their cars just to move to Vauban, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way,"" media trainer and mother of two Heidrun Walter says in the artical ""In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"". Also the artical states that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and responsible for up to 50% in the United States. Vauban houses up to 5,500 resident within a rectangular square mile, which makes it posibly the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life, stores are placed just a short walk away so that no car is needed.

Smog a thick layer of black fog that hurts your lungs and can even kill you. Paris had to ban driving due to smog , cars with even numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive one day and the following day cars with odd numbered license plates would not be allowed to drive. 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction to the fine. This statement from the artical ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" show that cars are responsible for a gas that can kill people, and that people dont respond well to being told what to do. In one week the ban was lifted because the smog had cleared enough but not all the way, just a week of limited car usage cleared the skys imagin what a year of it would do.

Cars have us going the fastest we can and people have started to live that way through life. In Bogota they have a day free of cars every years like its a holiday. People left their keys on the counter and insted hiked, biked, skated and took the bus. Even in the rain people didnt use their cars, "" The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,"" says Bogata Mayor Antanas Mockus. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says "" Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"". The quotes from the artical "" Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" show that with out cars people feel realeved of stress and are able to have a good time.

In conclusion limited car usage would help us presurve the world and create a enviroment that could help people aswell. Cars are one of the most used products in the world people might not want to give up their cars but eventually might have to. Smog and greenhouse gas are caused by car overuseage and hurt the enviroment and people. Limited car usage is posably the only answer to helping the world live longer aside from buying a hybrid car.",0
"Ever since cars were invented, they have widely been used as the primary source of transportation. They became so commonplace that their widespread use started to introduce negative impacts. As a result, some countries, or cities, have recently put in place programs or events to limit, or decrease, the amount of car usage in that area. There are many advantages to limiting car usage, including that not using cars is better for the environment and that it allows the city to improve itself.

In recent years, the environment has become a worldwide concern one of the advantages to limiting car usage is that it will positively impact the environment. Today, people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", she writes, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with evennumbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with oddnumbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with oddnumbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one.

Additionally, the limited use of cars opens many opportunities for cities to improve themselves by adding new features or improving upon old ones. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, ""It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the cityuneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"". These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay ""In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars"". She writes, ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs"". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.

There are many advantages to limiting car use. Not only does it improve the environment by removing smog and reducing greenhouse gas emission, but it also allows the area to improve itself by building new features. For this reason, limited car use should be seen as an overall positive idea.",0
"Not a day goes by that you don't see a car passing by on the street. Often, we don't think much of it and the effects it has. Throughout the world there are communities campaigning, trying to lower the usage of motor vehicles. The citizens in these communities are aware of all the cons that come with driving cars. There are plenty of benefits to not driving cars everyday such as, lower the amount of air pollution, being inclined and motivated to exercise often, and the money that this act can save.

The number of cars being purchased in America has been dwindling with each year that passes. If this pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This is due to the fact that transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just barely behind the power plants. At one point in Paris, France, there was an extreme case of congestion which provided the air with more than its fare share of smog. The city was told to momentarily stop the driving of motor vehicles. congestion went down 60 percent after five days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the world's most polluted cities. By driving a car less the environment benefits emmecely.

In Vauban, Germany it costs 40,000 to have a place to park your car along with your home. As a result from that about 70% of the families in Vauban don't even own a car, let alone drive one. Heidrum Walter notified people saying, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" She along with &0% of the citizens walk verdant streets and ride bicycles. As a result they are getting a measure of exercise more than they would be getting if the drove cars. When you excersise and sweat, your body releases endorphines which triggers a chemical in your body. The triggering of that chemical causes you to feel happier which is just what the people of Vauban are.

Some people are very well capable of purchasing a car but don't. Just that simple Non act saves them quite a handful of money. Now, sometimes things like driving a car are necessary, so I'm not saying NEVER drive your car. However, if in the cases where it isn't necessary you were to walk or ride a bike you would potentially be saving pockets of money because gas isn't being purchased as frequwntly as it would be otherwise. The reduced amount of car driving even benefits your bank account.

Motor vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, are not always necessary. Not utilizing them comes with plenty of benefits. It reduces the amount of smog and air pollution, it makes you healthier and potentially happier, and lastly it saves you money. Walk around a little. Go on a bike ride. Experience all the beneifts of leaving your car in the garage.",0
"Thinking of the past century ideas of driving cars and SUV's around is considered fairly overrated now a day's. operating moto vehicle in city scapes and rural areas can get so overwhelming the constant worry of oncoming traffic and pedestrians steering into your direction, dangerous pollution threatening to destroy the ecosystems & surrounding landscapes, not to mention expenses that are strung along with the cost driving a car. By eliminating or limiting the use of cars, these unnecessary issues would just simply....float away.

As we all know as a result of past generations: Global Warming is on the rise. This statement is especially true in the city of Paris, France...named to be the most polluted city in the world amoung tourist destinations in Europe. In a act to reduce these smog issues, ""On Monday motorist with evennumbred licence plates were ordred to leave their cars at home or suffera 22euro fine"" says Robert Duffer who wrote from the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" in the Chicago Tribune.

Ever since Paris officials had made this change in leglisation, pollution has gone down considerabley. Imagine driving through your city for example I live in Jacksonville Beach, and there is no more smog, traffic is reduced, and the air you breathe is actually cleaner than before. From putting certain restraints like the city of Paris did on commuting, you too could experience all the wonders of ""cutback driving"".

Moving onto another terrific viewpoint of limited car usage is a cut down on cost. Now how great does that sound, and in this expanding economy I'll be happy if gasoline prices drop below 2 dollars! On a serious note, the price tags of a car are extremely heavy now as they were say two decades ago. There are matanince issues, speeding tickets, parking meter tickets, if you have a flat tire then you call a tow truck which....

COST MONEY!

""New York's new bikesharing program and it's skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal from ""The End of Car Culture"". Now in modern cities like New York, Miami, or even Jacksonville, many city officials have made this ninche of transportation much easier on civilians. Providing local trollys & public busses to help cut the cost of transportation for their residences. As exemplary from Rosenthal, its makes you happy not to drive a car as often... and makes you wallet happy too!

Although many critics are skeptical to obtain and enforce this idea, in actuallity this would be a tremendous favor to all if they participated. Sure if you don't have a car to use for example on a Saturday, then it may seem like a bummer but in perspective it's actually not! Getting around your local area and exploring all it has to offeroutside the four doors of you ""gashogger"" is a beautiful way to go through your day! Just think of all the chaching you'll be saving with every footstep you take.

WEEEWOOWEEHWOO !!! This is the sound of a ambulance driving in your lane to get to a car crash that hapened because of wreckless driving. ""It's the inevidable that the 1% of the 99% of all drivers are going to be in some form of a auto vehicle accident by the time their 50"" says Brian Williams of NBC Nightly News. Can you imagine that happening to you, or has it already? Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" since making the change of onfoot commute and biking to distant locations. I live in a beautiful beach side town where almost everything is acessable by walking, biking, city bus, Beaches Trolly, or a surfboard! I myself have tried this and rode my bike up to Trader Joe's to get some ice cream. I can say I felt very stressfree by the whole experience. From simply switching to a nonautomatic or mechanical form of transportation I not only relived my tension of road rage. I also had gained great deal of happiness from being outdoors.

In my last few final statements about the pros from limiting the usage of a vehicle, is it's just better. I dont know what other methods are so EASY to follow to get the results you want to the problems and issues people struggle with. Worry about the enviorment? Try limiting you car driving to every other day. Want more money in your pockets insted of in your car? Take the transportation thats provided in your local area to get around you city in. Want to ease the stress that major highways and opperating a motor vehicle bring on? Get out and about by walking or biking to get from place to place.",0

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system for selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments for switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital safeguard to our democratic process and should be maintained. In this letter, I will address the concerns raised about the Electoral College and provide evidence to support its continued use.

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it is an outdated and non-democratic method of selecting the president. However, it is important to recognize that the Electoral College is a process, not a place, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register. It was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between Congress and popular vote by citizens. The process consists of the selection of electors, their voting, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress.

Proponents of a popular vote argue that it would ensure a more accurate representation of the will of the people. However, Judge Richard A. Posner argues that the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. In almost all states, electoral votes are awarded on a winner-take-all basis, which means even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the results, as seen in the 2000 election.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country is considered in the selection process. Posner emphasizes that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, preventing a situation where a candidate with only regional appeal wins the presidency. This promotes a more inclusive and representative outcome, as residents of all regions feel that their votes count and that the president is accountable to their interests.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states, highlighted by Posner, encourages candidates to campaign across the country and address the concerns of voters in competitive regions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and have received the most information, have a significant say in choosing the president. This approach promotes voter engagement and ensures a more informed electorate.

The Electoral College also balances the weight of large and small states. Judge Posner asserts that the electoral votes awarded to a state are not solely based on its population size but also on the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This prevents larger states from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates pay attention to the needs and issues of voters in smaller states.

Moreover, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This avoids the complication and uncertainty that can arise from run-off elections and guarantees a clear winner in the presidential race.

While some argue that a popular vote system would increase voter turnout, it is important to note that the current system does not prevent individuals from expressing a political preference. Even though their vote may not swing a national election, approximately half the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election. Voters participate in the process because they want to express their political preferences, not solely because they believe their vote could be decisive.

In summary, the Electoral College should be retained as it provides certainty of outcome, ensures regional representation, emphasizes the importance of swing states, balances the power of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. As evidenced by the arguments presented by Judge Posner, there are practical reasons for maintaining the Electoral College, regardless of political affiliation.

Thank you for considering my views on this important matter. I trust that you will make the right decision in supporting the retention of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Cars make it exceptionally easy to travel and move around. Auto use permits an individual to go to places they have not been before. In Europe, the countries that share the shingen space allow Europeans to move freely. To avoid pricy plane and train tickets, a lot of Europeans use their cars to go to an entirely different country and experience a variety of different cultures in a matter of hours. It is most certainly a privilege. Despite the many pros of having a car, the cons outweight them. Throughout this essay I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage.

In many countries and cities car usage has dropped. Some countries,it is purely accidental or due to economic reasons and in some cities and countries, this decline is intended. In a city called Vauban in Germany, citizens have given up their cars. In this city,street parking,driveways and garages are more often than not forbidden. This may seem strange to not have the privilege to own a car or a garage. But most of the residents have moved out from the city to live here. Heidrun Walter claims that she is much happier this way and before she was always tense.70% of the vaughn's family do not own a car, and 57% sold their cars to live in Vauban. This particular city is a mere example of a growing trend in Europe,the United States and various other country. The plan is to separate suburban life from auto usethis movement is called ""smart planning"".

In opposition, to these efforts, automobiles are usually an important factor to the suburbs where usually middleclass people live. This causes a huge impediment to current efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars. In Europe,passenger cars are the reason for the 12 percent of greenhousee gas emissions in the United states that number almost quadruples in size in some carintensive areas. The approach is to make suburbs more compact rather than having malls on the border on distant highways.

Due to smog and pollution to this global city's air, Paris enforced a driving ban to put an end to polution. 4,000 drivers were rightfully so fined that day. This issue had to be taken seriously for a greater cause. For example, for the smog levels to decrease and to purify the air in the cities and suburbs and to prevent pollution. Public transit was free for those five days that the ban was enforced. Congestion dropped 60% in Paris, ever since the driving ban. The smog rivaled Beijing, which is often known for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed because of a tax policy in favor of diesel fuel in France. More than half of vehicles run on diesel fuel in France.

In the Colombia's capital, Bogota, many colombians hiked,skated or took buses to work in spirit of their car free day. Personally I think this was an extravagent idea. It teaches people to not be so dependent on cars. This day significantly reduced traffic jams,smog and promoted transportation. This was a wonderful oppurtunity to lower stress and air pollution at the same time! Parks and sports bloomed that day, sidewalks that were unfinished and in poor conditions were replaced,the traffic decreased and restaurants blossemed. This car free day had an amazing impact on this community and the world.

Due to recents studies, Americans are driving less and buying few cars as the years go by. The miles driven have peaked in 2005 , but as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person dropped 9% , and was equal to the percentage in Janurary 1995. Scientist state that this decline is beneficial for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Although this might affect dearly the car industries. The rise of cellphones,internet and apps this permits a more flexible way of making commuting arangements,and the evolution of vans services.

A lot of people have been using public transportation and biking to get around. There has been a drop from 1639 year olds in getting their license. Getting license is not as big as of priority for those people. They revolve their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take busses and trains or carpool with friends.

To conclude, I strongly believe that limiting car use would benefit different aspects in peoples lives. But for people to give up using cars,the recontruction of suburban cities is a very important. I live in the suburbs and despite the houses around, you would need a car to go to the grocery store,restaurant and to have fun with your friends. Highways usually circle around suburban cities and that may cause congestion. To make car usage less of a priority for citizens, we would have to think of the greater cause and to restablish cities to not prohibit people from moving around. The decline in car use will improve the world for the generations to come.",0
"The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest country on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids runoff elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.

To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidates share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370. There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in cities and suburbs around the world. This shift in thinking is based on several advantages that come with reducing the reliance on cars. By limiting car usage, cities can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative transportation options, and enhance quality of life for residents.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly lower these emissions and contribute to environmental sustainability. This is especially important in the face of global climate change and the need to reduce our carbon footprint.

Additionally, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage mentions that smog and pollution levels in cities like Paris and Bogota have become a serious public health concern. By implementing car-free days or car-reduced policies, cities can decrease the amount of harmful emissions released into the air, leading to cleaner and healthier environments for residents. This not only benefits human health but also the health of the planet.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative transportation options. The passage set mentions the example of Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but parking is limited to a few designated areas. As a result, a majority of residents do not own cars and rely on bicycles, public transportation, walking, or car-sharing services. This kind of shift helps to reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and enhance overall accessibility for everyone, including those without access to cars.

An additional advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for residents. The passage set discusses how residents of Vauban in Germany have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up car ownership. With fewer cars on the road, neighborhoods become quieter, streets become safer for pedestrians and cyclists, and communities become more vibrant and connected. This creates a more livable and people-friendly environment, where residents can enjoy walking or biking to nearby amenities and interacting with their neighbors.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in cities and suburbs has several advantages that should be considered by citizens and policymakers alike. It can lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative transportation options, and enhance quality of life for residents. As we face the challenges of climate change and strive for more sustainable and livable communities, limiting car usage is an important step in the right direction.",1
"In today's growing world to many it may seem as if living without a car would be impossible. Our ever evolving lifestyles and cultures though may prove otherwise. Across the globe it is becoming more likely for people to leave their car at home, and walk opposed to driving a short commit. The benefits of this decision are incredibly impactful on the environment, improving human health and safety, as well as on our, the people's bank accounts. Becoming a society nonrelient on cars will prove not to be easy, but justifiable when those three points are taken into account.

The effect that cars have on the environment is no suprise to most. If you turn on most news channels, global warming is talked about by the hour. Thus proving drastic measures need to be taken to secure our planet's future. What better way of doing so then by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere. Source one line five states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" The article goes on to state in line seven our lives being centered around the use of cars will have to change. Our planet needs it's inhibitors to treat it with the same respect people do to the dignified, and a car free world is one way to do so.

By decreasing the number of people using cars as their mode of transportation good health and safety will soon be boosted across the globe. The effect of walking instead of drving will decrease obesity and increase positive moods. According to source one line 3 Heidrun Walter believes she is much happier and less tense without a car. If she a working women and mother of two can live without a car I find many other people could find ways to also. Limiting the use of cars would not only improve health but safety. By limiting cars you limit the amount of possible accidents. Whether an accident results from carelessness, accident, or intoxication there is no arguing the fact they take many innocent lives daily. By reducing the amount of car usage this will no longer be a major factor in the premature deaths of people. According to all four sources the idea of leaving cars parked in the garage at home, or choosing to live a car free lifestyle is catching on now more than ever. Personally I hope we soon have healthier, safer pedestrians.

In today's economy money is tight. People looking to save a dollar will justify almost all reasoning to do so. Throughout the world many countries have decided to become less relient on cars. By making cities more compact people are finding it very possible to live a life without cars. Imagine cutting the price of not only a car, but car insurance and gas out of your life. I can promise you your wallet would thank you. Source four line 35 states ""We are witnessing a long term culture shift."" The internet has made it possible to connect with friends and family without meeting face to face and because of this the use of cars is rapidly declining. Source four also states many of America's youth are declining the possiblity to be licesnced and drive. Suprisingly enough Mr. Sivak, a socialogist's children do not drive their ages being in the early twenties. This is yet more proof of our ever evolving lifestyles.

Fellow citizens, at times our lives can deal us many unexpected difficulties that make living in this day and age problematic. Cutting out the use of cars however would not be one of them. Deciding against the use of cars would impactful the environment, improve human health and safety, and our bank accounts from draining. All four sources prove the possiblity of a car free society throughout the entire world. So my question to you is why not stop using cars now? The world and your future self will surely thank you.",0

Subject: Favoring the Preservation of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While there are those who argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several benefits that should be considered before any changes are made.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As Judge Richard Posner points out in his article, ""Certainty of Outcome,"" the winner-take-all system in each state ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, as the outcome is more definitive. Furthermore, the Electoral College system makes it highly unlikely for a nationwide electoral tie to occur, as the even number of total votes increases the chances of a clear victor.

Another compelling argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president is everyone's president. In his article, Judge Posner highlights that no single region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates must appeal to a wide range of regions and demographics in order to secure victory. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College promotes a sense of national representation and prevents candidates with only regional appeal from becoming president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, as explained by Judge Posner in his piece, ""Swing States."" This means that voters in these states, who are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and carefully consider their choices, have a considerable impact on the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to tailor their policies and messages to address the concerns of these swing states, ultimately ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the ability to decide the election.

The Electoral College also offers specific advantages to large states. As Judge Posner argues in his article, ""Big States,"" the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. In the Electoral College system, a large state like Florida, with a close popular vote, receives a significant number of electoral votes. This incentivizes candidates to pay more attention to large states during their campaigns, ensuring that the concerns of these populous states are adequately represented.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid the need for run-off elections. As mentioned by Judge Posner in his article, ""Avoid Run-Off Elections,"" in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and additional costs associated with run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be preserved as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its certainty of outcome, ability to ensure that the president is everyone's president, focus on swing states, representation of large states, and avoidance of run-off elections all contribute to a fair and balanced system. While there are arguments to be made for a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides significant advantages that should not be overlooked.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will give due consideration to the strengths of the Electoral College and its impact on our democratic processes.

Subject: The Necessity of Retaining the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing this letter to express my support for the continued existence of the Electoral College as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While there are arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe that the Electoral College serves several important functions that are crucial to the democratic process.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, disputes over the popular vote are more likely compared to disputes over the Electoral College vote due to the winner-take-all system used by most states. This system ensures that the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College surpasses their share of popular votes, reducing the likelihood of close elections resulting in prolonged disputes and uncertainty.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the concept of a president who represents the entire nation. As Posner emphasizes, no region of the United States has enough electoral votes to independently elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign in various regions and work towards building broad national appeal, rather than focusing solely on certain regions or swing states. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the diverse interests and needs of the entire country, not just those of a specific region.

Additionally, the Electoral College highlights the significance of swing states in presidential elections. Posner notes that the winner-take-all system compels candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on these toss-up states. These states receive more attention from candidates, which encourages voters to become more engaged, informed, and thoughtful in their decision-making process. The involvement of swing states in determining election outcomes ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters hold the power to decide the fate of the nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College safeguards the interests of larger states in the political balance - a factor that is often overlooked. As Posner explains, the Electoral College balances the influence of smaller states by allowing larger states to have more electoral votes. This ensures that the concerns and needs of these populous states receive the attention they deserve during presidential campaigns, preventing them from being overshadowed by smaller states and ensuring a fair representation of interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the election process. A clear winner is always produced, as opposed to scenarios where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote. This stability and efficiency in the electoral process alleviates the pressure for run-off elections and allows for a smoother transition of power.

I understand that there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as those outlined by Bradford Plumer in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" However, it is vital to consider the practical reasons outlined by Judge Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" which I have highlighted.

In conclusion, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome, promotes a president who represents the entire nation, involves swing states in the decision-making process, balances the interests of larger and smaller states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to carefully consider the significance of these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College in presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I greatly appreciate your dedication to serving our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the community as a whole. This idea is gaining popularity around the world as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable and livable communities. By exploring examples from Germany, France, and Colombia, it becomes clearer how limiting car usage can benefit citizens.

In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have willingly given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. This has led to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, as cars are responsible for 12% of these emissions in Europe. By not owning cars, residents are able to rely more on public transportation and other forms of alternative transportation like bicycles. This not only reduces emissions but also leads to a healthier lifestyle, as walking and biking have physical and mental health benefits.

Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to high levels of pollution. This ban led to a significant decrease in congestion and improved air quality. The ban on cars allowed people to explore alternative modes of transportation such as buses, taxis, and walking. This event, known as the Day Without Cars, promotes alternative transportation methods and reduces smog in the city.

In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day has become an annual event. This day aims to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work. By doing so, they are not only reducing emissions but also easing traffic congestion and creating a more enjoyable and stress-free commuting experience.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. In the United States, car ownership and driving rates have been on the decline, even before the recession. This decrease in driving has implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in America, so reducing car usage can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, this shift in behavior can lead to a decrease in demand for new cars, negatively impacting the car industry. However, this shift can also create opportunities for new transportation options and services, such as car-sharing programs and public transit.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and communities. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more livable and sustainable communities, improve air quality, decrease congestion, promote alternative transportation methods, and even have economic benefits. By looking at various examples from around the world, it becomes apparent that embracing a car-free lifestyle can lead to a better quality of life for everyone. It is important for individuals and policymakers to consider these advantages and work towards creating communities that are less dependent on cars.",1
"People are finally opening their eyes to the world around them, and realizing the way things are, could be changed. The automotive world is steadily declining, in an attempt to help our world, and it's not all that bad. Less cars are being bought, less emissions are being released into the atmosphere, and people are seeing the advantages of limited car usage.

""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders."" Derived from the source, "" In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars ""This place is called Vauban, it's a suburb in which 70% of families don't own cars, and 57% actually sold their car to move here. Car ownership is allowed here, there are only two places to park however, and both are very expensive. People in this city alone have not only reduced greenhouse gas emissions, they've helped the world by giving a new perspective on living, and they've even made themselves feel better in the process. Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Advantages of a car reduced community didn't just stop here, other places around the world are seeking out the benefits of limiting car use, and adopting some of the same aspects of this experiment.

""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" The smog was horrible, people were even comparing it to Bejing. The city of Paris was engulfed in the choking air caused by the cars that conjested the streets. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."" Paris generally had more smog than a number of European capitals. However, the ban worked exceptionally well. The smog had cleared enough in one weekend for the ban to be lifted the following Tuesday. Imagine if every community were to try something like this, just imagine how clean the air would be. Not only would the world be healthier, we'd be healthier ourselves if we just limited car usage even a miniscule amount.

Not only is the world becoming healthier as a whole an advantage to lower car use, all the way down to our communities would become better also. ""The day without cars is an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s."" People go a whole day without using cars, with the exception of buses or taxis, and those that do use cars get fined. The citizens bike and hike and enjoy life without breathing in the smog that usually plagues the air. This event has caused some major improvements to the city. ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor."" Also, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This entire city has reaped the benefits of just one day without cars. Citizens here have not only began to improve themselves, but have also improved the world around them.

In conclusion, the advantages of limited car usage are finally being noticed throughout the world. Cities are experimenting and gathering results of not only better health in people in these communities, but even better living in the long run. Cities are becoming denser to make walking easier, sports centers and better sidewalks are blooming into city living, and people are even feeling better themselves from these experiments. Throughout the world limting the use of cars is spreading, and every where it goes people are seeing an upside. The more people that try to limit car usage, the better it will be, for the world, and for us as people.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a topic of discussion in recent years due to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. While cars have long been the linchpin of suburban life, there are several advantages to reducing car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study cited in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can drastically decrease these emissions, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment.

Another advantage is the improvement in air quality. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer explains how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of air pollution and create cleaner and safer cities.

Limiting car usage also promotes more sustainable and compact communities. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" Rosenthal discusses Vauban, a car-free community in Germany. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, and car ownership is restricted to two large garages at the edge of the development. This promotes a more walkable and bike-friendly community, where stores are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for long commutes and reliance on cars.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a decrease in traffic congestion and improved efficiency of transportation systems. In Andrew Selsky's article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" he describes how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets free of traffic jams. This not only reduces the time spent in traffic but also improves the overall efficiency of transportation, making it easier for people to travel to work and other destinations.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, promotion of sustainable communities, and decreased traffic congestion. By actively promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free or car-restricted zones, we can create a more environmentally friendly and efficient transportation system. It is important for individuals, communities, and governments to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies and infrastructure that support sustainable and accessible transportation options.",1
"People all over the world are saying goodbye to their cars and saying hello to different, oldfashioned ways of transportation. This new trend involves walking, bike riding, and other types of public transportation. Certain cities, like Vauban and Paris, have started to set limitations on car usage. These limitations include days where cars with specific license plates are not allowed to drive that day or even complete days where no driving is allowed, failure to follow these rules results in a fine. Most citizens of these towns have been following these rules and have found to be quite rewarding. These advantages include stress relief and a happier attitude, less greenhouse emission into the atmosphere, and a overall better environment. Limiting car usage is more beneficial than it is negative.

One of the most beneficial parts of not using a car often would be the loss of stress and a increase in a happy attitude. Most people who have participated in the limitation of car use have had positive feed back. One woman in Vauban, Germany, where most citizens are giving up their cars, said ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Rosenthal, 3. Another man in Bogota, Colombia participating in their carfree day said ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress...' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Selsky, 24. All around people who have joined this trend have started to become happier and less stressed as the start to leave their cars behind.

Another advantage of limiting car usage would be less greenhouse emission into the atmosphere. Cars play a huge part in greenhouse emission into the atmosphere, so limiting the usage would have such a positive result. According the the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive ares in the United States."" Rosenthal, 5. Knowing that, cutting out cars would minimize the greenhouse gas emission a huge percent in certain regions, like the United States. The article The End of Car Culture discusses how the amount of people who own cars keeps getting progressively lower each year, which will help with greenhouse emission. After discussing statistics of the amount of people who own cars in America, the article goese on to say, ""If this pattern persists and many sociologoists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest sourse of America's emissions..."" Rosenthal, 34. With limiting the amount of car usage the atmosphere will be exposed to a lot less greenhouse emission.

One huge advantage of limiting the usage of cars would be a overall better environment. Many cities are so polluted and have air filled with smog, like Beijing and Paris. Some of this smog comes from cars. Paris is doing something to stop their smog from becoming any worse, they are banning driving. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Duffer, 11. A similar situation is happening in Bogota, Columbia. Bogota started a carfree day to help with their situation. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Selsky, 21. These new limitations on car usage are going to help save the environment.

Overall, the limitations that are being put on car usage have many advantages. The lack of car usage in certain areas is helping to create a better environment, give out less greenhouse emission, and give people a happy attitude. Putting limitations on car usage has benefited many areas and continues to benefit them now. Most of these places are continuing to progress and put more limitations on cars as they head into a nicer, brighter future.",0
"The electoral college has many reasons it should stay , but more reasons why it should be gone. The electoral college is giving people false hope in the election, yet many people think there choosing the president , or they have voice when really the choose the electors who choose the president. The election should be chosen by popular vote adderall it is the peoples ""say"" who runs there country.

In the electoral college who really has a voice apparently not the people. In the article ""What is the Electoral College "" author ""The Office Of The Federal register"" it proclaims "" You help choose your state electors when you vote for president because when you chose your candidate you actually vote for your candidates electors. It is evident that many people really not dont know who there ""voting"" for in the democratic government. We have discovered the decision isn't in the people hands , but did we think about how ""the electors could always defy the will of the people"" in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" author Bradford Plumer says , and he makes a valid point no matter if your candidate wins by a landslide the electors still choose who becomes president.

Another reason why the electoral college should be changed into popular vote is because each has a different amount of electors. If you thought not being able to actually your president was wrong, but what about your state having fewer or more electoral votes ,and thats the deciding factor on if your candidate wins. Author of the "" The indefensible Electoral College"" Pulmer states ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voter, because of the winnertake all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they hace no chance in winning"". The electoral college should be done away with immediately not only is the democratic system is not so democratic , but its not letting the peoples voice be heard.

furthermore it is evident that the election should be based on popular votes. And if its based on popular votes the people voices will be heard , and they will actually have a say in which candidate wins. And isn't that why America is so special because it lets peoples voices be heard. Dont take that distinctive factor away because it makes Of America what it is today "" "".",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages, from saving money, from helping save the planet. We spend tons and tons of dollars on a simple fossil fuel just so we can get around. Although, having a car may be nice, but also you may need to think about the long term consequences that are yet to come. For example, driving around while fun, is dangerous, you are facing the threats of drunk drivers, people not paying attention or something in general going wonky with your car, or how incredibly expensive cars are, you must buy the gas fill it up almost every two days, you will have to pay for any damages and also for the tune ups. Cars arent just expensive but they also do loads of damage to the environment. Cars, create fumes that are let out into the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. Sure, it may be nice to drive a big bubba truck with huge tires, some smoke stacks and to be able to ""roll coal"" but also think about what that does to the earth, it helps melt glaciers causing polar bears to be hot and hungry.

Driving a car may be convenient, but when something is convenient something else has to suffer. This something else would be the environment, there is less and less clean air for us to breathe, everything is getting hotter and everyone is suffering. Smog is one of the most relevant and visible issues, especially in bigger cities. Smog is a mixture of smoke, and fog, this smoke coming from vehicles and mostly factories. Going into a major city like New York City may be fun but while your there look around and notice the thick layer of smog. You are breathing all of that through out your body. While New York City may not be the foggiest city around such as Beijing Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, Line 14 but it is still an on going issue everywhere.

All in all, leaving your car at home and taking a bike to work instead can have many health benefits but also many environmental benefits, so next time you think about bringing your car to work, think of the polar bears and the future of the environment.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the benefits it provides in our presidential election process. While some argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College better serves our democratic principles and safeguards against potential issues that may arise with a direct election.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcomes. With the winner-takes-all system in place, the winning candidate's share of the electoral votes often exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the results of the election are less likely to be disputed compared to a purely popular vote system, as witnessed in the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College minimizes the chances of a nationwide tie, which would require a run-off election and complicate the process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region in our country has a voice in the election. In a direct popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the concerns and interests of less populated rural areas. By requiring candidates to appeal to different regions, the Electoral College promotes a more balanced representation and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president. This ensures that the elected president is ""everyone's president,"" taking into account the diverse needs and interests of the entire nation.

The swing state phenomenon also highlights the significance of the Electoral College. In a popular vote system, candidates would predominantly concentrate on large population states, disregarding the concerns and perspectives of smaller states. The winner-takes-all method employed by the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states where the election outcome is uncertain. This encourages candidates to engage with voters from a variety of states and ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are eager to listen and consider different perspectives, play a decisive role in determining the election outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College preserves the political balance for larger states. The apportionment of Senate seats grants small states a proportionally larger influence than their population size would warrant, compensating for the potential imbalance caused. The Electoral College further accentuates this balance, as larger states receive more attention from candidates, both in terms of campaigning and addressing regional issues. This ensures that the presidential election process accommodates the interests and concerns of both small and large states, promoting a fair and equal representation.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate secures a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. By avoiding run-off elections, the process remains streamlined and preserves the stability and effectiveness of our democratic system.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states dominated by one party, leading to voter apathy, it is essential to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences. Additionally, the Electoral College reduces the likelihood of contested elections and guarantees that voters' voices are respected, irrespective of the state's political leanings.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in ensuring certainty of outcomes, promoting regional representation, encouraging candidates to engage with swing states, maintaining political balance, and avoiding run-off elections. It fosters a fair and democratic election process that takes into account the diverse needs and interests of our nation. I respectfully urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and to support its continuation in our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting car usage has many advantages. It would have advantages like less pollution in the atmosphere, congestion between the streets would be reduced, and people would be more interactive with the outside world. The limitation of car usage has showed many improvement all over the world.

According to the first source in the passage ""In german suburb, Life goes on without cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. In source 2 ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, it says that when there is cold nights and then it is warm during the day, the warmer layer of the air traps the gas emissions from the cars. There are all statements that prove that the gas that is emitted into the air by the car affects our atmosphere. If there is tons of cars out during the day all at the same time, they are all polluting the air which affects us all. The amount of pollution coming from factories and other things is already way too much for us to be adding even more gas emission into the atmosphere. Also, there are not only little cars but different sizes of cars ranging from extra large to small. Some cars let out more pollution than others but when all the pollution from all the cars come together, it is a gigantic problem.

Congestion is something that happens in many places where cars are used alot. In Miami, congestion is a big problem and it is very stressing specially during afterschool hours. In source 2, it says that when France passed the law in which even numbered or oddnumbered license plate had a certain time where they could not drive, the congestion went down up to 60 percent in the capital. Imagine the amount of congestion that was avoided each day by passing that law. In source 3, they state that they had a carfree day in Bogota, the capital of Colombia and it left the streets devoided of traffic jams. They also assure that it was a great way to take away stress. Stress is often caused by very long traffic jams in very populated cities such as Miami or Bogota.

If the usage of cars was limited, people would be more interactive. We would see more people walking and riding bikes. We would carpool with friends and instead of just driving to a place where the person is going to be in a car from point A all the way to point B, people would interact more with one another. Talk to people while they walk, use public transportation and it would benefit local bussiness even. In sorce 1, they say that in the new approach of limiting the access of cars, stores would be placed by a walkside, somewhere you can walk to instead of being placed inside a mall along a distant highway. In source 3, it says that the limited amount of automobiles has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, parks and sports centers have bloomed and even the sidewalks have improved!

The advantages of limiting the car usage are so great. Not only do they reduce pollution and congestion but also make people become more interactive with the outside world. It is something that benefits us all in many ways.",0
"Cars! Cars! Cars! Some might say that you cant even live without them. Which is why cars and motors have become a serious problem all through out the globe. Passages like "" The end of a car culture"" Source 4 By Elisabeth Rosenthal and "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota "" Source 3 By Andrew Selsky, Explain and show to the reader that The pollution that is caused by engines have become a serious problem through out the world and we need to limit car usage now!

Source 4, Explains The actions that our president Barack Obama is Taking to make the world a safer And Cleaned air place. By limiting car use it can help us tramendisly but what you do to make that happen is key. As written, Studies show that americans are purchasing fewer cars, licenses, and also driving as more and more years go by. Some might have a different opinion or perspective and say that cars are their life and that is the only way they will function. While others see and appreciate the advantages of limiting car usage. Many things including Less traffic, less accidents , more safety , and better health come as positive outtakes for lessening automotive use. One thing surprisingly that is good for your health as a result of no cars is cycling. ""New yorks bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities"". I can see that just by leaving your car once a week at home and using a bike, You can get a workout , arrive at your destination quicker, and you might even get into the habit of leaving your car at home more often. So it does'nt hurt to try it once, Plus you can also save about thirty bucks which is fine by me and my wallet.

Source 3 , Explains the rules and laws that some countries are making to prevent less auto use and cleaner air. Andrew emphasizes on the program in Bogota,Columbia that makes a mandatory carfree daytwo days throughout the well populated city. Over all it was a great turn out ,but know matter where you go their is always going to be some of those hard headed people who just dont like the whole concept. Which of course those violators are fined with twentyfive dollars. I think this was a great idea in showing that the city does care about the environment and care about the peoples safety and health."" It is a Good opportunity to take Away stress and air pollution..."" as well.

Cars! As much as we love them they are some what damaging so it wont kill you if you just give it a rest and try cycling or walking ,you can benefit from it in many ways and it might even save some ecosystems.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and societies. As evident in the passage set, reducing car dependency can result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, reduced congestion, and even positive cultural shifts. These benefits demonstrate the need to implement measures to limit car usage and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can be as high as 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, emissions can be drastically decreased. For example, the German suburb of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free policy, leading to a decrease in car ownership and emissions. This shows that limiting car usage can play a crucial role in combating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Smog, a major environmental issue in bustling cities like Paris, can be significantly reduced by implementing driving bans. In Paris, a partial driving ban has successfully reduced congestion by 60 percent and improved air quality. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, or walking, cities can mitigate the negative impact of car emissions and improve the overall health of their residents.

Limiting car usage also helps alleviate congestion on the roads. The car-dependent nature of suburbs contributes to traffic congestion, especially during rush hours. By adopting the principles of ""smart planning,"" which prioritize public transportation and reduce space for parking, suburbs can become more compact and accessible. Vauban serves as an exemplary model, with its emphasis on walkable streets, proximity to stores, and limited parking spaces. Implementing similar practices in suburbs around the world can help reduce traffic congestion and create more livable communities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to positive cultural shifts and changes in behavior. The trend of reducing car ownership and driving less can have long-term implications for both the environment and the car industry. Research suggests that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift can benefit carbon emissions and the environment. Younger generations, in particular, are less interested in owning cars and prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, or using public transit. This change in behavior can have profound effects on urban planning and transportation systems.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has significant advantages for individuals and societies. Reducing car dependency can lower greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, alleviate congestion, and spark positive cultural shifts. By taking inspiration from successful models like Vauban, implementing driving bans like in Paris, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a society that is less dependent on cars.",1
"Dear senator, I strongly believe that we should demolish the electoral college system. It is highly unfair and can cause the wrong person to win. The system also has and will continue to cause controversy and rightfully so.

To begin with, the electoral college system is extremely unfair. With this system in play it is fairly easy for the wrong candidate to be elected it has happened before where the person with the most popular votes meaning they had the majority rule has lost because of the way the opposing system is run. This occasion may occur from time to time because when voting you are voting for the electors not the actual president that you want to win. The system is very faulty and there is no guarantee that the electors will vote for whom they are saying they will.

To continue, the system has caused and will continue to cause great amounts of controversy. Some people may refer to it as undemocratic, outdated or even irrational. Even though all people may not agree with it there are reasons it is still in action. It is highly unlikely for there to be a tie, the swing states play a huge role in being the deciding factor of who wins and it allows all states to be equal in the amount of electoral votes they put in in ratio to the population of the states. So there are some good things about the electoral college but some will surely argue that they are not enough to outway the bad. Maybe we should just get rid of the college and take the easy way out by using majority rule. It really does make the most sense.

Lastly, the system makes some people feel as if their votes are worthless. In states such as texas that is made up of mostly republicans the democrats do not feel it necessary to vote because of the system. If most of the people are republican then the democrats already know that the opposite side will get the most electoral votes therefore it is pointless for them to vote. Another state in which this occurs is california where the majority of people are democratic therefore the republicans dont feel the need to vote. In my opinion everyones vote matters so we should run the elections that way.

To conclude. the electoral college should be done away with. It makes people feel like their opinions on the matter of who runs this country dont actually matter. It is highly faulty meaning the candidate with the most votes does not always win and lastly the system causes loads of controversy and will continue to until the problem is solved.",0
"Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed. Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote. The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated. Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today? This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.

There are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives. According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, ""the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" This, of course, would not reflect the nation's vote, and would anger millions of people. If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.

Another flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election. Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3. ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes."" This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people. Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation's vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system. This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.

The popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States. According to Source 2, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote? It only makes sense. Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.

Some may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it ""produces a clear winner,"" Source 3. But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements. If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation's votes still win the election? Will it always produce a clear winner? What about the event of a tie? Or, what about when the ""winner"" did not win the majority of the votes?

In conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary. The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a system based on a popular vote, I believe that preserving the Electoral College has its merits and provides several advantages that promote fairness, stability, and representation.

One of the main benefits of the Electoral College is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of a dispute over the election outcome, as the state by state winner-takes-all system provides a definitive result for each state. In comparison, a direct popular vote could lead to prolonged disputes, as witnessed in the 2000 election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the idea of a president for everyone. ""Everyone's President"" is a term used by Posner to describe how the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that candidates must appeal to voters from different regions and not solely focus on one particular area. As a result, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and interests of individuals from diverse regions, fostering a sense of unity and giving everyone a stake in the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as highlighted in Posner's article. These states are crucial in determining the election outcome, and the winner-takes-all approach motivates candidates to invest time and resources in these swing states. This leads to greater engagement and attention from voters in these states, allowing them to make informed decisions and have a more significant impact on the election.

The Electoral College also provides representation to smaller states, as mentioned in Posner's article. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, small states receive a more proportionate share of the electoral vote. This counteracts the potential imbalance caused by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Consequently, presidential candidates are obliged to address the concerns of voters in both small and large states, ensuring a more balanced representation of the country's interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College saves the nation from the need for runoff elections. As highlighted by Posner, this method reduces the chances of a presidential election where no candidate receives a majority of the votes. A runoff election would greatly complicate the electoral process and potentially hinder the smooth transition of power. The Electoral College resolves this issue by producing a clear winner, even if they don't achieve a majority of the popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of the United States' presidential election system. It provides stability, representation for smaller states, trans-regional appeal for candidates, and a clear outcome. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the advantages offered by the Electoral College outweigh the potential disadvantages. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the future of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe that the Electoral College system has served our nation well for over two centuries and should be maintained.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all system ensures that even a slight plurality in a state can result in a landslide electoral-vote victory. While it is not impossible for a tie in the nationwide electoral vote to occur, it is highly unlikely. This certainty helps provide stability and legitimacy to the election process.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures every region of the country is taken into account during the election. With the need to appeal to a wide range of states, candidates are encouraged to campaign in different regions and address the concerns and interests of voters across the nation. This helps prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and ensures that the interests of all regions are considered. As Judge Posner points out, this is crucial for maintaining a united and representative federal government.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the outcome is less predictable, receive the most attention and the most thoughtful voters. This ensures that the decision of the election is made by those who have closely evaluated the candidates and their policies. By focusing on swing states, candidates are encouraged to address the needs and concerns of a diverse range of voters, resulting in a more balanced and representative election process.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small states. As Judge Posner notes, large states receive more attention from presidential candidates due to the additional electoral votes they have. This helps to counterbalance the mal-apportionment of the Senate, where small states have an equal number of senators despite having smaller populations. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account during the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This avoids the complications and costs associated with organizing and conducting additional elections. Instead, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, ensuring a smooth transition of power and stability in our democracy.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as the belief that it is unfair to voters and encourages candidates to focus on swing states only, I believe that the advantages of this system outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides certainty, encourages a trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances power between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained as the method of selecting the President of the United States. Its ability to provide certainty, consider the interests of different regions, encourage candidates to campaign widely, balance power between large and small states, and prevent run-off elections make it a valuable and necessary part of our democratic process. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"""CarFree Cities"" gave the reader a broad perspective on the advantages of limiting car usage. The world would become a more ecofriendly and overall good place if we were to make this change happen all over the world. The passages give great reasoning to why this change should happen.

Limiting our usage on cars would help the environment completely. The amount of pollution would have a massive decrease. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced partial driving ban to clear the air."" This statement comes from the passage, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" and gives an example on how having driving restrictions would make the world more healthy for the economy. Using other ways for transportation could help prevent the enormous amount of pollutants in the air, like bicycles or car pooling. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" This example shows ways we can have transportation instead everyone individually using cars and causing more pollution.

Instead of driving, riding a bike or walking to the places you need to go could be a huge stress reliever. People need to go outside and get fresh air, this can happen if we decrease the use of our cars or vehicles. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This statement was said in the passage, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" and gives a perfect example on how using different types of transportation can relieve one's stress and lower the pollution on the world and the economy.

When no longer using so many cars, and vehicles the traffic would decrease majorly. Not as many people would be driving if carpooling or using other ways of transportation like bikes. This will also make the number of wrecks or accidents go down since not as many people would be in the situation for this to happen. Having less accidents would also save lots of lives, so many people die or get severly injured from car accidents and this can be a way to keep so many deaths or injuries from happening.

The idea of having a carfree environment is a great plan for the future and would be a positive change for the world and the environment we live in.",0
"Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other environmental effects have plagued the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. ultimately, as people begin the shift from automobile transport certain economic, environmental, and societal advantages will benefit the world we live in today.

In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of ""carfree"" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very beneficial, to the environment and daily life. For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in which they have a car free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting transportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, restaurants, and shopping districts being created.

In Paris, nearrecords pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday. These notacable environmental effects were so substantial in such a short amount of time, that it could spawn a whole new wave of car banning cities to help thier local environment. If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local environment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases.

The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions. Although this would hurt the car industry, it would help other parts of the economy like agriculture and ocean based fishing, by helping these ecosystems to produce more effectivly. Places like New York also have bikesharing programs, which would have a impact on people's health too. Most people do not realize the postitive effects that daily exercise can have upon yourself. For example if every person in New york walked to where they work every morning new york would experiance a wave of healthy, happy, individuals. Even large car companies like ford are stating that pedestrain, bicycle, and public trasprotation save time, lower emissions and improve safety.

Overall, benefits of reducing car transportation is too great to be ignored. It is a step in the right direction that people are taking action and rising up for the greater good of their local towns and spreading awareness by these actions. Our future could go either way, we can continue on this path and do whats right for the environment, or neglect the earth we live on and face the consequences.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to advocate for the continuation of the Electoral College as the method of selecting the president of the United States. While there are compelling arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College holds several advantages that make it the better choice.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome is reduced when compared to a direct popular vote. With the winner-take-all basis used by most states, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This sense of certainty and clear decision-making is important for maintaining a stable political environment.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is everyone's president. Unlike a popular vote system, the Electoral College requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, which encourages candidates to campaign in a diverse range of states and appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and promotes a president who can represent the interests of the entire nation.

Thirdly, the focus on swing states in the Electoral College system makes campaigns more engaging and thoughtful. As supported by Judge Posner's argument, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes motivates candidates to concentrate their efforts on swing states. This leads to more intensive campaigning and a higher level of attention given by voters in those states. Swing state voters are more likely to be thoughtful and informed, resulting in an election where the most engaged citizens have a greater say in determining the outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the power between big and small states. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College grants more attention to large states due to their larger number of electoral votes. This helps to restore balance, as the mal-apportionment of the Senate disproportionately affects small states. By giving more weight to large states in the presidential election process, the Electoral College ensures that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into consideration.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity of the election process and provides a clear winner. As demonstrated by past elections, such as Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has successfully avoided the need for run-off elections while still producing a decisive result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has shown its value in providing certainty, ensuring a president who represents all regions, promoting thoughtful campaigns, balancing the power between states, and avoiding run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for a popular vote system, I believe the advantages and practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College outweigh the disadvantages. I kindly urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the selection process for the president of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing you continue the important work you are doing for our state.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This can be seen in the experiences of various communities around the world that have adopted car-free living. For example, in Vauban, Germany, streets are completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move to the community. The citizens of Vauban have discovered several advantages of limiting car usage.

Firstly, limiting car usage promotes a healthier lifestyle. In Vauban, residents are finding that they are much happier and less stressed now that they no longer rely on cars. Walking and cycling have become the primary modes of transportation, leading to increased physical activity and improved overall fitness. Furthermore, the absence of cars on the streets has created a quieter and more peaceful atmosphere, allowing residents to enjoy the serenity of the community.

Secondly, limiting car usage reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Automobiles are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent. By limiting car usage, communities like Vauban are able to make a significant impact in reducing their carbon footprint and combating climate change.

Thirdly, limiting car usage encourages the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This smart planning approach makes it easier for residents to access daily necessities without relying on cars. Similarly, in other car-free communities like Bogota, Colombia, millions of people have hiked, biked, skated, or taken buses to work during car-free days. These initiatives promote alternative transportation methods and reduce traffic congestion, creating more livable and vibrant cities.

Finally, the trend of limiting car usage is gaining momentum worldwide. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car-reduced communities, and there are expectations for public transportation to play a larger role in future transportation bills. Moreover, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including promoting a healthier lifestyle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating more sustainable communities, and improving overall quality of life. As more communities around the world adopt car-free living, it becomes evident that limiting car usage is not only beneficial for individuals but also for the environment. It is time for us to reconsider our dependence on cars and embrace alternative transportation methods for a brighter and more sustainable future.",1
"Every four years america as a whole chooses on who should be the president of the united states. The process of election is straight forward and always follows the same process every election. The american citizens vote on one of the two candidates, then those votes are counted and giving to the electors, then the electors of each state representing the population of said state including the District of Columbia votes one of the candidates, after all votes are tallied the winning candidate is elected president. Overall this system seems rather complicated and can be seen as an unfair process at which only to vote on who takes charge of america. The electoral college should be replaced by who receives the most popular votes from all american citizens and not the state electoral.

Electoral college is a process created during the founding of the united states as sort of a ""middleground"" or compromise on how the people of the country should elect the president . In order for a president to be elected out of the 538 electors that make up the electoral college he or she must at least receive 270 votes . Each president has a group of electors that process your votes in order to choose who the state votes for making it in a ways unfair. This system can come with its own set of problems that include replacement of electors, electors voting to who they feel, and at times one candidate gaining the most popular vote but losing the chance of presidency because of the lack of electoral votes form the state . An example of the unbalanced power is the near success of the louisiana legislature replacing the democratic electors in the 1960, segregation with new ones that would oppose against John F. Kennedy making him lose the popular vote.

The best replacement for the electoral college is to allow the citizens of america to vote upon who should be the president of the U.S without the need for electors. The candidate that receives the most votes is the one who becomes the president of the united states. In order to process all possible millions of votes into a rational percentage and the candidate with the higher percentage would in turn become president. With this in mind the candidates would need to visit all or largely selected states in order to deliver campaign speeches to persuade the population to vote for them, because with the electoral college system candidates would focus mainly on tight races in the ""swing states"" practically ignoring other like in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see their candidate . The electoral college only focuses on the large numbers and not on the smaller population that can still make a difference making the system unfair. Making them only focus on the big states because how many electoral votes it could bring compared to a smaller state which could possibly only supply three.

On the other side electoral college does have a good standing as a method of vote. Electoral college has five good reasons on why it shouldn't be replaced and they are certainty of outcom, everyone's president, swing states, Big states, and avoid runoff elections . Each campaign party chooses their electors which rarely end in betrayel making it possible to win the election with low popularity votes. The electoral system also gives the candidate a chance to win in a ""landslide"" because of the winnertakeall basis at which it follows . No region has enough votes to elect a president also the electoral college needs to have transregional appeal. And the main goal of the electoral college is to obviously elect a new president but as well avoid runoff elections.

The electoral college is an unfair system of voting because of how it all depends on a small group of selected representatives and not all of the american population as a whole. Even though it can be regarded as a fair middle ground it still has its flaws and doesnt reach out to society as a whole only focusing on the states that can lead to victory, casting out those who's electoral votes will not make much of a difference. In the end the voting system should mainly focus on popularity of a candidate than what the ""state"" feels they should vote for because of how many votes they actually received for a given candidate due to the fact that it may end up voting on which who they feel and refuse to vote for their partys candidate. The electoral system should be replaced.",0
"Cars in this century are being band for multiple reasons. To most people, cars are a hastle and a pain to deal with. Advantages to limiting car usage are the less parking areas and more community buildings, the reduction of smogpolution, and more exercise for Americans. Most cars are getting better with the limitation on gas and more on battery, but we should still limit cars in general.

If you walk along the streets in New York, you will see that along every sidewalk there is a parking strip and around every corner there is a parking lot. What if those parking spots were gone? We could have larger and more store then we have now, plus we could have larger sidewalks to bike and walk on. In Vauban, Germany, generally street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. The house owners are allowed to own cars, but transportation is limited due to the limited parking areas. Suburban inhabitants mainly use a source of public transportation because of how cheap and easy it is.

Smog is a fume that comes from cars and lingers around that area. It makes the whole area fill up with gas that it looks like a huge fog bank. China is the worst contributor to smog due to all its factories which make cars. Paris is trying to limit the amount of smog in their area so they restricted the use of cars for five days. After the five days, Paris cleared up and the people there were able to see a lot clearer.

America is known to be a fat country. All the people in American sit around and eat everything, are really lazy, and rely to much on machines. If we cut down on machines, including cars, a whole lot of Americans would lose a lot of weight. Larger sidewalks would help a whole lot for bikes. Bikes would give you exercise and help you be self relient instead on relying on the car. A professor at The University of Michigan has a son who lives is San francisco, who he says has a car but never uses it. He always uses the public transportation, and why's that? More than likely it is because in San francisco the traffic changes rapidly and you don't know if you will hit bad traffic. Also, San francisco is a beautiful place to be, and he may want to enjoy the view in that area.

Cars have taken over the United States in many ways that we know about but don't care or don't do anything about it.. America and everwhere else could have a lot more stores and get more exercise if parking lots, parking spots along the sidewalk, and some cars are gone. Smog is not a good gas to have lingering around where a whole bunch of people are walking and living. Cars are great, no question, we can live a healthier life if we didnt have them.",0
"To whome this may concern the electoral college is out dated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representatives witch would be another unfair vote, because each representative stands for everyone in the state. So if the representative in MA was demcrait and the representative in TX was republican then the morty vote would most likely go to the republicans.

Other examples of how unfair the system is the ""winner take all"" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the the running candidates don't go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don't even get to see the adds for some candidates because that stat morty is either repubclain or democrat. That is unfair to the people that are in the opposite party in that state. Futher more the system is unfair to people in states where the morty is something different from the party they are in.

Last but not least the system is out dated. The electoral college has been around since the constution was writen but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and morty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two parragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is out dated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in who they pick. a reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the constution. although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.

In concluestion the electoral college needs to be changed due to the bias in the system along with the unfairness of the system. Also the age of the system and the fact that it seems to keep failing,And not showing any signs that it will get better. Or help with elections in a fair and approiate way. Later on in other elections.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have become an integral part of suburban life, but there are increasing efforts to limit their usage. This movement, known as ""smart planning"", aims to promote alternative transportation methods and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, suburbs can become more compact, accessible to public transportation, and environmentally friendly. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, these emissions can be significantly decreased. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the protection of the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Car emissions contribute to air pollution, which can have detrimental effects on human health. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in densely populated areas, the air quality can be improved, leading to better health outcomes for residents. This is particularly important in cities like Paris, where smog levels can rival those of heavily polluted cities like Beijing.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can increase accessibility to public transportation. In suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This encourages residents to use public transportation, walk, or bike instead of relying on cars for daily activities. By making public transportation more accessible and convenient, more people will be encouraged to use it, reducing the reliance on cars and alleviating traffic congestion.

In addition to these advantages, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The construction and maintenance of roads, highways, and parking spaces are costly endeavors. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there will be less need for these infrastructure investments. This can free up resources to be invested in other areas such as public transportation, education, and healthcare.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage in suburban areas. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, increasing accessibility to public transportation, and saving economic resources, the limitations on car usage can have a positive impact on the environment, public health, and the overall quality of life. It is crucial for communities and governments to embrace smart planning principles and promote alternative transportation methods to create a more sustainable future.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue to uphold this system for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe there are significant advantages to keeping the Electoral College intact.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. This system minimizes the possibility of disputes over the election results, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College would typically exceed their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election when President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied electoral vote.

Another compelling reason to maintain the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal in order to win. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it ensures that all residents, regardless of their region, feel that their voices are heard and that the President will consider their interests.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which increases engagement and attention from voters. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus on toss-up states, leading to more thoughtful and well-informed voters who make crucial decisions for the nation as a whole. This focus on swing states ensures that candidates address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, rather than solely catering to regions that are already in their favor.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate may result in a loss of weight for large states, the Electoral College provides them with a mechanism to regain some political significance. This is exemplified by the fact that a close popular vote in a large state like Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas the same margin of victory in a smaller state like Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. By giving large states more attention during the campaign process, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of their interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, preventing complications and uncertainties that arise when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. Instead, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, avoiding the need to prolong the election process with additional rounds of voting.

While critics argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in non-competitive states, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains significant despite knowing that their vote may not swing the outcome on a national level. Voters participate in elections to express their political preference, and their engagement is driven by their desire to have their stance represented, rather than the belief that a single vote may decide the entire election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the political influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While a popular vote system may seem appealing at first glance, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in ensuring fair and balanced presidential elections throughout history. I urge you to maintain and defend this essential democratic process for the benefit of our great nation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I greatly appreciate your dedication to serving our state and country.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my support for the Electoral College system and urge you to consider its value in our presidential election process. While some argue for a switch to a popular vote, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As demonstrated in the 2012 election, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps to prevent disputes over the outcome and promotes a smoother transition of power. Additionally, the winner-take-all system used in most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory, further solidifying the legitimacy and clarity of the result.

Secondly, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. In a vast country like ours, it is essential for a president to represent and understand the interests of all regions. By requiring candidates to have widespread support across different states, the Electoral College ensures that no single region holds enough electoral votes to determine the outcome. This fosters a presidency that is inclusive and representative of the entire nation, preventing candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have a clear advantage.

Thirdly, the Electoral College gives importance to swing states and ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters have a significant impact on the election. Toss-up states attract the candidates' attention and resources, resulting in a more engaged electorate that carefully considers the issues and candidates. This system allows for a more comprehensive campaign strategy that targets the concerns of diverse regions and effectively addresses the needs of the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College maintains a fair balance between large and small states. The system compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate, where large states lose some weight due to equal representation. By allocating electoral votes based on a state's population, candidates are compelled to pay attention to the concerns and interests of both large and small states. This helps prevent a scenario where a few densely populated areas dominate the discourse and allows for a more inclusive representation of the nation as a whole.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections that can complicate the election process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the requirement for additional rounds of voting, which can create logistical challenges and prolong the time it takes to finalize the election results.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, the high voter turnout in the 2012 election indicates that voters are motivated by expressing their political preference rather than solely focusing on swing states. Additionally, by maintaining a state-based system, the unique concerns and interests of each state can be better represented, promoting a more diverse and balanced presidency.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system preserves certainty, encourages trans-regional appeal, strengthens swing state involvement, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. These reasons, among others, highlight the importance of maintaining this system in our presidential election process.

I respectfully urge you to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College, as it continues to be a vital component in our democratic system. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your ongoing commitment to upholding the principles that have guided our great nation for centuries.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole. This can be seen in examples like the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and the capital of Colombia, Bogota. These places have implemented measures to reduce car dependency and have experienced positive outcomes in terms of reduced pollution, improved quality of life, and increased accessibility to alternative modes of transportation.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while car-intensive areas in the United States can reach up to 50 percent (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, as seen in Vauban and Paris, significant decreases in pollution levels and congestion have been achieved. The recent driving ban in Paris resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped clear the smog that had plagued the city (Duffer). These efforts not only improve air quality but also contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also improve the quality of life for individuals. Vauban, a car-free suburb in Germany, has shown that living without cars can reduce stress and make people happier (Rosenthal). The presence of cars in cities and suburbs often leads to traffic congestion and noise pollution. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation like walking, cycling, and public transit, individuals can enjoy quieter and less congested streets. This can create a more peaceful and pleasant living environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to increased accessibility to public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. Vauban, for example, has made stores easily accessible by placing them within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls (Rosenthal). This approach encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation to reach their destinations, reducing the need for car travel. Similarly, Bogota's car-free day promoted alternative transportation methods like walking, biking, and taking buses (Selsky). By providing better infrastructure for these modes of transportation, more people have the opportunity to utilize them and reduce their reliance on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages to individuals and society. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and creates a more pleasant living environment. Additionally, it enhances accessibility to alternative transportation methods, making it easier for people to choose alternatives to driving. As seen in examples like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, these measures have the potential to make cities and suburbs more sustainable and enjoyable places to live. It is important for individuals and communities to prioritize limiting car usage in order to reap these benefits and contribute to a more sustainable future.",1
"Fellow citizens their are many advantage to limiting your car usage. With a wide range from not getting a ticket to helping the environment, and it's a social trend, driving cars are now a thing of the past.

In Vauban, Germany a community where only thirty percent of its entire population owns vehicle. The advantages for not owning a car are displayed in this upscale community by the ability to walk, and ride a bicycles to stores, shops, and restaurants. The secret to this the innovative take on this community, is by not placing these all of stores, shops, and restaurants in some crowed mall, but accessible from a mere walking distant. Also a great way to burn off calories and in time put an end to obesity.

By reducing car usage smog and other pollutants in big cities can be drastically reduced. In Paris congestion of smog was down sixty percent, the way they got people to stop using cars was by putting a fine driving your car for the day almost 4,000 drivers were fined thirty one dollars that day. Another example of this is in Bogota, Colombia here most the millions of people were willing to give up car usage, a program that was started in the mid 1990s called the Day Without Cars with it's goal is to promote an alternative transportation. As a result of this added 118 miles of bicycle track, parks, and sports center to this city. Lower emissions of green house gases are also helping the environment with the help of Day Without Cars program.

People are slowly drifting away from their cars. The miles driven per person in the U.S. has dropped nearly nine percent since it's original peak in 1995. Many things have been suggested to reduced the car usage in the U.S. The number of car ownership per household and per person has come down three years before the downturn of car usage that started in the 2005. People in the U.S. are also more likely to retain a drivers license at an older age as to opposes to the younger age groups between 16to39yearolds.

In conclusion, the age of cars are slowly coming to an end. People are planing for the cleaner and healther future that lies ahead of us, where pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation are woven together into a connected network. The revolution is upond us.",0
"When the US Constitution was first made, the idea of equality between the states was made. This meant that the size or population of a state gave it no distinct advantage over another. They did this through the creation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, yet there was one more issue they had to solve. This issue was how they could count the votes of citizens all aroun the US fairly. They solved it with electoral college, a system in which the voters don't directly vote for the president, but vote for a group, or slate, of people who have sworn to a candidate who vote for you. This system as Source 2 states can easily be broken with a group of swing votes in some states, but because it keeps thing equal, we must see that making popular vote the process isn't a good idea, because larger states will have more power. The US should just remove the winner take all system and replace it with proportional representation"" to preserve equality and functionality.

The first reason why we must change to proportional representation is because it preserves equality. As Source 1 states, this proportional representation is only done by Maine and Nebraska, but it makes it so that one party wont win the state, it is regional in the state meaning that more people are represented through this. The winner take all system is too harsh, and can discount many people in swing and regular states. As Source 3 stated, the larger states need to be left alone to represent the US population. Proportional representation allows this with the ability to include even more opinions. With this information, it is easy to see how proportional representation will preserve the equality that popular vote represents.

The second reason why we must change to proportional representation is because it preserves functionality. One of the main arguments for electoral college, is that it is more functional as compared to popular vote. This can be maintained through proportional representation. Source 3 stated that while the regular electoral college has a chance of failing, it is not as high of a chance as popular vote is. Proportional representation keeps this functionality that those who support normal electoral college hide behind. This is also been proven to work without a hitch. As previously mentioned, Source 1 stated that this for of electoral college is already in Maine and Nebraska. These states have proven that this form of electoral college works, thus proving that we should change to proportional representation in order to maintain the functionality of regular electoral college.

In conclusion, we should switch the rules of electoral college from ""winner takes all"" to ""proportional representation"" in order to maintain equality and functionality. showing that while the founding fathers did have the best on their minds when electoral college was made, a change in it can benifit America for years to come.",0

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the issue of the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the reasons for both keeping it and transitioning to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that it is important to explore the advantages and disadvantages of each system in order to make an informed decision.

The Electoral College, as defined by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. The electors are chosen by the candidate's political party, and most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system, awarding all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

Proponents of the Electoral College, such as Judge Richard A. Posner, argue that it provides certainty of outcome by giving the winning candidate a larger share of the electoral vote than their share of the popular vote. This system reduces the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome and minimizes the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal, as stated by Judge Posner. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, so candidates are incentivized to campaign in different regions. This requirement promotes a president who will represent the interests of all regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on ""toss-up"" states, which, according to Judge Posner, are likely to be the most thoughtful voters. These voters pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions based on the available information.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large and small states. Judge Posner argues that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives large states less weight in the political balance. The Electoral College brings attention to large states during the campaign and ensures that their votes have a greater impact.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This is beneficial as it reduces the complexity of the presidential election process and ensures a clear winner.

On the other hand, critics of the Electoral College, like Bradford Plumer, argue that it is unfair to voters due to the winner-take-all system. They contend that candidates focus only on swing states, neglecting others. Plumer asserts that this system places the fate of the presidency in the hands of a small number of swing voters and does not represent the interests of all American citizens.

While both sides provide compelling arguments, it is crucial to consider the practical implications of each system. The Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and effective method of electing the President, and it offers important advantages such as certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

However, I believe that there should also be further examination and discussion on the issue, taking into account the concerns raised by the critics of the Electoral College. It is essential to find a solution that ensures every American citizen has their voice heard and that the President represents the interests of all regions and states.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the information provided from multiple sources in order to make an informed decision on the future of the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping it as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are valid concerns regarding the fairness and flaws of the Electoral College, I believe that it provides certain benefits that are crucial for our democracy.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute, it is less likely to face challenges compared to a direct popular vote. As seen in the 2012 election, President Obama received a smaller share of the popular vote but a larger share of the electoral vote, ensuring a clear victory. This system reduces the chances of an electoral tie and the resulting complications that a run-off election would entail.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of having a president who represents the entire nation. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency, candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This promotes a national campaign strategy that ensures candidates reach out to diverse regions and communities, rather than solely focusing on populous areas or swing states. It is important for a president to have broad-based support across the country in order to address the needs and interests of all citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to target swing states. Swing states, or toss-up states, play a critical role in deciding the outcome of an election. This means that voters in these states receive more attention from candidates and are likely to be more thoughtful and engaged in the electoral process. By giving greater weight to the concerns and preferences of swing state voters, the Electoral College ensures that the outcome is decided by those who are most invested and informed.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large and small states. While the popular vote may favor highly populous states, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a significant say in the election. This is important for maintaining a sense of equality and fairness among states, preventing candidates from solely catering to the needs of a few densely populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which may complicate the electoral process. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This avoids the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections that could potentially undermine the stability and efficiency of the democratic system.

While there are critics who argue for the abolition of the Electoral College, I firmly believe that it serves as a safeguard for our democracy. It ensures that every region has a voice in the election, promotes trans-regional appeal, and avoids the complications and uncertainties that can arise from a direct popular vote system.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I encourage you to carefully weigh the benefits and drawbacks of the Electoral College before making any decisions that could significantly impact our democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear The Florida State Senator, In our nation, we use a process called the Electoral College to be a deciding factor in presidential elections. I firmly believe this system has become outdated as our country has grown. This nation says it is all about the people and what's best for us it even says so in the U.S. Constitution, ""We the people.."" And what the people want, and need, is a fair presidential election, which can be established by making the popular vote the deciding factor.

When you think of any differentiation between two groups even back when you were a young child, how did you solve it? You vote. For example, say you and a group of friends are undecided on whether you want to go to the movies or the mall. So, you vote! Voting always has a fair outcome. It's simple. Whatever party has a higher number of votes wins and in this case becomes president. I certainly respect the idea and goal of the Electoral College, but it simply isn't quite effective. It does not make sense why we would get someone to be elected by people who have similar attributes to go represent them and vote for the president. It isn't very effective being that the voted Electoral College member could change their mind and vote for whomever they want instead of the candidate the people thought heshe was going to be voting for.

Think about this. Does it make sense that ""We the people"" voted for one candidate to win, but he still loses the presidency because the Electoral College overturned it? No, it does not. This is exactly what happened in Al Gore's place according to Bradford plumber's book, "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong."" Also, according to the previous cited book, due to the mishaps in Al Gore's case and others, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have know."" And similar to what was stated in the first paragraph, voters can't always control whom their electors vote for and sometimes vote for the wrong elector. All of this confusion could easily be eliminated if we eliminated the Electoral College.

Direct voting is way easier and way more accurate to whom the nation wants to be the president. It eliminates the confusion some voters may get if they are unsure which elector feels similar to how they feel about each candidate. It eliminates the hastle of electing electors in the first place. It eliminates the uncertainty voters have about each electoral candidate, being that they could change their mind whenever they please. And best of all, it eliminates the unfair, irrationality of the Electoral College.",0
"Mr Senator, After being informed of the United State's combination othe the electoral college and election by popular vote, I was asked wether or not we should keep the electoral college or change the election to just a popular vote. I thought about this for a while and I believe the electoral college is beneficial to the results of the election.

We are Americans. We can be innovative and change the world but we can also be lazy and uneducated. While most Americans are informed about the election and who is running, Mickey Mouse is still the most popular writein on the ballot. Why not have a group of citizens who represent our state and party have a say in who should be president? ""..each party slects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" Source 3. The electoral college is a group of sophisticated men and women who do this as their job. While the average American is tending to family, working or watching tv, their electors are learning the viewpoints of the presidential nominees and deciding with one they think would be the best leader of our country. Why would it be anything but harmful to our country if we got rid of it?

I understand that you might be saying that voters don't vote for the president and electors overrule the popular vote. Electors are just an easier and more equal way of distributing the votes and electing a president. Only in rare cases has the electoral vote overruled the popular vote. Have you ever thought there might be a reason behind that though? Assuming the government isn't majorly corrupt and the elections are fixed, wouldnt you think that the slate you voted for should be trusted? Maybe they know something you don't or have witnessed the candidates actions in the past that could've swayed their vote. Citizens are keen but they do not know everything that goes on behind the scenes.

The Electoral College makes sure that there is a transregional appeal. Not one area can overrule the other votes. This is very important because it evens out the votes and reduces risks of a split country who doesn't want to follow a president elected by the South. Popular vote alone doesn't do this. If we just go by who was the most votes from citizens then If there is ever a great divide in which party want which president it could also lead to a divide in the country itself. This could even lead to a civil war and make these 50 states notso united. The fact that we have a system to keep order doesn't mean that we should get rid of it just because people want their writein ballot of a cartoon character to mean more.

Keeping the Electoral College is necessary for the unity of our country. We should trust our slate of electors to vote the way we want them to. If they don't, the blame shouldn't automatically be put upon them. Since we elected the trustworthy slate, shouldn't we believe they have the best interest of the country and their party in mind? The Electoral College should stay as it is. This system keeps order, balances votes, and 99% of the time it works.",0
"The Electoral College is a process put in place by the founding fathers as a compromise for the election of the President. It is a combination gote of the Congress and of the citizens of the United States. The Electoral College is on of the most disputed political topics right now. The electoral college is a proper method for electing presidents because it forces presidential candidates to have transregional appeal and it rules out the possibility of an election where neither candidate recieves the majority of the gotes.

The Electoral College doesn't allow a candidate to win by gaining their electoral gotes from one region. As stated in source 3, ""no region has enough electoral gotes to elect a president"" meaning that if a candidate were to only campaign in a region that they knew would got for them, then there is no possible way they would win. For example, in 2012 Mitt rodney was a favorite in the south so he had no incentive on campaigning heavily in other states because that he had won the south over completely. Not only did he not win a major electoral state, Florida, but he also didn't campaign in ohter states for which he gained no electoral gotes. Even by some chance that they win, there is a very small chance of them being reelected because the regions that they didn't campaign in will feel disenfranchised and that will cause them not to gote for the president again. So if a candidate doesn't campaign in all regions that doesn't mean he won't win the election the first time, but he is likely to lose the reelection.

With the Electoral College process in place, it rules out the possibility of an candidate not winning the majority of the gotes. For example, their have been two elections where a president only had 43 percent of the popular gotes, which some people would think that would be enough, but the those presidents had the majority of the electoral gotes which is what caused them to win. Even though there is a slight possibility of this happening, there are always those couple of states that are last minute decisions and are called ""tossup states"" because nobody ever knows who will win that state over and it might be a state like Louisiana, who only has 8 electoral gotes but 8 gotes is enough to break a tie and even win the election for someone.

On the other hand, some people might argue that the Electoral College method might turn off potential goters due to a candidate showing that they have no interest in carrying that state due to what party that state carries, but no one goter can decide an election, and that is because the goter doesn't gote for what president they want, but for what electors they want who in part will gote for the candidate. Though they have a valid argument the Electoral College is still the right method for the job.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is the proper method because it forces presidents to campaign in multiple regions and it rules out the possibility of a tie in the election. The president is suppose to rule for the people and some people might not gote for a president just because they don't like them but with the Electoral College the right president wins.",0
"Politicians and the public have argued for years over one burning question: Should the Electoral College be discontinued? I believe the Electoral College should not be used in the United States anymore. To understand the faults within this system, one must understand the system at its basic level. The Electoral College is a system that consists of 538 electors. Each state has a different amount of electors, granted on the size of that state's population. When the election is held, the voter votes for the electors, not the candidate directly.

The first fault one can find while examining this system is the ""winner takes all"" policy that most states have. In paragraph seven of the first source, the article states, ""Most states have a ""winnertakesall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This system seems unfair, especially in states where the vote for electors is won by a small margin. The votes cast for the candidate who lot the electoral votes in their state are not counted in choosing the president, which hinders the ideals of democracy in this country. In paragraph nine of the second source, the article reads,"" according to a gallop poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This crisis in 2000, when George W. Bush won the electoral college, but Al Gore won the popular vote, displays the lack of clarity with this system. This election was a prime example that the president is not chosen by the popular voice, but rather by the Electoral College, which does not accurately represent everyone.

The second fault with Electoral College stems from the first issue: people are not voting because they feel as if their voice is not being heard. Stated as a counterargument in paragraph 23 of source three, the article states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method...may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" People are choosing not to vote because they feel as if their voice is being shadowed by the major political thinking in their state, and this mindset corrupts the institution of democracy in the United States.

An argument made by those in favor of the Electoral College can found in paragraph 20 of source three, ""Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign...They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and the most thoughtful voters shoule be the ones to decide the election."" This argument is opinionated and has no substantial evidence behind it. According to source 2 in paragraph 13, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This was due to the candidates spending their time, money, and efforts to win over ""swing states"", the states that could go either Republican or Democrat depending on the candidates that year.

The Electoral College is a system that should not be used anymore because it does not properly consider the opinions of all voters, turns away voters who believe they will not have their voices heard, and leave states without seeing ads or candidates during the election because these candidates are trying to win over other states.",0
"Dear Senator, I am strongly in favor of keeping the Electoral College because it not only is more efficient than popular vote, it is also smarter. The Electoral College is a foolproof way of not disputing the outcome of who gets to be in it. It avoids problems by the candidates not receiving majority of the votes cast in the election. Everyone who is in the Electoral College was cast there for a reason by the popular vote. You also must know that the system has its faults. There aren't many of them but i believe that they are needed to keep the College going and allowing it to vote the right way instead of the wrong way. All in all, i do hope that you are also in favor of the electoral college and if you aren't, hopefully this letter will let your mind sway towards being in favor of it.

First of these reasons, there are more problems with popular votes than electoral vote and have a foolproof way of keeping disputes in the low. The Electoral College is less susceptible to problems if the poular votes are used to elect the college. In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president, in the first reason it says that, ""...The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" Secondly, Having an Electoral College avoids runoff elections, where the problem is cause by each candidate that is running to not get any of the majority of the votes. To put it in more simple terms, In some cases there have been ties by the popular vote, or very close ties. In The same article as mentioned in the above paragraph provided the example of one time that this has happened. "" Nixon and Clinton both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College."" The Electoral college breaks the tie in the poular votes because they reduce the pressure of having runoff elections. The states have a ""winnertakeall"" system, so that when the elections come, the president of those who are voting for him in the electoral college get to be with that president. The larger states recieve more attention from the candidates, so the popular vote getting tied up also does not happen very often.

Last but not least, it is incredibly important to know how the Electoral College works because if you do not, then you will not know how effective of a sytem it is. In What is the Electoral College?

it states that, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president."" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president. The popuar vote actually elects the College. ""...But each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.."" and this quote was selected from I defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. The electoral college is trusted to vote for the president that they believe will make the best decisions for our country.

Even thought this might be a really improved method on picking our president, it still has faults. In what's wrong with the electoral college, is saying that ""The most worrying prosepct is the tie in the electoral college....in that case the elction would be thrown to the H.O.R., where state delegations vote on the president."" If this ever does happen, MAny people in the senate or house of representatives would have to vote and would have to rake on responsibilty of the as many as 500,00 voters.

As you know, it is important to keep the best desicions of your country in mind , while thinking about your citizens that you are representing. The electoral college answers the questions of having disputes and arguments over who becomes preseident. It is an efficient way of keeping a foolproof outcome and avoid runoff elections. You also now have some knowledge of how the electoral college worls, if you didn't have any before.",0
"Cars most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.",0
"Dear Senator, The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid runoff elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote.

The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt rodney. Transregional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute.

Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small sate in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by malapportionment of the Senate. Voters in tossup states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the the most thoughtful voters.

To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes runoff elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election.",0
"The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and antidemocratic. However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people.

As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason.

The argument that the electoral college discourages voters of the minority party to vote is a valid criticism, but it is a problem that can be solved without the loss of the electoral college. Compulsory voting would be far more effective if voter turnout is an issue. People who would not have voted otherwise would still likely vote for the candidate they supported if voting was made mandatory.

In source 2, Bradford Plumer expressed dissatisfaction with the way political campaigns involving the electoral college focus on swing states rather than allowing equal debate in all states, but that does not make for a less desirable outcome. Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed.

The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.",0
"People in today's society practically depend on their cars to get them to and from work, to buy groceries for their families, and just for the purpose of getting out of the house. Although, with billions of people driving cars every single day, it has quite a negative effect on the environment. It is in our nature to think that without a car, you could not go anywhere or do anything for that matter. Recently, cities around the world have been banning the use of cars and charging citizens with fines if cars become in use. The reasoning for this is the increased amount of pollution that diesel fuel is causing. Thus, making it difficult to breathe, walk outside, and live our everyday life.

One major problem in the use of diesel fuel has been the pollutants in the air which lead to an extreme amount of smog. Recently, Paris has had more smog than any other European capital. They knew that something had to be done to stop this, so they started a new ""carfree"" law. This resulted in a fine of 31 for the citizens who used their cars. Soon after that law had become intact, almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and just about 27 people had their cars impounded that day for their reaction to the fine.

The United States of America had long been one of the world's most prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of some of the very first car models. A lot of big cities in the U.S have a huge amount of driving going on. For example, New York City, San Fransico, Miami, Los Angeles, ect. This is leaving the country with a large amount of pollutants in the atmosphere. After President Obama's ambitions to decrease the amount of diesel fuel use, recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and are even having a decrease in the amount of licenses permitted as each year passes. In 2013, the amount of miles driven per person was about 9 percent under the usual American peak. With the large amount of citizens living in this country and the number of people only rising, this small decrease has had a very positive effect on the environment.

With almost the entire world in on this new, ""carfree"" trend, people have been perfectly fine letting go of their cars and taking on the world just by foot. In the city of Vauban, Germany the citizens there would much rather pioneer their way through life than to own a car according to Heidrun Walter, who is a resident of Vauban. ""I'm much happier this way."" She claims. Back on the other side of Earth, people are becoming more and more encouraged to use plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more passengers. This decreases the amount of fuel being burned, and a happier and healthier environment for us all to live in.

In conclusion, I believe that the decrease in the amount of cars in use has recently had a very positive effect on our environment. This has all come to show that you don't always need a car to get where you want and to do the things that you need to do. Or, if you feel the need for a car that you can rely on a friend for carpooling or purchasing a plugin car which are becoming much more popular and useful in today's society. Always remember to keep our environment happy and healthy, and always making each day better by putting the amount of diesel fuels burned by car use and the effects it has into consideration.",0
"The black smoke that leaks out of your car's tailpipe is killing you.

With its toxic chemicals, and the stress that goes along with driving ,it's no wonder why our vehicular casualty rate is so high. The answer seems to be clear,there are many advantages in reducing our car use. Not to mention the money saving opportunities and traffic reduction that come along with letting go of our beloved crutch.

The world has long bin involved in a ""love affair"" with its cars and other forms of motor transportation, and now in 2015 we are by far, paying the price.

The dangers to your personal health and the health of the environment are cringe worthy. France, being one of the most polluted ares in Europe. at one point had 147 micrograms of particulate matter in there air. As a result Pairs put a partial driving ban to clear the air and the results where drastic. In just one week the smog cleared up just enough to lift the ban. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up too 50 percent in some areas in the United states. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions. This is cold hard proof that cars are a major contribute to our carbon foot print.

Many other countries have taken the lead in ridding the world of this environmental burdon. One of the most major examples being a community in Vauban Germany. The inhabitants of this upscale community have simply given up there cars. The residents agree that the lack of cars have greatly reduced there stress. Similarly, in Bogota Colombia, they have created a set carfree day. This has encouraged other means of travel including biking, walking and skating. It's a fantastic way to lower stress and air pollution all at once. The word is now spreading through Colombia and 2 more cities have joined and municipal authorities from other countries are very excited about the event. It sparked a mass improvement leading too new sidewalks, a reduction in traffic, and more upscale businesses.

More and more people are startting to catch on. The amount of licenses registeres each year are going down drastically and people ""just dont see a need for a vehicle anymore."" A study last year showed the decress in young people driving is at 23 percent between2001 and 2009. People organize there social life or jobs around where they can take public transportation or a bike. The main point in it all is that a car is just another way to get where your going and most dont really care how they get there in the first place.

Vehicle ownership is proving to be impractical, harmful, and expensive. With the rise of pedestrian accsess, bikeing, commercial and public transportation the over use of cars is becoming obselete. We need to improve our safety and lower our emissions to keep the planet and ourselves healthy. ""The proof is in the pudding,"" life without cars is on the rise and it is welcomed with both arms open.",0
"Dear me. Senator, ever since the Presidential Election of 2000, the concept of our electoral college has been highly scrutinized, and this is rightly so. The electoral college is undemocratic, unfair, and should be replaced with the popular vote.

Even people who support keeping the electoral college such as the author of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , Richard A. Posner agree that ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.."" paragraph 15. America was founded on democracy and making sure that the people's voices were heard, and not allowing the people to directly vote for the leader of the country goes against that.

The electoral college is also extremely unfair to voters. Because of how the election system is set up, a candidate could win the people's popular vote, but not the electoral votes and would then not receive presidency. This occurred in 2000 in the Gore vs Busch election. Even though a majority of people voted for Gore, Busch still ended up with the presidency paragraph 9. Having the electoral votes take precedence over the popular vote takes away the people's voice and basically tells them that their opinion doesn't matter as much as the electoral college's opinion.

The electoral college is also unfair because it discourages campaigning in nonswing states. A democratic candidate would not campaign in a state like California that is heavily democratic because they know they are almost definitely going to win the election in that state, meaning they will get all of that state's electoral votes. A republican candidate would not campaign in california either because they know they would have almost no chance of winning in such a heavily democratic state, and they would be wasting campaign money with no hope of electoral votes from that state paragraph 13. This means that people in nonswing states like California don't really know much about either candidate because they were never informed. Then the people in these states tend to vote for their party solely because they have nothing else to go off of. It is unfair for voters in nonswing states to be left in the dark just because all of the electoral votes are almost guaranteed to go one way. If the US used popular votes for the Presidential Election, republicans in democratic states and democrats in republican states would have a voice too.

Another way the electoral college is unfair, is the standing procedure in the event of a tie. There are 538 electors in the electoral college paragraph 3 which is an even number, meaning the electoral votes for each candidate could be tied. In the event of a tie, the House of Representatives would have an election and each state would get one vote. That would mean ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" paragraph 12. This would make someone from California's vote count for much less than someone from Wyomig's vote.

It can be argued that the electoral college is beneficial in the fact that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to 51.3% of popular votes paragraph 18. Some say this is beneficial because it reduces the chance of a dispute of vote counting. However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.

The electoral college has been around for a long time, and it's time for a change. It is simply undemocratic and unfair. It prevents every person for having an equally weighted vote. The electoral college needs to be replaced with a popular vote.

Thank you for your time me. Senator.",0
"The debate on the pros and cons of car usage has been an ongoing one. Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.

To begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""source 2. This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.

In addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. ""rushhour restrictions have drastically cut traffic""source 3.

Furthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" source 1 says a citizen of a ""carfree"" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.

Hence, limiting car usage will create a better environment for people all around the world.",0
"Dear Florida state senator, I highly suggest we keep the Electoral College for many reasons, I believe to be the most valued being, with Electoral College, we can insure the certainty and fariness of the outcome. Majority of states award electoral votes with a winner takes all, type of deal. For instance, when no candidate has majority of vote, it becomes a bit of a hectic presidential election, but by using Electoral College, the result is a clear winner. Also, it is insured that there is no region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president alone. Which is great! If a candidate was eligible to be elected by a single regions appeal, that president is extremely unlikely to be a successful president.

Many people believe that Electoral college is unfair, they claim that the candidates feel they dont have to spend much time in the states that they feel they have no chance of winning in, but in reality, instead of avoid the states the candidates feel they wont get votes from, they should probably campaign there, and try to win some votes. It's about making the people like you, making them want to vote for you, not feel avoided by you, and if the candidates still dont see it that way, Electoral College has solved this problem by incorporating ""Swing States."" Voters in these tossup states listen extremely closely to the competing candidates. These voting are often the most thoughtful because they know they are going to be the deciding factor in the election.

because no region of voters can decide the election, and there is even a deciding factor of thoughtful people who are listening closely to the election, Electoral College becomes not only the fairest, but also the most successful way to elect a president.",0
"All around the world different countries have been noticing some things in life that are just better without cars or atleast less cars. With less cars things are more calming its also better for everyone, including the environment.

To begin with, things can be way more calm in a life without cars. Many people happen to believe that cars can change how you feel for example ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""3. Heidrun Walter always felt tense with a car now she feels calm and relaxed. Life with less cars can be so much more relaxing without all the loud annoying noises cars make. In Vauban they are making some changes to how the people live so they can live more easy and calm. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in a lowcar suburban life.""6. The way this civilization is all the people live close by and everything is close by so you dont really need a car. If everything is close by everything can be more fluent and calm.

In addition, it may be more calm without cars but it is also better for you and the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission in europe... and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.""5. Wherever you are in the world greenhouse gasses will most likley affect your environment in some unnatrual way and that is not the best thing for you, the people you know, or all the plants and animals. Without cars polluting earth we would be way more healthy and many animals may not be endangered or extinct like they are today.""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""7. If you drive less its not just better for the environment and your health it can also be better for your wallet. If you drive less you save money on gas that you can use for many other things. Overall driving less turns out to be better for everyone.

In conclusion, people driving less can make life easier and calmer, it is also better for people, plants, animals, and don't forget your wallet.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Car usage has long been associated with middle-class suburban life, but recent trends and initiatives are challenging this notion. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning techniques, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, these communities are not only contributing to environmental sustainability but also improving the quality of life for their residents.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By implementing car-free zones, like the ones in Vauban and Paris, these communities are actively combating air pollution. The success of these measures is evident in the significant decrease in congestion and smog levels. For example, Paris experienced a 60 percent reduction in congestion after enforcing a driving ban due to smog.

Body Paragraph 2:
Another benefit of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. Vauban, for instance, has embraced a low-car suburban lifestyle, where 70 percent of families do not own cars. Residents of this community rely on public transportation and bicycles to commute, which not only reduces their carbon footprint but also improves their overall well-being. Car-free days, like the one in Bogota, are becoming more popular worldwide, encouraging millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work instead of driving. These events play a crucial role in shifting people's behavior towards more sustainable transportation options.

Body Paragraph 3:
In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. By placing stores within walking distance and reducing space for parking, suburbs can become less dependent on cars. This approach not only reduces traffic congestion and allows for a more efficient use of space but also fosters a sense of community. In Vauban, the absence of cars has resulted in verdant streets where people can freely walk and children can play without the constant noise and pollution associated with vehicular traffic.

Conclusion:
The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly apparent in various communities worldwide. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of alternative transportation, and creation of more compact and accessible neighborhoods are all contributing to a more sustainable and fulfilling way of life. As more people embrace these initiatives, the car culture that has dominated suburban areas for decades may soon be a thing of the past. By prioritizing the environment and prioritizing the community, we can create a future that is not dependent on cars and is focused on the well-being of its residents.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This is evident in several examples from around the world, including Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, the car ban in Paris due to smog, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing dependency on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation, these initiatives have been successful in improving the quality of life for residents and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By promoting car-free communities and implementing car bans, these initiatives have been able to significantly reduce emissions. For example, during a five-day ban in Paris, congestion was reduced by 60 percent and smog levels decreased. The car-free day in Bogota also aimed to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation, leading to millions of residents using buses, bikes, and walking instead of driving.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in overall quality of life. In car-free communities like Vauban, residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed. Without the need for cars, streets are quieter and more pedestrian-friendly, creating a safer and more enjoyable environment. In addition, by reducing car dependency, these communities promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles. In Bogota, the car-free day has become a popular event, with millions of people participating in activities like biking and skating, creating a sense of community and promoting a more active lifestyle.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient use of space and resources. In car-free communities, there is less need for parking spaces and roads, allowing for more green spaces and community areas. Stores and amenities are placed within walking distance, reducing the need for large malls and distant shopping centers. This leads to more compact and accessible communities, making it easier for residents to access what they need without relying on cars. In the United States, there is a growing movement towards car-reduced communities, with the Environmental Protection Agency promoting such initiatives. This shift in planning and development aims to create communities that are less dependent on cars and more accessible to public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving quality of life, and promoting efficient use of space and resources, initiatives like car-free communities, car bans, and car-free days have shown positive results. These examples serve as evidence that a shift towards limiting car usage is not only possible but also beneficial for a more sustainable and enjoyable future.",1
"The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up and coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don't vote in the the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...,"" as shown by Richard A. Posner in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.

However, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,"" said Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong."" That being said, sure they can't control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. ""...in the Constitution as comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,""as said by the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.

Overall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment. As demonstrated by various examples around the world, such as the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and Bogota in Colombia, reducing reliance on cars can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and enhanced quality of life.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on air quality. Cars are a major source of pollution, emitting greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent. By reducing car usage, especially in suburban areas, where cars are a necessity for many families, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution in the air.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not the only environmental benefit of limiting car usage. Cars also contribute to smog, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The city of Paris implemented a partial driving ban during a period of intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. Similarly, Bogota in Colombia has been promoting car-free days, during which millions of Colombians use alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, or taking public transit. These initiatives have had a significant impact on reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality in these cities.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to an improved quality of life for individuals. The German suburb of Vauban, for example, is a car-free community where residents have given up their cars in favor of alternative modes of transportation. This has resulted in reduced traffic noise, safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists, and a greater sense of community. Residents report feeling less stressed and happier as a result of not owning a car. Walking and cycling are not only healthier forms of transportation, but they also allow people to interact with their surroundings and each other in a way that driving does not.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. By reducing reliance on cars, we can prioritize and invest in public transportation systems, making them more accessible, efficient, and reliable. This can lead to cost savings for individuals, as they would no longer need to spend money on car ownership, maintenance, and fuel. Cities like Bogota have seen the positive economic impact of car-free days, as businesses such as bike-sharing and carpooling programs have emerged and flourished.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing reliance on cars, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance quality of life, and even stimulate economic growth. As demonstrated by various examples around the world, it is possible to create communities and cities that prioritize alternative modes of transportation and decrease dependency on cars. It is important that we continue to promote and adopt such initiatives to create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Smog. Gas. Pollution. Many countries dont allow for people to have cars because they destroy the air that they are breathing. People and animals become sick from there being an abundance of pollution in the air that they are breathing. Another factor that can be taken into consideration is that it can reduce the amount of traffic jams as well. Do you think that the community that you live is effected by the pollution from cars.

To start off, many districts are forbidding people have cars. In places near French and Swiss borders, citizens are forbidden from parking on streets, driveways, and home garages. Citizens say that they feel less tense and happier without having their car. Source 1 states that "" Vauban is separating suburban life from auto use as a component of ""smartplanning."" In Elisabeth Rosenthal's passage it says that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12%percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe..... and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States. In Europe forbidding car use it is drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Over the past couple of decades, maybe even centuries we have been centered around the automobile that has effected out health and daily lives because of the increase of pollution.

Also, the streets in Europe are not as crowded as the streets in the United States. Paris, more smog than any other European capital, has began to enforce a partial banning of cars to help clear the cities air. Cars that run off of diesel gas tend to create more pollution than cars that run off of regular gas. Sixtyfive percent% of France's vehicles are fueled with diesel gas. By limiting the usage of these cars they will be contributing to the decrease of gas in the air. The increase of pollution has created a solution to help and decrease polluted air by making plugin cars, hybrids, and cars that are able to transport more than one person at a time. Records and studies show that Beijing,China is one of the many polluted cities in the world.

Another fact that is an advantage of limited car usage is little to no traffic jams. In Colombian millions have began the day without cars where they use alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, skating, and riding buses. ""Day with out Cars"" has promoted the use of alternative forms of transportation and smog reduction. Since adults children and teens have reduced the limit of car usage the Mayor of Mockus has began the construction process of an 118 miles of bicycle paths, new parks, sidewalk, restaurants, and upscale shopping districts have been created for them to go to on their free time.

Many people have began to not be as interested in driving because gas prices, as well as pollution. Their are many advantages to not limiting the usage of the automobile. It has reduced the amount of money that we spend, pollution and much more is also has helped us notice that there are alternatives to driving a car such as walking, riding the bus, and bike riding. You are also able to interact more with friends because the topic of car pooling has became very important and noticable. Those are just a hand full of ideas and ways that limiting the usage of cars is effective.",0
"  A Sustainable Revolution in Urban Planning  In a world characterized by relentless urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a pioneering approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, prioritizing sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the key benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By emphasizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Furthermore, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College has been an election process in the united states sense the constitution was created. But it has come to the time where it no longer has a valuable position and is beginning to deteriorate. Over 60% of voters would prefer to only have a popular vote for Presidential elections, rather than the Electoral College. Recently it seems as if every election has been very tight and the winner of the popular votes loses due to the turn out of the electoral College votes. The electoral College system should be abolished and banned from our election process.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President rather than them directly voting themselves. Source 2 States ""The Electors can be anyone not holding office."" Therefore anybody can put herself in the position to be in the electoral College, even if they are unqualified for the responsibilities it requires. Also voters can't always control who their electors vote for so the efficiency of the election has already decreased.

This system allows for disaster. The electors could always defy the will of the people. Source 2 brings up ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" ""Faithless"" electors in the past have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they would like, and there is no guarantee that this will not occur again.

When it comes down to the core, the Electoral College does not provide an equal election to all voters. You will not find candidates dedicating their time in states where they believe they do not have a chance of winning. In effect, the representation and campaigning is not equally distributed throughout all the states. Some states may get no campaigning at all. Source 2 includes ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" All the focus is centered into the tight races of the ""swing"" states.

It is said that rarely will the electoral college voting come out as a tie but it has happend. In the situation of a tie the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, and the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

The Electoral College is out dated and irrelevant to our modern society and it is too indirect to present the true votes from our country. It is time to leave the vote to the people and only the people, and it is time for our country to mature and abolish the electoral College.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This has been observed in various countries around the world, as highlighted in the passages provided. By implementing measures to reduce car dependency, communities can achieve numerous benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to public transportation, and enhanced quality of life.

One of the greatest advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, both in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can make strides in combating climate change and improving the overall health of the environment.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a driving ban due to smog illustrates how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. By restricting car usage, communities can mitigate the impact of air pollution and create a healthier living environment for their residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can encourage the development of more compact and accessible communities. As described in the passage about Vauban, Germany, smart planning can involve placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation over private cars. This approach not only reduces the need for car usage but also fosters a sense of community and promotes a healthier lifestyle.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for increased accessibility to public transportation. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights how a car-free day can encourage alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit. By promoting these modes of transportation, communities can reduce congestion on the roads and make public transportation a more viable and convenient option for residents.

Finally, limiting car usage can contribute to an overall improved quality of life. The passage about Vauban, Germany, emphasizes how residents who have given up their cars feel happier and less stressed. This is supported by the passage about the decline in car ownership in the United States, which suggests that Americans are finding alternative ways to meet their transportation needs. By reducing car dependency, individuals can experience a greater sense of freedom and flexibility in their daily lives.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to public transportation, and an overall improved quality of life. By adopting measures to reduce car dependency, communities can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.",1
"Dear me.senator, My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn't because it's not fair for everyone. That is why i believe the Electoral college system should be no more.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" It's not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn't fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opportunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don't give them a chance.

""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidatesas we saw in 2012 election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states...Voters in the tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing they are going to decide the election."" Yes, the tossup states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the ""swing"" states. They are just as good as the people who want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because he lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!

So in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn't only get to be the electors decision on who gets to be President, but it also shouldn't be based off the more known states. Give other states, ""swing"" states, a chance too. That is why i say the electoral system should be no more.

Thank you for your time.",0
"I believe that we should change the system to ""election by popular vote"". If we were to change the way we elect our president im sure citizens would be more pleased with the over all outcome. People vote on who they think is best fit to represent them and give them the best over all outcome. When using the ""electoral college"" you are not voting for the president but you are voting for a state of electors. It would be easier to simply allow presidents to get the popular vote in order to make the election more fair all around. The ""electoral college"" is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. It is time to change our voting methods because the ""electoral college"" system is outdated, irrational, and unfair to citizens.

When people place their vote they believe they are putting in a vote for the president they choose, not for a slate of electors. The ""electoral college"" is a very nondemocratic way of selecting your president. In a way the government is deceiving their citizens by the way our voting method is set up. When people vote they feel a sense of independence because they are allowed to choose who they would like to represent them in congress. But instead once they place their vote it goes to electors rather than a simple vote towards the one they selected. If you were to change the way people's votes were counted it would be easier and faster to elect a president and get him into office to fix worldwide problems.

In all three articles at least one section has made it clear on their opinion to abolish the electoral college. Figures such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have agreed on abolishing the electoral college. When voting for president you are voting for a slate of electors, but do we even know who these supposed electors are! Are votes are being manipulated and we are not even aware of who is doing it. If we can not vote for are president without going through electors we should be able to vote for the electors who are voting for are president. It is only fair that we have some say in everything that is going on. When votes are being placed we should be informed of all that is going on.

If you were to vote for your favorite to show but your vote had to go through twenty different people all with different opinions you would be frustrated. Now imagine that scenario but with something extremely more significant than a television show, the president. You are trusting possibly the next four years of your life with strangers in which you have never heard of before. It would only be fair if we could simply change the system to popular vote rather than electoral college.

If you switch to popular vote more people would be more likely to vote because they could have more confidence about their vote. They would feel free to make their own decision and trust it would not be tampered with by a stranger. People deserve a fair vote and with the popular vote that is what you are giving them. Because every living being deserves equality. Changing the system would not only be helpful for citizens but helpful for the congress. Instead of having random members of congress choose the president they can work on serious issues around the world. They can stop worrying about foolishness and do their jobs.

In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I believe that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. So to end my argument I simply say think before you act and truly try to do whats right.",0
"Dear Florida State Senator, The Electoral College is an unamerican, and unfair voting process. In America we believe in the people living in our country having the right to vote for their leaders, but what if they're not directly voting themselves? The electoral college is an inaccurate way of determining the leaders of our country compared to the other actually accurate way of voting, a direct vote election. The method of The Electoral College cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. This doesn't seem exactly the way things are supposed to be in our nation since ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""source 2, does it?

Though it is highly unlikely that a choosen elector from a state would not vote towards the chosen side their state decided and voted upon, they still have the opportunity to. This opportunity is unfair to the voters of the state as they are not directly voting for the president, such as how things are in a direct vote. A direct vote allows the candidate to be choosen and voted for directly by voters knowladgebly voting, then the highest popularity percentage from votes are then to have the candidate be elected, not by a group of people that have a chance to be bias from the voters in their state. This problem can occur by things such as state legislatures picking electors that may not vote in favor of the states population's choice, but their and state legislatures choice. Even though ""...almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis,..""source 3 not all states electors must do so. They can and have the chance to choose whoever they want as the power to pick is in their hands, and out of ours.

In smaller states such as Hawaii and Alaska they are only given a total of 34 electoral college votes as their population is not as large as somewhere such as California, New York or Florida. This does not only matter due to the low number of votes awarded, but it also effects how much they may know about the candidates running for the position. A lot of candidates only choose to go to ""swing"" states California, New York, etc. in order to recieve more votes in the electoral college. ""...candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning,..""source 2 this causes a lot of people in areas not visited to be unknowledgable about eligible candidates in the voting process, and what they could be voting for. These ""swing"" states help candidates reach their goal of the winning 270 majority votes out of the 538 possible. 538 may seem like a large number but compared to the population of the United States its not really all that large of a group of people. The population of our nation and the votes of our voters is much more larger then the decisions of 538 electors.

Now hopefully it is clearer to see the many problems of the current electoral college system, as it is unfair and irrational. Our nation's voters are the ones who should be voting in a direct vote in picking the president compared to the electoral college. As the method of the electoral college cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. These are only a couple of the large problems caused by the electoral college.",0
"Throughout the decades of humans being on earth, we have evolved into a higher innovating society. We have designed technologies that ceased to exist one hundred years ago. Us humans designed ""touchscreen"" phones, the internet, and much more. throughout the decades we started advancing through technology and we keep perfecting every device andor engine on the planet. For example, a car is a major part of the human society. We use cars to get from place to place and we're always making new versions. If you look back during the 1930s1950s, cars weren't used as often we use them. If you were to look around, you would see families, men, and women walking alongside the road. During that time period, cars were not used constantly unless it was necessary. Presently, many people believe that humans should limit car usage. There are some countries that banned cars for a short time period. such as, Paris,France and Bogota, Columbia. There are also some areas that completely banned car usage forever. Take Vauban, Germany as an example they have decided that no one should use a car because it would be better for them. I second that motion We should most definitely limit car usage because it is better for the earth and we would be saving loads of money. Not to mention that limiting car usage IS safer.

Limiting car usage would be making a statement. Many people would never stop using their car, but what they are not considering is if we stop using cars, we would be helping the earth. Pollution has become so horrible throughout the year. Now that there are scientists and experts that are making new cars every day, we cause a lot more pollution then you know. Beijing, China is known as the most polluted city in the world. The people that live there have to wear a mask so they don't inhale the smog. Smog consists of smoke and fog from engines and exhaust I would think that people should take that to account because who wants to live in a world where you can't even breathe safely in? Instead of making more fueled engines, we should be making more electric powered engines, or ""hybrids"". There are a handful of Hybrid cars around, but they are insanely expensive.

Moreover, limiting car usage would save us money. Instead of paying gas fees of 70 dollars and up, we can just carpool, ride the bus, walk, or even ride a bike.

Although, If we do limit car usage, it would be a bad busnes for car dealerships like Ford, Honda, and much more. Saving money can go a long way in America. With all the money you save you could pay for college tuition, buy enough food for multiple families, or anything that you want depending how you save or spend the money.

Many people also believe that limiting car usage will help with stress and worries. People should take the time to walk to a closest friend's house and relish the nice oxygen that you breathe in. With the way it's looking now, we won't be breathing in oxygen for long, but mainly car emissions.

Furthermore, no cars equals safety. Many people pass away or becom seriously injured because of car accidents or getting hit by a car. If we do stop car usage , it would be safer to walk alongside the road and not be afraid of reckless drivers. There are people out there who won't even come out their house from fear of getting hit by a car or getting in an accident. There are many other safety precautions and dangers in the world, but limiting car usage could help a lot.

To conclude, every citizen across America should take account that fuel powered cars are a hazrd to the earth. Without fuel powered cars, we could do so much for the world and for ourselves. We would be saving money and we would be making the streets a safer place to be.",0
"Fresh clean air, spotless streets and no car accidents. Welcome to Vauban, Germany. The 5,500 people of this town are a part of something that this day and age has never seen. The residents here have given up their cars, and are a part of an experiment where their streets are completely ""carfree""!

After this experiment started in Germany, it's population would agree that the tenseness they were feeling with their cars is now gone. This new way of living was started in 2006 and other countries would agree that it is a smart move and an affordable way of living. The residents of Vauban have more money to spend on other necessities such as clothing and food, or maybe some entertainment, even. All of their monthly car payments and gasoline bills have ceased to exist because they simply have no reason to pay the prices anymore without a car. Citizens of this little town don't have to walk or ride their bikes far because the city has thought this movement out very well. All of the stores are placed just a walk away rather than their malls being placed on a distant highway. Public transportation has become more accessible and there is more space for sidewalks rather than roads. For some, this is a dream town for them and their children. There isn't much of a worry about air pollution or accidents.

If you were to compare vaughn's air pollution to being's the difference would be astounding. Just last night, NBC Nightly News showed the city of Bejing where the smog was so dense that visibility was reduced to almost none. The majority of the population won't go outside with out wearing a mask to protect them selves. All of the air pollutants could be harming us even with a potential risk of lung cancer. The mayor of Bejing has even made a statement talking about his city's air, and the risk and threat it poses to his residents. Even the common person will recognize that the gas emissions from a car's tail pipe equals pollution. Paris officials knew this too, and understood that their city had an air cleanliness issue. So, in an effort to make the City of Love more pleaseable they limited what cars could drive on what days. They enforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog in the city. For a short amount of time only evennumbered cars, for example, could drive on a Monday. If odd numbered cars were on the street then there would be a 22 Euro fine that equals 31 USD's. After 5 days, car traffic and conjestion was down around 60% on the streets, and the air pollution started clearing.

Fatal crashes are among the one of the third highest risks for all American's. Some states have even made it a law to not text and drive, and in some states there probably is a ""no talking on the cell phone law"" too! If the number of cars are reduced or taken away all together I feel that the lives of the American people are less at risk. Every day, and not just in this country, hundreds of people are injuring them selves or getting killed by distracted driving, hitandruns, and driving under the influence. It could be beneficial to cut down the car usage and up the number of public transportation avaible to the public.

In any major city you go to in the United States, all around you, you can notice the large amounts of people walking to where they need to go. In Washington D.C. bike rentals are EVERYWHERE. And if you don't want to take a bike then take the D.C. Metro. The same will go for New York City or anywhere with a large population of people. You will also notice that city folk tend to be slimmer than others. That is most likley due to the fact that they walk everywhere. Just like I mentioned before, like Vauban, eveything in a major city is usually within walking distance. As we all know, walking is a form of excersize and it is recomemnded by health officials that each person should get at least 1 hour every day and it is very believeable that a city goer gets plenty more than the recomended. The first lady has started a program for children in an effort to get them moving, fit and healthy as well. Some children in New York City won't even drive a single day in their lives or worry about what could happen if they do. Also, the Capital of ColombiaBogota has organized a day for it's residence to avoid taking their car. It is called the Day Without Cars and the major goal is to reduce smog and promote walking.

All in all.. Cars, the most dangerous driving force in our daily lives, should be cut back on. Even with study after study coming out and proving just how danger and nonbeneficial to our health they are, they are slowly losing populatiry. If this pattern stays consistant then sociologists say that it will have great effects on the atmosphere, and our healthy lives that we all live.",0
"Using a motor vehicle as a source of transportation is part of everyday life and is not rare to the stereotypical American. But cities such as Paris, Bogota, and Vauban are all striving towards reducing the rate of motor vehicle usage in their areas. Advantages of limiting car usage are lower greenhouse gas rates, suburbs can become more compact and more accessible to public transportation, and people are able to live less stressful lives.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the environment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the environment but unfortunately not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars.

Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of vaughn's family do not own cars and fiftyseven percent sold a car to move there. ""Smart planning"" is a component of the movement to separate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact environment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, ""Carfree day"" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.

Dropping off your kid at daycare, then driving to work, then having to drive your child to soccer practice can be a constant and stressful cycle for most parents. Residents of suburbs that have low car usage rates claim that they are less stressful. In a suburban community with little to no motor vehicle usage, the suburb will be more compact, having more stores and buildings closer to eachother at very short distances. This makes it easier for residents to get from point A to point B quicker and more efficiently. This also allows for more walking areas with less traffic and dangerous cars to worry about.

Cars can be useful in many ways but for the better of the enviorment, peoples cities, and sanity, little to no car use is the way to go.",0
"Limiting car usage has a range of advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in the examples of the car-free community in Germany, the driving ban in Paris to reduce smog, and the car-free day in Bogota. These initiatives show the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on the environment, public health, and urban planning.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to pollution, particularly in dense urban areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can be as high as 50% (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In Paris, a driving ban was enforced due to smog, and congestion decreased by 60% as a result (Duffer). Similarly, Bogota implemented a car-free day to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation methods (Selsky). These initiatives show that limiting car usage can have a direct impact on air quality and create a healthier environment for residents.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to improve urban planning and create more sustainable communities. In the car-free community in Germany, streets are designed for pedestrians and cyclists rather than cars (Rosenthal). This approach makes it easier for residents to walk or cycle to their destinations and promotes a sense of community and social interaction. Additionally, limiting car usage allows for more space for public transportation and other forms of sustainable transportation, making it easier for individuals to access essential services without relying on cars.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In Paris, delivery companies experienced lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for cars carrying three or more passengers (Duffer). This shows that by promoting carpooling and shared transportation services, we can reduce congestion and make more efficient use of our transportation infrastructure.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of advantages such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, enhancing urban planning, and creating more sustainable communities. The examples of the car-free community in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota demonstrate the positive impact that these initiatives can have. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative transportation methods, we can create a healthier, more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.",1
"Imagine that it's 6:00am, Monday 2026 and you wake up to the smell of gasoline, fuel, and fogged air you look outside and all you see is car after car commuting to one's everyday life and spreading pollution every where. Cars are used way to often by many people who don't even need it most the time. If you do your part and limit car usage only good things will come to the world. Limiting car usage in today's environment sounds like a difficult thing to do since people work, go to school, etc. but in reality limiting car usage is saving the environment around us and by saving the environment you are saving yourself.

The high number of car usage is polluting our environment in numerous ways due to the smog it creates that corrupts the air. Sometimes it takes seeing what one is doing to stop and think about how they are affecting it. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Source 2, Paragraph 10"". You can see that because of the increased pollution in Paris they putforth a law to limit the car usage in the city. If you limit usage than progress in the environment will occur. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog Source 2, Paragraph 14"". In only ""fivedays"" more than half of congested pollution decreased due to the limiting of car usage in that area. Cars can just destroy the atmosphere but we as people can make a big change by just walking or riding a bike in the times where you don't need a car and just doing that is a great way to decrease pollution by limiting your car usage.

Some places and people in the world seem to thrive without cars in their everyday system. People who don't own cars seem to have less stress in their life. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way... Source 1, Paragraph 3"". In some areas of the world the government has days to support the limiting of car usage by banning them for a temporary time. ""BOGOTA, Colombia In a program... millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took busses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Source 3, Paragraph 20"". Having a day free of cars has a great chance of decreasing some of the modern stresses of life. Living a life without cars even if it is for a certain period of time is helpful in reducing the pressure on ones' life and gives nature a fighting chance on this planet.

Limiting car usage is beneficial to world whether the impact is small or large it all plays a good part in protecting our health and the environment around us. People have made changes some take to the extreme others don't do something about it until they see for themselves what it does. If one limits their car usage then they are being a great benefactor and get to experience the advantages of it. You stop imagining and now you think ""I'm going to ride my bike to school today"".",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly evident, as demonstrated by various communities and cities around the world. These areas have implemented car-reduction strategies and are reaping the benefits in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life.

One example of a car-free community is Vauban in Germany. In this experimental district, car ownership is allowed but parking is limited. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. Residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is being adopted in other parts of Europe, the United States, and the developing world.

The impact of cars on the environment is a significant concern. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the figure can reach up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can contribute to reducing these emissions and combatting climate change.

Creating car-free areas also promotes smart planning and compact, accessible communities. Instead of relying on cars, these areas focus on public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. The placement of stores along main streets encourages walking rather than driving to access daily necessities. This shift in urban planning is crucial for reducing dependence on cars and encouraging sustainable alternatives.

Cities around the world are taking steps to limit car usage. Paris, for example, enforced a partial driving ban during periods of intense smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion in the city. While the ban inconvenienced some delivery companies, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers. The success of this initiative highlights the potential benefits of limiting car usage during times of high pollution.

Car-free days are another effective way to promote alternative transportation and reduce air pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets empty of traffic jams. This event is part of a broader improvement campaign in Bogota, which has seen the construction of extensive bicycle paths and the transformation of the cityscape to enhance walkability.

A shift in American behavior is also contributing to the reduction in car usage. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. Factors such as the availability of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, and the rise of carpooling apps have contributed to this cultural change. If this trend continues, it will have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. Communities that have implemented car-reduction strategies have experienced improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and enhanced quality of life. By prioritizing public transportation, pedestrian infrastructure, and alternative forms of transportation, cities can create more sustainable and livable environments. The shift towards limiting car usage is not only happening in developed countries but also in the developing world. It is a global movement that can contribute to combating climate change and improving the well-being of citizens.",1
"Every vote makes a difference. Every single vote plays a role in electing a president, whether it be directly, or indirectly. The Electoral College has caused a lot of controversy with that thought. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Plumer 14 Where are the facts behind the argument against it? We all hear people complaining and saying these things, but they have no facts as to why abolishing the Electoral College would be beneficial. The Electoral College is working in the peoples favor and i believe we should keep it.

There are so many uneducated voters. People that vote for the presidential candidate at the top of the list because they have no clue who any of the people are anyway. If the president was selected by just popular votes who knows what the nation would be like. Every vote counts. Yes, this is true even with Electoral College it just a process to make sure that the votes being sent in are educated and well thought out not chosen out of laziness. Do we want the people who vote just to say they voted to have a huge say in who runs our country? I sure don't. I'd rather have a trusted group of people who are very well educated take our votes into huge consideration and seal the deal. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed..."" Posner 16. Richard A. Posner goes on to tell us how many times the trust has been betrayed... the most recent being in the election year 2000 and then the only other time the electoral vote did not reflect the popular vote was 1888. There's no reason to change a system that isn't broken.

Obviously the system has its flaws, but nothing is perfect. Sure the Electoral College messed up twice, but that isn't some mass amount that was detrimental to our nation. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Office of the Federal Register 1 It's a compromise that has worked for so long there's not enough valid reasons to change it.

The Electoral College gives the right amount of representation to different sized states. ""The Popular vote was very close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes."" Posner 21 The majority of the state was in favor of Obams's ideas so 29 Electoral votes would work in their states favor, instead of having an almost tie vote which would make a smaller difference in the outcome. The Electoral College votes are like each states individual votes for the candidate that would make the majority of that one state happy, or that would benefit that one state. So yes, the popular vote may not always win, but the outcome of the presidential election is based on which person was the favorite of the majority of each individual state.

All in all, the Electoral College works for this nation. It worked for our founding fathers and it's still working for us, no matter what people want to argue. If ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Plumer 9 then the majority of our country should be able to come up with a valid argument against it.",0
"Cars have always seemed to be a necessity to people, but did you know just how bad cars can be? There are plenty of other modes of transportation you could choose from besides a car. Limiting car usage has plenty of advantages!

One advantage to limiting car usage is it improves safety. Safety in a community is what we all strive for and by taking this step, we can improve people's safety immensely. By having less cars on the road, there is a lesser chance for fatal accidents to occur. As well, you will improve your own safety by not getting into a car as much. It will lower your chance of getting into a fatal accident yourself. If you choose an alternate mode to transportation, you may also just increase your mood. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article of ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", a man named Heidrun Walter said that ""when I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way without a car to drive. Driving can lead to a negative mood, but mix that with danger and the results could get terrible.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is by not using your car, you can save money. Let's face it, cars are an expensive thing to keep running. It costs you money each time you go to refill your gas, costs money every time you have to go in to see a mechanic, it costs money to wash your car, and don't forget about buying the car or a new one if your current one has too many problems. Now with that in mind, just think about how much money one can save by not using the car as often as one does now. By not using your car, you can save yourself money and time.

More importantly, by limiting your car usage you can help reduce the emission into our atmosphere. As said in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article the End of Car Culture', ""transportation is the second largests source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"". By using a car daily, we emit a massive amount of carbon and other terrible gases into the atmosphere. Mixing those elements into our atmosphere can lead to smog and a destroyed atmosphere. Paris had to ban car usage for a few days just to clear out the global air arund them due to days of nearrecord pollution. We can save our environment, just by going the extra mile and choosing a different mode of transportation.

By limiting car usage in our communities, it can lead to a healthier, happier, and safer community as well as a money saver for all of us. It's understandable when you are to go a lengthy distance to use a car. Daily travels are usually close by, maybe try walking or taking the bus to your location. You may never know just how much you may like using that mode of transportation rather than driving your own car.",0
"Have you ever walked outside and taken a deep breath of fresh air but then you realise that the air your breathing isnt alll that fresh? Thats because air pollution has greatly increased in recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increased dramtically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an auto mobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. while cars have made it easier for our day to day lives the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change.

The fact that the amount of pollution is ever increasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving every time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convenient you could make a difference in the world. You dont have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. the world is facing an epidemic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun.

Not only is limiting your car usage better for the environment it is also better for your body. When you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times through out the day. thiss can also give you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go.

When you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the environment and you as a person. limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out.

In conclusion the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to live.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my opinion regarding the current debate surrounding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained, and I would like to present several reasons to support my stance.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certain degree of certainty in the outcome of the presidential election. While disputes over the popular vote can and have occurred, such conflicts are less likely in the case of the Electoral College. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. With the majority of states using a winner-takes-all system, the chances of a nationwide tie in the Electoral College votes are highly unlikely.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents a situation where one particular region has enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president. This system ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. It encourages candidates to campaign in a wide range of states, making them accountable to the concerns and needs of citizens across the country.

In addition, the Electoral College system emphasizes the significance of swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are able to directly engage with voters who hold considerable influence in deciding the election. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as citizens in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and critically evaluate the competing candidates. The ability of swing states to determine the outcome prevents the presidency from being determined by a few densely populated areas while disregarding the concerns of citizens in other parts of the country.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. The differential allocation of electoral votes based on population gives larger states a greater say in the election process. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the needs of smaller, less populous states at the expense of larger ones. The Electoral College system recognizes that a state's size should be taken into account when considering its influence on the national level.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. Since the winning candidate must secure a majority of electoral votes, the system guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and potential division that would arise from additional rounds of voting if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can disenfranchise voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to remember that individuals who vote in presidential elections typically do so to express their political preferences. The fact that not every vote swings a national election does not diminish the significance of individual citizens participating in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system and should be maintained. It provides certainty in the outcome of the election, ensures representation and unity across regions, promotes informed voting through swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. The Electoral College system may not be perfect, but it strikes a balance that preserves the integrity of our national elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make decisions that best serve the interests of our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

"Cars have always been used to get from point A to point B. That is how the people in society know what cars are for. However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world.

Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic sometimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic.

Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. siva even claims that ""A car is just a means of getting from A to B..."" Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, ""...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..."" When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic.

There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of.

Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late. Limiting car usage is a way that everyone can explore the world than being stuck in that four or tw door car. Limiting car usage has its downs but it also have its perks.",0
"Does the Electoral College work? Are you happy with a group of electors choosing your president? I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win,and it could be ""disaster factor"". Many are familiar with this term: ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens""What Is the Electoral College?,1, but how does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Lets go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The majority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Bush had more electors on his side than Gore. Nobody understood why, they gave the country the president less wanted. despite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, because it happened once and for sure it could happen again, Why did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: ""This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc. the government takes care of the people, like it they were our parents."" I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system alloys for much worse""Plumer,1. This quote is based on 1960,when people who favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones who would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against their original choice, the party's candidate. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors""Posner,1.

Another reason why this system should be abolished is the winnertakeall system. The candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plumer says in a expert from ""Mother Jones"" that ""During the 2000 campaing , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and Soth California, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add."" The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs and the beliefs of hundreds is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster and it can choose the candidate the public is not haoory with. The votes are people who want to express, or show, political preferences, people who are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it. ""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" Plumer,1.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards reducing reliance on cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation. This trend is supported by evidence from various sources, including articles such as ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, and ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. 

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution (Rosenthal). According to the article, car emissions account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive effects on people's overall well-being and quality of life. In the article about the German suburb, Vauban, residents expressed how giving up their cars has made them happier and less stressed (Rosenthal). The reliance on cars can lead to congestion, long commutes, and increased stress levels. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, people can have shorter and more enjoyable commutes. This can lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle, as walking and biking provide opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities.

Furthermore, reducing car usage can have economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to address the issue of smog, and the congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent (Duffer). This shows that limiting car usage can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, which in turn can lead to time and cost savings for individuals and businesses. Additionally, by encouraging alternative modes of transportation, cities can reduce the need for extensive car infrastructure and parking spaces, freeing up valuable land for other purposes (Rosenthal).

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve people's well-being, promote a healthier lifestyle, and have economic benefits. As demonstrated by examples from Germany, Paris, and Bogota, adopting smart planning strategies and promoting alternative modes of transportation can lead to successful and sustainable communities. It is important for citizens and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies and initiatives that support this shift.",1

Subject: The Benefits of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the advantages it provides in determining the President of the United States. Although there are arguments in favor of moving towards a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our constitutional process and should be retained. This letter presents multiple reasons for keeping the Electoral College, based on the information provided in the accompanying passage text from the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner's defense of the Electoral College.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the 2012 presidential election, Barack Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only had a 51.3% share of the popular vote. This system guarantees a clear winner and minimizes the likelihood of disputes over the outcome. Furthermore, with almost all states following a winner-take-all approach, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This promotes stability and avoids the need for run-off elections, as seen in the cases of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. A presidential candidate must have trans-regional appeal as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure victory. This ensures that candidates focus on the needs and concerns of a diverse range of states, rather than solely targeting the most populous areas. Additionally, swing states gain prominence in the electoral process, encouraging candidates to address the issues specific to those states. This fosters engagement from voters in those states and helps emphasize their importance in the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states. Although the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states an advantage in terms of representation, the Electoral College allows larger states to have more weight in the electoral process. Due to the winner-take-all method, a victory in a large state, such as Florida, carries significantly more electoral votes than a victory in a smaller state, such as Wyoming. This prevents smaller states from being overlooked and ensures that candidates address the concerns of a wide range of voters across different states.

Lastly, the Electoral College system entices voters to engage in the political process. While critics argue that supporters of candidates who are unlikely to win their state may lose motivation to vote, the truth is that voters participate in elections to express their political preferences, not with the expectation that their vote will decide the outcome. In the 2012 election, nearly half of the eligible American population voted, further exemplifying the commitment of voters to the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system. It provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for all regions, promotes engagement with swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there are calls to shift towards a popular vote system, it is essential to consider the benefits and stability provided by the Electoral College. I strongly urge you to vote in favor of preserving this system for the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"The Electoral College is a process that has been used in the United States Government for many years. It is the process that selects a candidate for Presidency based on electoral votes rather than the popular vote of the people. Many believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, but if we were to take it out of our governmental system, it would take away most of the effectiveness of our elections. The United States election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process of election, it is very effective for choosing a candidate, and when it comes down to it, the last process of the Electoral College House of Representatives stepping in when there is a tie is very unbiased and is also effective in choosing a candidate. If we were to abolish the Electoral College, the United States government would basically be starting over with their election process, which isn't necessarily a good idea once you are nearly 300 years into being an official country.

The United states election process has worked very effectively with the Electoral College for a large amount of years. There is no reason why it should be abolished from the country. Throughout all of these elections, the best candidate was chosen for each presidency in the end because of this great process of election. Rather than choosing the majority of the people, which could have a biased opinion, it is left up to both the citizens and a vote in Congress. This forms a balance between the two opinions. It is a very evenly based system, as said in Source 3 ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our deprived methods of choosing the President"", the article states that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This means that just by having one region of the United States really respect you and vote for you, this does not mean you are going to win the election. No region can get you the win. There simply are not enough electoral votes. Therefore, you must cover the most ground possible in the United States, because the more states you win over, the better your chances of becoming president are.

The Electoral College is a very efficient process of election. Instead of only the people voting and the decision of who becomes president left to the popular vote, the power of selection for presidency is evenly spread between Congress and the people. Some say that the electoral college is unfair, and that it is irrational. This is stated in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer. He states ""The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" This means Plumer believes that those who argue in favor of the electoral collegee do not take a look at the reality of things when talking about this subject. The electoral collegee is very fair when it comes to the election of a president, because we all want to choose the best candidate for the job, and the only way to do that is to have an effective system for choosing a candidate without having a biased opinion tossed into the mix to mess up the process. It's sort of like a job interview. You show what you have to offer to the boss in this case it is the whole country, and if you are chosen for the job that means you were the most qualified and that you are the best choice for the job. Whichever candidate gets chosen for the job was obviously the best candidate at the time, and there is nothing that anyone can do to change that.

The one situation that most people worry about within the electoral collegee is when there is a tie in the electoral vote. In this situation, the decision of the election would be placed into the hands of the House of Representatives and the Senate chooses the VicePresidential candidate best suited for the job. It does not matter how many representatives there are for any one state, as stated in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. He states that ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, representing 35 million voters."" This means that no state has more power than another in this process, and every representative has the same amount of power when it comes down to chooosing a candidate best suited for being president. Additionally, it creates a sense of balance between all of the states and nobody has an unfair advantage when electing the next president.

As you can see, the electoral collegee is a very effective process used in the United States to choose a presidential candidate that should not be abolished from the country. With this system, the country has functioned very effectively for a very long time, the system is very effective for choosing a candidate best suited for the presidential position, and it is very unbiased and fair when it comes down to the decision of the House of Representatives for the election. Abolishing this efficient process would just do a disservice to the country's election process, and I highly doubt that any wholehearted citizen of the United States of America would want to do that to his or her own home country.",0

Subject: Supporting the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the importance of retaining this system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to the popular vote system, there are compelling reasons to maintain the current process.

One of the primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As demonstrated in the 2012 election, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This results in a clear and decisive victory, reducing the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome. In our current divisive political climate, it is necessary to have a system that ensures a smooth transfer of power and avoids prolonged uncertainty.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" This system requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no region by itself has enough electoral votes to elect a president. By campaigning in different regions and appealing to a wide range of voters, candidates are encouraged to consider the interests of all Americans. This prevents any one region from feeling disenfranchised and promotes national unity.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is the significance it gives to swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states, where the outcome is unpredictable. This ensures that voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. It is important that the election is decided by those who have carefully considered the candidates' policies and proposals.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores the weight of large states in the political balance, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate as decreed by the Constitution. This avoids a situation where candidates primarily cater to the interests of smaller states, neglecting the needs of the majority. By providing large states with more attention during campaigns, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of diverse interests across the nation.

Lastly, the Electoral College safeguards against the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College system invariably produces a clear winner. This prevents the complexity and cost that would be associated with run-off elections, allowing for a more efficient and decisive election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a time-honored process that strikes a balance between the interests of smaller states and those of the nation as a whole. It strengthens our democracy by promoting national unity, ensuring the certainty of outcome, and recognizing the importance of swing states. I urge you to carefully consider these points and to continue supporting the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and attention. I trust that you will make the best decision for the future of our nation. If you require any additional information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

"After World War II cars began to become more and more popular, and ever since then they cars have done more harm than good, air pollution, traffic and just harming health are a few things cars have harmed citizens with. Many cities are doing things to help cut down the ""smog"" in their area by creating driving bans for a day or even a week Paris bans driving due to smog 10 PBDS. It starts with one and grows into something much larger, and hopefully that shows in this situation. This essay is going to go into detail on why it is needed to cut back on car usage and maybe one day cars will not be needed.

People began pointing the finger at diesels for the air pollution in France after it was made obvious that they make up 67% of the vehicles in this area, compared to around 50% in the other parts of Western Europe PBDS 16. Greenhouse gasses are harming our atmosphere by trapping the warm air in. If the habits of this generation continue than Earth will not be here much longer. A very popular vehicle, passenger cars, make up to 50% of the greenhouse gasses in some of the busy areas in the US. People are all about convenience, and cars do much of that instead of riding a bike for 30 minutes we can drive there in five without breaking a sweat. But it is time to break those running shoes out because our planet is dying. If everyone realized the reality behind greenhouse gassesand the pollution we are putting into the air, we would not be in this situation.

In Paris they needed to cut back on the pollution, so they took action by having a day where motorists with even numbered license plates could drive and the next day, oddnumbers. After almost a week the smog had cleared and everyone was back on the road again. But during this time period it was recorded that the congestion was down 60% in the capital of France alone PBDS 14. If everyday was like this, traveling to and from places would be easier and less time consuming. Although it was not much it starts with a little and grows to a lot. New York has a new bike program which adds up to much less if you count in the amount of tolls and gas they motorists do from day to day The End of Car Culture 37 ECC. People are begginning to notice the benefits of riding your bike to work rather than driving, you are saving money and the Earth.

Health is important to us and the future. This Earth is running out of clean air between pollution and deforistation when will it stop. The chairman for Ford Motor Company is creating a plan in which ""pedestirans, bicycles, private cars, commercialand public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" ECC 43. If all car producers were as aware as Bill Ford they could join together to make this world healthier and cleanier. But will it be enough, but by limiting cars usage all together our atmosphere could grow back to the potential it should be at, not trapping the warm air in.

After Bogota had their car free day, sidewalks were replaced and parks were packed. Almost everyone participated with either hiking, biking, skating or taking the bus. The goal, which they succeeded with was to reduce their smog Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota 28. What if all the countries did as so, it could start as a day, and grow into a week, a month, maybe forever. It would help us, our health and the future that has yet to come. After reading this essay it is obvious to why limiting car usage is essential to life. It has grown into something no one could have imagined and now that it is here, when will it be enough.",0
"Could you imagine what it would be like if we limited the usage of cars? We could save money on gas, who doesn't love saving money?! More money in our pockets means buying more items that are useful to us. And muse about how much pollution would decrease! We could all breathe in sublime air, clean air! Instead of huge car garages and parking lots we could save a lot of room, and use that room to build cheap houses for people in need.

Gas prices are hefty these days. They used to be a whopping 5 cents! Now they are around 2.90 almost three dollars! Could you even imagine how much money you would save a month? If you pay for 5 gallons of gas everyweek you would be saving around 60 a month! You could go out, buy extra groceries, have fun with it! I remember back in 2014 gasoline prices waged to 5 in some counties. Me and my father had to walk to our favorite stores, but it turns out that we very well like the sun beating on our skin, so we usually walk, and we rarely use our car unless we travel far distances.

Pollution will always be a big problem on Earth. We may not have cars, but we still have ships, and guess what? They can cause pollution, too! It would be so much better and healthier! if we all could breathe fresh air. If pollution were are main problem, ""plug in cars, and hybrids would be an exception"", as quoted in Paris bans driving due to smog.

Whew, I'm sweating thinking about how much excessive you could get if there were a limited usage of our cars! Everyone uses their phones, and sits on the couch all day long. How boring! You could go outside with your friends, walk to the mall, or walk to a store. Most of our daily life would be revolved around if we could move our feet. I walk to and from school, and I enjoy it, although the nasty gasoline smell and strange puff of smoke that comes out of the car I do not, and Heidrun Walter is with me. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , Walter states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way after she sold her car."" Being carfree wouldn't be so bad after all! Thanks to technology, we can breathe cleaner air because of hybrids and plugin cars. Pollution is deadly, I know no one wants to die this way, especially if it can be solved. Carfree? No problems.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can greatly benefit individuals and society as a whole. This concept is becoming increasingly popular around the world, as seen in examples like the German suburb of Vauban, the driving bans in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and create more sustainable and livable communities.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, they account for up to 50 percent. By relying less on cars, we can decrease our carbon footprint and combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality, as demonstrated by the driving bans in Paris. Smog and pollution from cars can have a detrimental impact on human health, causing respiratory problems and other illnesses. By implementing measures to reduce car usage, we can decrease these health risks and create cleaner and healthier environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. With fewer cars on the road, traffic flow can improve, leading to shorter commute times and less frustration for commuters. This is especially evident in car-free communities like Vauban, where residents have embraced alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit. By providing better infrastructure and accessibility to these modes of transportation, we can encourage people to leave their cars at home and avoid the gridlock that plagues many cities.

In addition, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting the principles of smart planning, as seen in Vauban, we can create neighborhoods that prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation rather than cars. Stores placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls, promote a sense of community and reduce the need for excessive car usage. This approach not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also reduces the dependence on cars, making these communities more environmentally friendly.

Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are clear. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, and creating sustainable communities, we can mitigate the negative impact of cars and move towards a more environmentally friendly and socially responsible future. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace the advantages of limiting car usage and work together to create a more sustainable and livable world.",1
"  A Sustainable Urban Future  Car-free cities are emerging as a powerful response to the pressing challenges of urbanization. These cities aspire to create environments where private automobiles are either severely restricted or completely banned, emphasizing sustainable transportation alternatives, cleaner air, and vibrant urban living. This essay delves into the concept of car-free cities, exploring their potential benefits, challenges, and solutions.  Car-free cities are gaining momentum as a solution to pressing urban challenges. These cities aim to create environments where private automobiles are either restricted or entirely eliminated in favor of sustainable transportation alternatives. This essay explores the concept of car-free cities, emphasizing their potential benefits, challenges, and solutions.  Car-free cities represent a vision for urban living that emphasizes sustainability, health, and efficiency:  Environmental Sustainability: A reduced reliance on cars leads to decreased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This shift towards environmental sustainability helps mitigate climate change and promotes cleaner, healthier cities.  Public Health: Car-free cities create safer environments for pedestrians and cyclists. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular health, enhancing overall public well-being.  Optimal Space Utilization: Car-free cities make efficient use of urban space. Parking lots and wide roads can be repurposed into green spaces, parks, and pedestrian zones, enhancing the quality of life.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: Fewer private cars on the road result in less traffic congestion, shorter commutes, and lower stress levels for city residents and commuters.  Economic Savings: Car ownership can be expensive, including vehicle purchase, fuel, and insurance. Car-free cities offer residents an opportunity to save money and improve their financial stability.  Despite their potential, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on cars for daily activities and commutes. The shift to car-free living can face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a loss of personal autonomy.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: A robust public transportation system is vital for the success of car-free cities. Investments in public transit and its expansion are crucial to provide convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience revenue declines during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is essential.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: Redesigning urban areas for car-free living requires comprehensive planning and substantial infrastructure investments, which can be complex and time-consuming.  Solutions for the successful adoption of car-free cities include expanding public transportation networks, promoting active transportation such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities present a promising vision for a more sustainable and healthy urban future. While they come with challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling objective. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and involving the public in the planning process, cities can work towards a future where private cars no longer dominate the urban landscape. Car-free cities offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and vibrant urban environment.",1
"Do you own a car? Have you ever driven one? Many people would answer yes to these questions, and would agree that cars , in fact, are very useful. But have you ever thought of the advantages that would occur if we limited car usage? While cars are very useful, they also have lots of negative side affects that come along with it. Cars accumulate lots of pollution in the environment and stress to humans. Also less cars, results in less traffic, which means you will be wasting less of you're life waiting to get somewhere and actually being there in the moment. Whether you realize it or not Americans are already starting to cut down on car usage. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it even states ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" The world has been struggling with pollution for quite some time now and has been trying to come up with ways to cut it down. So why not start with where it derives from the most? Cars. Pollution by cars got so bad in Paris that they had to use license plate numbers to decide what cars could drive on certain days! But what did happen was ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog."" Duffer. That is amazing! Just five days of less car usage and the smog went down 60 percent. Pollution would drop in great percentages if we just cut down car usage a bit. Pollution will always be harmful to the world, but steps should be taken to harm the world as little as possible.

Stress is something everyone experiences, but it is safe to say that everyone could do with less of it. Cars cause lots of stress to humans. A city in Germany does not allow cars and a women from the city says ""When I had a car I was always tense."" Rosenthal. She is much more relaxed now and does not need to worry about all the stress that comes along with owning a car. Another person from Bogota, Columbia, where they have a carfree day, says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Selsky. People all around the world are reporting that their lives are a lot less stress free when they do not own cars. Stress is something that can be very damaging to a human when in large amounts and just cutting down on driving takes away lots of that stress.

Everyone has been stuck in traffic from time to time, and for some people in small cities, five minutes could be a long time to be stuck in traffic. But for some people in big cities like New York City and Los Angelos, people waste hours stuck in traffic! When you accumulate all those hours stuck in traffic, that is a lot of your time wasted in just waiting to get from desitination A, to destination B. Those hours could be spent on actually being there in the moment at the destination you want to be at. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009....."" Rosenthal, many people nowadays just want to get to the place that they are going to, as fast as possible whether that be by carpooling, taking the bus, or biking. Car usage is already decreasing, but that advantage should be taken that people want to live in the moment more and car usage should be even more cut down.

Car usage may never be completely taken away, but it defintley can be lowered. The advantages and benefits of just less car usage is astonishing. Less pollution to help the world, less stress to help the people, and letting people live life in the moment more are all advantages the derive from cutting down on the usage of cars. It may be diffcult to let go of something many people hold on to so dearest, but it is a change the will benefit us. While cars may have its pros, its cons outweigh it in the end.",0
"""No one cares about the environment."" said no one ever. The environment we live in, wether its a crowded city like NewYork, or Paris, or even a regular suburban community, is a wonderful place. There is one issue though that has spread among communities, and that is the high amount of car usage. Having a car and being able to track to great distances in a short amount of time is great, but look at what cars do to the environment. Also when it comes to buying a car, you're basically throwing your bank account out the window. And dont get me started with the worries of having your children play in the streets.

Now, lets discuss the crazy amount of money you have to throw away on a car. You either throw away a fortune on a good car, that runs good, and then end up taking years to pay it off, or you buy a cheap, beat up car, that is always in need of repair. Either way it is a lose, lose situation. Why buy these insanely priced cars when you can buy a nice bike that moves perfectly. At around five hundred dollars, to a thousand dollars a bike is easily the way to go. A bonus to buying a nice bike instead of a car, is that while you ride your bike, you'll get into shape in no time at all. Now if you need to track a great distance that riding a bike can not get you to fast enough, buses or mobile transport have bike racks on them so you can ride a bus to the nearest position to where you need to be then simply ride your bike for the remainder of the distance.

The main issue here with cars for most people, is that there is a large amount of pollution that comes with driving a car. In Paris the pollution from cars were so bad that Paris had to put a temporary ban on driving to help clear out all of the smog that was in the sky. Also, in America car pollution is the second largest source of pollution emissions. There is no other way to say it, cars make up a lot of the earths pollution, and when the time comes that people start to die down on using cars the world will be a much healthier place to be in.

Now you can not tell me that there is not at least one parent who will read this next statement and not agree more. Less cars, safer streets. Every mom, dad, brother, sister, or any kind of other relative have worried about their family playing in the streets. There are millions of accidents every year in the world that result in people getting hit by cars and killed, or seriously injured. With less cars on the streets the world will be a much safer place for kids, and even adults, as there is drunk drivers you have to look out for, or reckless drivers who dont even have a license.

All together limiting car usage will have multiple benefits to the world, and even your own community. One being you dont have to pay for a car when they start going out of style, another being the worlds pollution will lower at a huge rate, and last that the roads we live, and breathe on will be a much safer place. Limit your car usage and make the word a better place on step at a time.",0
"Cars are used everyday to get from one place to another. In some places, people depend on cars more than others that live in different parts of the world. However, the reduction of car usage has many advantages the planet would greatly benefit from less pollution, traffic jams would not be as frequent, and people become more healthy as a result.

Limiting the use of cars would greatly help the problem of pollution in the world today. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, she describes what affects cars have on pollution, ""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middleclass families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United states"" Rosenthal. One can clearly see that cars are a major factor in the pollution dilemma that so many people are trying to resolve. Everyone can take a part in the resolution of reducing pollution by depending less on cars and using other modes of transport such as public transportation, biking, or even walking. Some cities are placing enforcements to ban the usage of cars. Paris is an example of one of these locations. The result of the enforcement was that congestion or smog went down 60 percent. This is a great improvement for the city, which is known for having nearrecord pollution. Multiplying these enforcements to other cities would definitely bring down a large percent of the pollution found on Earth. This is benefiting not only the planet, but also the population that lives on the planet by enabling them to breathe healthier air.

The cause of traffic jams is the abundant amount of cars on the road, which could be avoided if less cars were used. Andrew Selsky wrote in his article, Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky. With no cars to clog the streets, a relaxed sentiment took the place of a usually anxious and hurried feeling. Rushhour restrictions were put in act, and have drastically cut traffic. Less honking takes place, and more time is saved in order to get to one's destination. Cars are not always needed to get someone where they want to go, and the enviornment is less stressul without all of the congestion of cars on the road.

People become more healthy when car usage is limited. Instead of taking a car to get from point A to point B, some people are walking or biking instead. This is a huge benefit to the people that are exercising. Also, in Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota, it says that parks and sports centers have bloomed throuhout the city of Bogota because of the decreased usage of automobiles. The parks and sport centers help people stay active and healthy.

Although cars are useful in order to get to one's destination, there are many advantages to cutting back the usage of them. A huge advantage is that pollution would drastically go down. Another is the time and stress saved from less traffic jams. Lastly, people would benefit from the way they are making their lives more healthy.",0
"Dear Florida's state senator, Everyone, whether old, young, tall, or short, have an opinion. In America, we have many amendments protecting us so we can share our opinions with whomever we want. However, the electoral college is flat out taking away our right to share our thoughts about the future leaders of the nation. The electoral college is irrational, and unfair.

The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. For example, there are 55 representatives in California to represent 35 million voters. As you can see, it is an unfair ratio. It is impossible for the House's votes to reflect the views of the people in California. That also means that since each state only has one fianl vote, a state such as Wyoming, who has 500,000 voters, would have as much say as California, with 35 million. California has more people, and my making every state have equal representation, it is messing up representation in states like California.

In the system we have today, it is very easy to have a deadlocked election. In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college creates an unfair system to gaining votes. In 2000, 17 states, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, who are home to some of the largest media markets, didn't even get the chance to see a campaign ad. If you were a candidate, wouldn't you want your ad to be seen in the some of the largest media markets? The candidates had already thought they won those states, which is a ignorant move to make. Because of the electoral college, and the unspoken rules that have been set in place about certain states views, the candidates missed a greatly helpful opprotunity to gain more votes.

However, many might think that the electoral college is a good system because it gives a clear winner, and it makes the states have equal representation. If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. The people want to have a say, not someone choosing for them.

The electoal college may have been a good idea back when it was first created, however, times are changing and the number of people being able to vote is growing day by day. The voters want to give their opinion through voting, and by having the electoral college in place, it is making voting unfair, irrational, and nearly impossible to do.

Thank you for your time.",0
"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone would have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about safety because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce lot of problems we have, and stress.

To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amount of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.

Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amount of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be lot safer for people to drive. Sadly in lot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 34 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amount of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amount of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.

We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 1020 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.

To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce lot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned lot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.",0
"In 2000 when Al Gore got more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide he did not win the election. It is because of the corrupt prosses of the Electoral College that he did not gain presidency. It is this among other things we must do away with the Electoral colleges we want to run a true democracy.

There are many people who would argue that the electoral College should stay and be apart of how we elect our president. Richard A. Posner author of Defence of the Electoral College claims the candidate for president must have a transregional appeal source 3 paragraph 18. This however is not true. According a map that shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes each state gets heshe could very well just get the votes from two regions and win the election. Yes you could say that two regions are transregional but this idea is based on collection of states from each region. Not one or two. Ponser also asserts that, ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election""paragraph 20. Here he is saying that only the Swinging Statessuch as Ohio Hawaiiwould determine who the president is for the whole counrty. How is letting a handful of people decide who the president will be a representation of the counrty as a whole? Short answer, its not. It would be foolish to put the choice for president into the hands of few, its like puting all our eggs into one basket and then throwing it off a roof.

There are a numerus amount of things that are not good about the electoral college. Bradford Plumer from the foundation for National Progress and author of Mother of Jones says that if there was to be a tie everything would be up to the House of representativessource two paragraph 12. That means each state gets one vote. One! The representative from Wyomingwho have 500,000 voterswould have the same amount of power as the representative from Californiawho has 35 million voters. This is in no way to run a country with fifty people representing about 250 million people. Plumer also states that the vorters can't always pick who their electors are paragraph 10. While the electors cannot be someone in office, who is to say that they may say one thing about who they will vote for but infact they vote for someone eles? It has happend before. Every one should get one vote and that be that non of this winner takes all stuff.

Finally we get to the part about the District of Columbia or Washington D.C.. The Office of the Federal Register wrote an article on the Electoral College and it says that D.C. is given three electors and treated like a statesource 1 paragraph 4. In one way this could be a good thing but in this casse it is a bad thing. The District of Columia is not a state and holds many goverment officials. Infact many people don't live in D.C. they live in one of the neighboring states. So why are we letting them have as much of a say as Vermount or Alaska or even one of the Dakostas?

To wrap this all up the corrupt system in which we elect a group of people to do what we want is not a very effective way to run a counrty in stage four of the Demographic Transistional Stages. Although president George W. Bush was an adiquate president there is still unfair that Al Gore had not become our president when he hat the popular vote.",0
"For centuries, we have followed a certain system established by our founding fathers. This system is called the electoral college. This system is based off voting for the president through electoral votes rather than based off more popular. The state has an overall say through its electors. I believe that this system is unfair and should be abolished.

The electoral college should be abolished because you are not voting directly for the president. You are voting for an elector who would in turn elect the president. While you may end up pleased, others may feel the complete opposite. I believe that it is unfair to not directly vote for the president bacause it should be completly up to this nation to elect a president. The system they have set up right now is injustice.

The second reason the electoral college should be taken away is that the system has much room for failure. Electors could easily betray the will of the people. They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completly oppose the most ""popular"" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the election ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could chose the president. Not only is this destroying the power of the general public but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates cuold go completly against what the people say because they technically have the right to since they have the power of the situation.

The final reason the electoral college system should be left behind is the fact that not every state gets to see the candidates. Some of the smaller states that don't count for much of the vote or tend to lean towards a different party don't even get a visit from the candidates. Not only is that unfair but it's also completly demaning towards the state. It makes the citizens of the state feel unworthy or not important enough for not even making an effort for their vote. This is also a stupid move on the candidates part because they might have been able to persuade the state's vote.

In conclusion, the electoral college is not a functional system for its characteristic of being completly indirect, for taking away the power of the people, and for its room for error. Although it may seem like a trustworthy system at first, don't be fooled.",0
"Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable. I don't think they're wrong. The electoral college is very unfair. It is unfair because the people's votes might be overuled, the electoral college is biased, and they may not pay any attention to the people's opinions.

First of all, in some cases the popular vote might not be of any value. Besides, the popular vote doesn't matter in the decision for president it elects members for the electoral college. So if I wanted to vote for a republican president but the electoral college ends up voting for the democrat I would have wasted my time going to vote. Clearly, the electoral college's vote overrules the popular vote.

In addition to overruling the popular vote, the people on the electoral college are biased. If the people who are on the electoral college are biased then, they might not take people's votes into account to their electoral vote. I know no one would want their vote to be ignored so this is another reason why the electoral college should be abolished. If a democracy means the people decide who their leaders are, then why are there other people who might not represent the people chosing our president. Quite obviously, the electoral college is biased and might not care about the popular vote.

Furthermore, even if the people's votes go to the electoral college, the college might not even pay attention to the reasons people give to vote for someone. Most people don't really care that their votes go to deciding who is on the electoral college, but they are missing the point. The electoral college are made up of human beings and they will say no to ideas they don't like. I don't think that the fate of our country should be resting on the idea that if one person doesn't like someone they will reject the idea. Obviously, the electoral college might reject some ideas just because they don't like them.

To conclude, the electoral college cannot be trusted to decide the future of our great nation. This group of electors might be biased, their votes overrule the popular vote, and they might not be open to opinions. Consider these reasons for the electoral college not deciding the future of the United States. These people cannot be trusted to vote for our new president.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in various parts of the world. This movement aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the roads, we can decrease the amount of air pollution and consequently improve the health of both individuals and the environment. For example, the car-free day implemented in Bogota, Colombia, resulted in a significant reduction in traffic jams and smog.

Secondly, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. As more and more people own cars, roads become crowded and commuting times increase. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and alleviate traffic congestion. Vauban, an experimental car-free community in Germany, is a prime example of how effective this approach can be. With only two places to park, the majority of residents do not own cars, resulting in less traffic and more peaceful streets.

Additionally, limiting car usage can promote physical activity and lead to healthier lifestyles. When cars are the primary mode of transportation, people often lead sedentary lives, spending hours sitting behind the wheel. By encouraging walking and biking, we can incorporate physical activity into our daily routines. Not only does this lead to improved physical health, but it also has positive effects on mental well-being. In cities like Bogota, where car-free days are a regular occurrence, millions of people take the opportunity to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams and creating a healthier and more active city.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and creating car-free communities, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, create more sustainable cities, and improve the overall health and well-being of individuals and the environment. The examples mentioned in the passage set show that this movement is gaining momentum, both in developed and developing countries, and that it has the potential to create a long-term cultural shift away from car dependency.",1
"The electoral college is how america chooses its president. The electoral college should not be how you think voting works but the complete opposite. It is a process that consist of electors who count the electoral votes. When a citizen votes their vote does not go directly as a vote for the president but it goes for the electoral college in your state. If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other then that state votes for that for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution by the founding fathers but it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used is because it takes away voters say in the decision for the president. If I vote for someone and the state doesnt pick him, that would mean my vote didn't count. That means i would now mean no one would even care about my vote. My vote wont even help make it a closer race. It's like my vote just vanishes into the air and is never seen again. If there are millions in the country and only 538 votes count. This is unrational to voters.

The second reason why the electoral college shouldn be used is because it isnt fair. It is especially unfair because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidates don't even waste time going to states they know they cant win but only focus on swing states, which for one takes away the privilege for the others that want to vote for the candidate to see them. It also takes away from the smaller states who don't get to put out as many votes as California with 55 or Florida with 29. Alot of states only have three votes and even though it could win or lose a races it still isn't fair to the people.

The electoral college was put into the Constitution by the founding fathers but they are not always right. The Constitution says all men are created equal but we still have had slavery. The Constitution has given us freedom of speech but once we step on school property that rule is taken away. The Constitution is not always the right way to go for everything. The founding fathers were very smart men but they have to think of how the country feels now because they were alive a long time ago.

In, conclusion the electoral college should just be put out of work because it is not the best way to elect a candidate, it takes away my say in the decision,the fairness, it was made by the great founding fathers but is outdated by how the counrty is now. Everyones vote should be out into play with the elections.",0
"Imagine constantly coughing. Would you like that? Car ownership is decreasing because: of pollution, people use other people who can drive, and the dangers. It is just not needed anymore.

Pollution is everywhere you go. THIS. It goes from China, to Europe, and to America. But what causes it? In Paris they banned driving after having nearrecord breaking pollution. France blamed it on their people wanting to use diesel fuel instead of gasoline. Cars that run on diesel takes up 67% of France. Paris has the most ""smog"" compared to the other parts of Europe. IS. After many days without driving any cars, car companies lost revenue, but the ""smog"" cleared up. A. By limiting the car usage pollution has goen down, making Paris a less of a polluted city. WASTE. Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. by Robert Duffer Before you go somewhere do you tend to call a friend to see if you can carpool? Now in America car pooling has been becoming quite popular. OF. With social media it is easier to contact your friends to see who is going where and when. Driving two separate cars is a waste of gas, time, and money. TIME. So carpooling is the most efficient. Many Americans have a love with cars from Mercedes, to bow's Americans are big fans. But are they dying out? statistics say that the percentage of people getting their license is 16 to 39 years old. With the entertainment at home what is the need to transport anywhere. Source 4: The end of car culture. By: Elisabeth Rosenthal. The need for cars is dying out.

overtime you get into a car there are dangers. Car accidents happen every single day, and most of them happen where you least expect it... One mile in diameter from your house. Source: Google There are also dangers of spending too much money on your car. Many Americans purchase die for cars Source 4: The End of Car Culture. By: Elisabeth Rosenthal, but can most of them afford it. Lets thing. A mcdonald's worker who makes 7.50 an hour, purchases a 100,000 Ranger Rover plus the insurance they have to pay every single month. Even though on your way to work people will see that you have a nice car and adore you, but a few months later the outcome will not be pretty. That person will eventually become bankrupt, have to sell their house, and their car, and live in a box for their entire life.Yahoo news And no one wants to live in a box. So limiting car use will help. If that mcdonald's worker never bought a car, and instead purchased a bike heshe would have money to buy food, and keep a roof over their head. Even though people now are fat and lazy it would also decrease the number of obese people in America.

To wrap things up, we should limit the use of cars. From Paris limiting it they decreased pollution, from carpooling you save money, and from not purchasing a car you will decrease your chances of dying. But the main question is..",0
"Everyday when you wake up and get ready for work there's always one thing you use, it's inched it's way into your daily life and now you wouldn't be able to do most things without it. It's your four wheeled friend that sits out in your driveway or garage, your car. Every day millions of people drive miles and miles in a car, using them to go to work or to go and see other people, but what people don't understand is the need to limit just how much they use their automobile companions.

Cars have changed our lives for the better and for the worse. They save us a tremendous amount of time by making traveling super efficient, but along with that is air pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gasses, and these gasses trap heat which in then leads to warming of the surface of the earth. This warming of the earth creates drastic changes in many environments such as the polar regions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to fifty percent in some car intensive areas"" This was stated in an article about German suburb life without cars. By limiting the amount of which we drive and by switching to alternative sources for transportation we can lower the amount of greenhouse gases and stop the heating of the earth.

Furthermore, these gases create smog. Smog is similar to fog but instead it has gases emitted from cars in it. Smog is usually thick and can be hazardous to environments. It was so bad in Paris that they set a partial driving ban in which people couldn't not drive because they didn't want the smog to get worse. The problem here is that people still continued to drive out even though there was a ban being enforce. So, this is another issue in which cutting back on car uses can fix. If we switch to biking to places that are withing biking distance or walking to place that are walking distance than we wouldn't have to worry about smog, or bans.

Automobiles have changed the way we live our lives and the way we do things, but they also have changed our communities. The typical city today consists of tall buildings and a surplus of streets and avenues, but parks are not as common. In Bogota there has been celebrating a day without cars for three years, and it has seen changes in the community. By having everyone give up their car for a day it can change their view on things, can make them notice things about the place in which they live in that they did't know about before. It can show them the beauty of their surroundings and this can lead to people wanting to protect that beauty and improve their city. This can be done in the form of building parks, and fixing uneven sidewalks.

So all in all, we depend on cars for daily purposes and it may seem hard to let go of your keys and walk, but if we all do that every once in a while it can lead to tremendous benefits. Imagine if you could walk outside and see people walking and enjoying themselves, not having to worry about gas prices or traffic jams. Imagine if we didn't have to worry about greenhouse gases or smog. Going for walk instead of driving may not seem like much, but it has major impacts on a multitude of things.",0

[City, State, Zip]

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the current system for electing the President of the United States. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College system rather than changing to an election by popular vote. While the Electoral College has its flaws, it serves as a necessary compromise and has several advantages that outweigh the potential disadvantages.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, for example, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only received 51.3% of the popular vote. This demonstrates how the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College creates a clear winner, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in disputes if the winning candidate only had a slight plurality, leading to contested results and undermining trust in the electoral process.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is everyone's president. No region in the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal and encourages them to campaign in all parts of the country. By ensuring that candidates seek support from diverse regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and gives voters in every state a stake in the election. This is a desirable outcome as it prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and making certain regions feel disenfranchised.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the importance of swing states. Under the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, candidates focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention from the candidates and have a greater opportunity to engage with them. These swing states tend to have more thoughtful voters who pay close attention to the issues and are more likely to make an informed decision. By allowing swing states to have a significant impact on the election outcome, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a greater say in choosing the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores the weight of large states in the political balance. The allocation of electoral votes is based on each state's population, which gives more weight to large states. This compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and issues of voters in large states. Without the Electoral College, candidates would likely focus on campaigning heavily in densely populated areas, neglecting the interests and needs of citizens in less populated states. The Electoral College guarantees a more balanced distribution of attention and resources from presidential candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College still produces a clear winner. This prevents the complication and cost of run-off elections, which can be time-consuming and result in prolonged political uncertainty. The Electoral College ensures that a candidate who achieves a majority in the Electoral College becomes the president, providing stability to our democratic system.

I understand that the current system may have some drawbacks, such as the winner-take-all approach which can result in candidates focusing on swing states and neglecting others. However, the advantages of the Electoral College in terms of certainty of outcome, national unity, focus on swing states, representation of large states, and avoidance of run-off elections make it a more effective and fair system for electing the president.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College system. While it may not be perfect, it strikes a balance between popular will and the need for stability and representation. Changing to a national popular vote system would undermine the purpose of the electoral process and ignore the diverse needs and interests of different states and regions. I believe that the Electoral College provides a more comprehensive and equitable approach to presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College system in the best interest of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"Cars may be a good source of travel, but, unknown to some, are dangerous to Earth and it's inhabitants. Limiting car usage to bicycles, walking, or any other option is a good idea. The reasons for this being that it makes traffic safer and, more importantly, reduces pollution.

To begin with, limiting use on cars makes traffic less of a hassle. For example, in the text, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" the author of this source reports that the effects of not using cars is, ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Source 3 Selsky Notice how, even in a big city, the effects of not using cars are extremely noticeable. If that carfree day makes it to EVERYWHERE in the planet, no more trafficrelated nonsense will occur. Furthermore, in the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" a citizen by the name of Heidrun Walter states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" Source 1 Rosenthal Even she finds that the lack of a car makes life easier for her. This statement, though some would prefer not to admit that they were tense drivers, is true, as being behind the wheel in a large amount of traffic could be stressful. It is agreeable that the effects of not using cars shows how much better life would be if they were removed permanently.

In addition to reducing traffic, limiting the use of cars could decrease the amount of pollution. To illustrate, in the excerpt, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer reports that, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Source 2 Duffer It is shocking that the amount of driving in that city caused so much pollution that they needed to enforce a law banning driving, a TEMPORARY law. It is baffling how Paris didn't keep that law intact. To add insult to injury, according to ""The End of Car Culture,"" Obama plans to curve the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, seein how ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" Source 4 Rosenthal Wow, driving causes such a large amount of emissions to the point that it is near the amount of power plant emissions. It seems rather unbelievable, and some would wish that the article wasn't true, but the use of cars is practically killing humanity. The point is that car usage is damaging Earth and preventing use would reduce the damage.

To wrap things up, reducing car usage would make traffic less of a risk and decrease pollution. Perhaps it will make the planet a better place, or fail in the end and continue to hurt the land some would call ""home"". Just remember this, when you continue to use whatever car you use, remember the dangers it may bring.",0
"  A Sustainable Future in Urban Planning  In an age marked by relentless urbanization and growing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as an innovative approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making space for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

"Limiting car usage will give us many benefits. A projects such as Vauban and BOGOTA were completed to show us the multitude of advantages received from it.

Reducing car usage would be excellent for our environment. Research shows us that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States""Rosenthal. Our world is very materialistic and sometimes we forget that to even have life, we must have the environment. ""Cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""Rosenthal. Therefore, limiting the amount of cars would allow us to have more efficient green houses, and more land area for plants.

Money is also a huge factor here. The government spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in the transportation department. By lowering the number of cars on the road, the less wear and tear is done to them. This would be beneficial in many departments because then we would have more money for the things we need but cannot afford in our area and or country. Infact, ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transportation""Rosenthal.

Driving also causes stress. Traffic jams, new or confusing road signs, attitudes of passengers, are all distribution of stress, especially when you get lost! If the amount of driving we did by ourselves was cut back, we could also cut back stress. BOGOTA helps to prove this, and even says that violaters of no car day were ""fined 25Selsky.

Lastly, if we do not put a stop to so much driving, our personal health may be in risk. According to souce 4, ""the car industry is the second largest in the world."" This means that the air is constantly being polluted with exhuast. Which also means that what's in your lungs at this very moment, could be a lot more than just oxygen. It's very scary to think that the same chemicals it takes to run your car, might just be what's floating around in your body. This could lead to multiple health problems and future diseases. Therefore, this issue needs to be taken control of immediately.

In conclusion, reducing car usage would be an amazing thing to do for oursleves and the people around us. We would save our air and bodies from being polluted, we would save money, and save time not stressing out. Who doesn't want these things? Limiting car usage would be a fantastic idea.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, After reviewing information about the Electoral College, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used in deciding or electing the president of the United States.

""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the President."" The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electorss that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President. It is really in the hands of the electorss who will become President.

Secondly, after realizing that the number of electorsal votes decides if you become President or not, the Presidential candidates are going to want to focus on obtaining the most votes as possible. After determining which states they ""have in the bag"", the candidates are going to put their campaigning efforts toward the ""tossup"" or ""swing states"". Here they will have to compete in a tight race between the other party to sway the voters of the state to vote their way. This method of campaigning in the swing states doesn't allow for much campaigning in the big, numerous votes states. An example of this would be that during the 2000 campaign, almost 20 states did not see the candidates at all as well as campaign ads. With the Electoral College system in place, Presidential candidates are focusing more on obtaining the ""swing state"" votes and not so much on supporting and visiting the states and people they know they have.

Finally, the system of electing electorss who then vote for the President can be considered unpredictable. This being because the electorss could at any time defy the will of the people. These shady electorss, also known as ""faithless electorss"", can deny to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast the vote for whomever they desire. This shows that it is not the people's choice, instead the choice of the electors. Also, the state legislatures are responsible for choosing the electorss. This could cause an issue where the state legislatures are choosing electorss who will vote for their party. Let's take it back to the 1960's where an example of this corruption almost took place. Segrigationists, or people who favored racial separation, who were state legislatures in the state of Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. This would've caused the popular vote to go to Kennedy's opponent. For the many reasons listed above, the Electoral College could be considered unpredictable and in some cases... shady.

Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote. This being because the people are not directly voting, the candidates are just focusing on getting the votes and not on the people. And lastly because it can be considered unpredictable with the ""faithless electorss"" and bais state legislatures.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable society. Reducing car dependency has many benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more efficient and accessible transportation systems.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, which can have detrimental effects on public health. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impact of car emissions on air quality. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for everyone.

Limiting car usage also promotes physical activity. When people rely less on cars and more on walking, cycling, or using public transportation, they are more likely to engage in physical activity on a daily basis. This can lead to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, weight management, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota demonstrates how promoting alternative transportation methods can encourage people to lead more active lifestyles.

In addition to these benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to more efficient and accessible transportation systems. The passage about Vauban, Germany, shows how creating car-free communities can encourage the use of public transportation and make everyday activities more accessible. By designing cities and suburbs that prioritize walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can reduce traffic congestion, save time, and create more inclusive and equitable communities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage comes with numerous advantages. By reducing car dependency, we can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and create more efficient and accessible transportation systems. It is crucial that we embrace smart planning and adopt measures to limit car usage for the benefit of our environment, public health, and overall quality of life.",1
"Limiting car usage can have many advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, where initiatives have been implemented to reduce car dependency and promote alternative forms of transportation. By limiting car usage, not only can greenhouse gas emissions be reduced, but other benefits such as improved air quality, reduced congestion, and enhanced community connections can also be achieved.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban, emissions can be significantly decreased, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on air quality. The smog problem faced by cities like Paris is a direct result of vehicle emissions, particularly from diesel fuel. By enforcing driving bans, like the one implemented in Paris, cities can effectively reduce air pollution and improve the overall health of their citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in congestion. Cities like Bogota have implemented car-free days to alleviate traffic congestion and promote alternative forms of transportation. By encouraging people to use public transportation, walk, or cycle, roads become less congested and commuting becomes more efficient for everyone. This not only saves time but also reduces stress for commuters.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help strengthen community connections. In neighborhoods like Vauban, where cars are not allowed on the streets, people rely on bicycles and walking as their primary means of transportation. This not only encourages a more active and healthy lifestyle, but it also fosters a sense of community among residents who interact more frequently. In addition, having stores and amenities within walking distance, as seen in Vauban, promotes local businesses and reduces the need for long drives to shopping malls.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, alleviate congestion, and enhance community connections. By looking at successful examples like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, it is clear that smart planning and the promotion of alternative transportation can lead to a more sustainable and livable future. It is crucial for individuals and governments alike to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies that promote more sustainable forms of transportation.",1
"  Pioneering Urban Sustainability  In a world characterized by accelerating urbanization and mounting environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a forward-thinking approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. Car-free cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the key benefits of car-free cities lies in their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"Dear state senator, I personally believe that we should stick to and continue the idea of the Electoral College. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted to vote for the right candidate. Secondly, there isn't much that can go wrong in the Electoral College. Last but not least, by electing a president of the United States through popular vote, the right person may not be elected to be president for our country.

To start off, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that are trusted by the parties to make the right vote for president. The Electoral College is a system that was created by the founding fathers created in the Constitution. When voters go off to the polls most have the thought in their mind that they are voting for their next president when they really are not. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors, which ever candidate gets the majority of 270 electoral votes wins the election. In source 3, the passage states ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". The electors that are in the Electoral College are selected by a certain party and the party trust that the person will vote for that certain party's candidate. With this process, the candidate that ends up getting elected is more likely the right candidate for the president spot.

Secondly, when using the Electoral College there ins't too many things that can go wrong. Most people that choose to go against the Electoral College would say that ""with the Electoral College its not really our choice when we vote because in the end the electors from the party vote for the president"". In source 2, the passage states ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" If a tie with the electoral votes is to ever take place, the House of Representatives would handle the election and state delegations would have the final vote for president. Also, if a tie does take place then the Senate would vote for the vicepresident.

Last but not least, if we switch to the popular vote election process then the right president candidate may not always be elected. This point can go against both sides. The side that supports the Electoral College may say ""the people may vote for a certain candidate because of his color or race"". The side that supports the popular vote system may say ""when we go out to vote it doesn't count towards anything because of the electors in the Electoral College. So why are we even going out to the polls to vote?"" Also, with the Electoral College there will not be any runoff elections. In source 3, the passage states ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"".

In conclusion, I believe we should keep the Electoral College system going so we can have a more fluent election process. For one, there are trusted electors in the Electoral College that the parties trust to make the right vote. Secondly, when using the Electoral College there isn't too many things that can go wrong with the election process. Last but not least, if we switch to the popular vote election process them the right president candidate may not always be elected.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards limiting car usage in communities around the world. This shift is driven by various factors, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The passage set highlights that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars produce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to smog and respiratory problems. The passage set gives examples of cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Limiting car usage also has benefits for individuals. Not owning a car can be liberating and lead to a less stressful lifestyle. In the passage set, residents of Vauban, Germany, express their happiness at not owning cars, stating that they feel more relaxed and at ease. This is because car ownership comes with various costs and responsibilities, such as maintenance, insurance, and finding parking spaces. By limiting car usage, individuals can save money and reduce the stress and hassles associated with car ownership.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and walkable communities. The passage set mentions the trend of making suburbs more accessible to public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities in this way, we can reduce the need for cars and promote healthier and more active lifestyles. Walking or cycling as a means of transportation also has various health benefits, such as increased physical activity and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that benefit both individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace this movement and prioritize smart planning that limits car usage in order to build a more sustainable future.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system in selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments both for and against the Electoral College, I firmly believe that this system is essential for promoting an effective and fair democratic process.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This significantly reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome and ensures a smoother transition of power. In contrast, a direct election based solely on popular vote may result in multiple candidates earning similar percentages of the vote, leading to prolonged run-off elections and potential political instability.

Another crucial aspect of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as highlighted by Judge Posner. Since no specific region in the United States has enough electoral votes on its own, candidates must campaign across the country and appeal to diverse interests and perspectives. This ensures that the president represents the entirety of the nation and is more likely to consider the interests of all Americans. Without the Electoral College, candidates could focus solely on populous areas, effectively ignoring the needs and concerns of citizens in sparsely populated regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system incentivizes candidates to actively engage with voters in swing states. As discussed by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus campaign efforts on competitive states. This not only increases voter engagement but also ensures that the most thoughtful and informed voters, who closely follow the campaign and its issues, have a larger role in deciding the outcome. This promotes a more educated electorate and a greater emphasis on substantive policy discussions.

In addition, the Electoral College gives due weight to the large states by counterbalancing the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as explained by Judge Posner. States with larger populations naturally have more electoral votes, which in turn attracts candidates to campaign in those states. This ensures that the concerns and interests of voters in populous states receive adequate attention, balancing the influence of smaller states and avoiding a situation where candidates disproportionately prioritize the needs of a few regions.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. As Judge Posner points out, this prevents the complication and potential disruption caused by a prolonged election process when no candidate receives a majority of votes. The Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, providing stability and continuity in the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages voter turnout, the evidence suggests otherwise. As mentioned by Judge Posner, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 presidential election, demonstrating that a significant portion of the population understands the importance of expressing their political preference. The system ensures that all votes within a state contribute to the decision-making process, regardless of whether their preferred candidate wins the state's electoral votes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages candidates to engage with voters in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. I believe that these reasons justify the continued use of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully analyze all viewpoints before making a decision that best represents the interests of our great state and the entire nation.

Sincerely,

"Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just how irrelevant, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency Source 2. Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce Source 2, and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors Source 1. This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" Source 2. If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win Sources 1 and 3. Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters Source 3, but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?!

The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. If this is to occur, then state delegates in the House of representatives decide the President Source 2. Each state only casts one vote, so the representative from Rhode Island would have just as much to say as the 55 representatives from the state of California Source 1 and 2. Not only that, but a majority of people vote one party for president and another for Congress Source 3. There are 538 possible votes in the electoral college Source 1, so it isn't impossible for a tie to happen. In 1976, if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had switched candidates, there would have been a tie Source 2.

And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mindboggling confusing. The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government Sources 1 and 2. In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election Source 2. In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent Source 3. Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else Source 2.

In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.",0

Subject: In Support of the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to share my reasons for opposing a change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a direct popular vote. It consists of a process where electors are chosen based on the number of members in their state's Congressional delegation, including Representatives and Senators. Each candidate running for President has their own group of electors, who are generally chosen by their political party.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College system ensures a clear winner, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in each state, incentivizing candidates to campaign nationwide and appeal to a diverse range of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a unifying President who represents all regions of the country. As no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that the President takes into account the interests of all regions, preventing the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents in regions that may not be strongholds for a particular candidate.

The Electoral College also gives significance to swing states, allowing for a more focused and meaningful campaign. Candidates are encouraged to concentrate their efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, ensuring that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates' policies and plans. This fosters engagement and informed decision-making among voters in swing states.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance between small and large states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate can lead to a disparity in representation, the Electoral College guarantees that all states have a voice and influence in the presidential election process. Large states receive more attention from candidates due to their higher number of electoral votes, ensuring that their concerns and priorities are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time, resources, and potential complications in the election process. History has shown that the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even in cases where a candidate has only achieved a plurality of the popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several benefits and serves as a vital component of our democracy. It ensures a clear and certain outcome, promotes a unifying President who represents all regions, encourages meaningful campaigning in swing states, provides balance between small and large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and advocate for its preservation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective as you deliberate on this important issue. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or require further information. 

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage has gained momentum in recent years, with numerous benefits becoming apparent. One of the advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. In the passage about Vauban, Germany, it is mentioned that 70% of families in the community do not own cars. This means that residents are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking public transit. These activities contribute to increased physical activity and better overall health. In fact, in Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of a car-free day resulted in millions of people hiking, biking, and skating to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on air quality. The passage about Paris discusses how a partial driving ban was enforced due to intense smog. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Vehicles, especially diesel ones, are a major source of air pollution, so reducing their usage can have a significant impact on the quality of air we breathe.

In addition to these environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient and sustainable urban planning. The passage mentions the concept of ""smart planning,"" which involves separating suburban life from auto use. This means creating communities where stores are located within walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible. By doing so, we can reduce the need for large parking spaces, which take up valuable land, and encourage more people to use alternative modes of transportation.

Finally, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. In the passage about Vauban, Germany, it is mentioned that 57% of families sold a car to move there. This suggests that owning a car is a significant financial burden for many individuals and families. By reducing car usage, people can save money on car ownership, fuel, insurance, and maintenance costs. Additionally, the passage mentions that delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the driving ban in Paris. However, exceptions were made for vehicles carrying three or more passengers, which encourages carpooling and helps reduce transportation costs for individuals.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of healthy lifestyles, improvement of air quality, more efficient urban planning, and economic benefits. By adopting smart planning principles and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can create greener, healthier, and more sustainable communities.",1

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider retaining this system for the election of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several important advantages that should be preserved.

One of the main arguments for the Electoral College is its ability to ensure certainty of outcome. In a winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. This was demonstrated in the 2012 election, where President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. Furthermore, the winner-take-all method ensures that even a slight majority in a state can lead to a significant electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of “everyone’s president.” Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own, candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This encourages candidates to campaign across the country, engaging with voters from various regions and considering their diverse interests. It prevents candidates with only regional appeal from being successful presidents and helps avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of states where candidates focus less of their campaign efforts.

The Electoral College's focus on swing states also benefits the electoral process and encourages thoughtful voting. Candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, which leads to increased engagement and attention from voters in these swing states. These voters are often more informed and more likely to pay attention to the candidates' messages. Allowing the most thoughtful voters to decide the election ensures that the election outcome reflects the will of the well-informed citizens.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives due weight to large states. Since the Electoral College is based on the number of congressional representatives, larger states have more influence than they would have in a purely popular vote system. This balance is crucial in redressing the power imbalance caused by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By providing greater attention to large states during campaigns, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns of a wider range of citizens and ensure that their interests are represented.

Lastly, by avoiding run-off elections, the Electoral College simplifies the presidential election process. Run-off elections, which would be necessary if no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, could greatly complicate the process and prolong the period of uncertainty. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College ensures a smooth transition of power and avoids potential complications associated with unresolved elections.

While some argue that a popular vote system would increase voter participation, research shows that voters in presidential elections are motivated to express their political preferences rather than exert decisive influence over the outcome. The Electoral College does not discourage participation but rather focuses it on expressing preferences rather than choosing a winner.

In conclusion, the Electoral College offers important advantages that should be preserved. It ensures certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages thoughtful voting through swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids run-off elections. While it is not a perfect system, it has demonstrated its resilience and ability to maintain the integrity of the election process. I urge you to consider these arguments and support the retention of the Electoral College for future presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"As an American citizen, I am aware that cars are a big form of transportation. For me that is my way of getting everywhere. But I never really thought about the consequences of driving a car or even that there may be advantages to not driving one. Other countries have realized that their are advantages and are working on promoting citizens to use other types of transportation. Through out the world many countries are pushing for ""carfree"" areas and eventually ""carfree"" countries. Many of these countries are trying different strategies to accomplish this goal. Some examples would be Paris, where they only permit certain cars to drive each day depending on their license plate number, as found in source 2, parts of Germany are creating ""carfree"" communities and if you want to have a car you must pay 40,000 dollars in order to park in a parking garage in the front of the community, according to source 1, even Cities in Colombia promote what they call a Day Without Cars, as said in source 3. Even though here in the United States we haven't enforced any laws against driving, some citizens are choosing to not to drive. These countries are creating these new lifestyles in order to prevent air pollution, take away the stress of driving on the roads, and to bring the communities closer together.

As many people may already know, cars release greenhouse gasses that are harmful to our environment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger cars are responsible for up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions into the environment."" Parts of Germany are working to solve this issue by creating ""carfree"" communities. Some of these communities house up to 5500 residents. This change is getting a positive reaction, with more people moving into these communities than predicted. This is a movement called ""smart planning"" which is a trend that is growing and spreading into many parts of Europe, some parts of the United States and elsewhere.

Paris however is trying a different strategy that doesnt require people moving into completely new areas. They are now enforcing laws permitting certain cars to drive on their designated days. For example, on Mondays drivers who's cars have evennumbered license plates must leave their cars at home and find a different form of transportation for that day or else they will be fined 22euros31. So far 4,000 drivers have been fined. Paris's goal is also to cut down the emission of harmful gasses into the environment but mainly trying to reduce smog. Since deisel fuel is a large contributor and the majority of the vehicles in Paris run on diesel fuel they are cutting down the number days you are allowed to drive.

Colombia is also using Paris' strategy, but their ""carfree"" days are limited to once every year. Colombia has been using this stategy for 3 years and each year getting a better turnout of people participating. Violators who choose to drive on this day known as the Day Without Cars day, are fined 25. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation, interaction between citizens, limit individuals stress levels, and reduce smog. Heidrun Walter, a citizen in Colombia quoted, ""When I drive my car I'm always tense. I'm much happier when I'm not behind the wheel."" Haidrun is just one of many citizens who have expressed their interest in this new method.

After looking at the consequences of driving a car, and seeing the multiple advantages of not having one has changed my perspective on things. I know the feeling of being stressed when driving and I've always thought, if I could I would choose a different form of transportation. After seeing other countries promoting their citizens to choose alternative forms of transportation, I now hope the United States will enforce something similar. Not only do you help the environment but it is safer for yourself and everyone around you. Living a lifestyle with no air pollution, stress, or traffic jams will be safer and more efficient. Hopefully every other citizens perspective on this will change, if it hasn't already. I'm lookinf forward to seeing you walking next to me on the sidewalk.",0

Subject: Support for the Preservation of the Electoral College

Dear Senator [State Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the preservation of the Electoral College in the process of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several compelling reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As mentioned in the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election's outcome. With the winning candidate needing to secure a majority of electoral votes, the system provides a clear winner and minimizes the chances of a tie or inconclusive election.

In addition, the Electoral College guarantees that the elected president represents the entire nation. Judge Posner states that the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no region alone has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that candidates need to campaign and garner support from various regions, ensuring that the president represents the interests of a diverse range of citizens. If we were to switch to a popular vote system, candidates may focus their campaigns on densely populated areas, neglecting the needs and concerns of citizens in less populated regions. By maintaining the Electoral College, we promote a more balanced and inclusive representation of the American people.

The Electoral College also emphasizes the importance of swing states, which is crucial for fostering a well-informed electorate. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" Judge Posner mentions how the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates' campaigns and policies, fostering a more thoughtful and informed electorate. This plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and quality of our democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a vital check on the influence of large states. According to Judge Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states in the political balance that they lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By awarding electoral votes proportionately to each state's population, the system ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on the support of densely populated states. This prevents candidates from exclusively catering to the needs and interests of those living in highly populous areas, making the presidency more accessible to citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complexities of run-off elections. As Judge Posner points out, the Electoral College produces a clear winner, even when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the need for time-consuming and potentially costly run-off elections that may further divide the nation. The Electoral College streamlines the election process by providing a decisive outcome and allows the country to move forward promptly.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters, as mentioned in the passage ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer, statistics show that a significant portion of the eligible population still exercises their right to vote. Voters participate in the election to express their political preference rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will determine the outcome. This suggests that the Electoral College does not discourage engagement or interest in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a fundamental role in our democratic system by ensuring certainty of outcome, fostering a representative presidency, encouraging a well-informed electorate, providing a balance of power between states, and avoiding the complexities of run-off elections. For these reasons, I implore you to support the preservation of the Electoral College. It is essential for maintaining a strong and inclusive democracy that represents the diverse interests and needs of all American citizens.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the benefits of the Electoral College and make an informed decision that upholds the principles of fairness and representation in our electoral process.

"Cars have been the main focus of development for many years now. Engineers attempt to create sufficient cars every time a new model is planned. Many citizens of the United States are slightly aware of the environmental damage that is caused by the cars, yet still do no think twice when it comes to driving anywhere. Many countries around the world have set fines and laws against using cars and have seemed to produce a positive outcome. These countries offer many different alternatives to using cars, creating a well developed society.

While cars are a huge advantage to modern day society, they take a big toll on our environment. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the Company, cars are the ""second largest source of America's emission"" proving how much we rely on cars source 4 paragraph 34.She also writes about numbers terrifying to the future generations. United States is responsible for 50 percent greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe while Europe is only responsible for 12source 1 paragraph 5. 50 percent is proof that Americans are too reliable on transportation sources like streets, main roads, and highways. Paris was able to clear the air from pollution. According to Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune ,after enforcing a driving ban, the air cleared after an almost record setting pollution fog source 2 paragraph 10. Places in Asia like Beijing, China are just filled with smog in the air. The citizens walk around with masks because of the heavy pollution. That is physically dangerous for not only the adults, but the children of the communities. There has to be some alternatives to using cars in excess. Almost anything can be an advantage but when it is used too much, it will always be dangerous.

Even though cars are important to commerce within society, many alternatives can be taken to help lower the usage of cars. In places like the capital of Columbia, they have found a way to travel places and limit the car use. Andrew Selsky, from the Seattle Times , speaks of this matter. He claims that there has been ""construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" in the city of Bogota source 3 paragraph 27. Not only does this allow the citizens to be environmentally friendly, but it gives them a chance to exercise, which leads to better health. It is noticeable the the healthier people tend to be more lifting than the sluggish, corpulent citizens. In Barcelona, Spain, being a vehicle owner is simple undesired. Other means of transportation like walking or bicycling have been the desired means of getting places. Even Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford Motor Company, admits to the impractical use of cars in excess. There are some many different ways the we can reduce the use of Cars in the American nation.

With the ability of using bikes to arrive at destinations, many places have seen the improvements in reduced traffic jams. What Americans hate the most are traffic jams. Think about those times when 10 minutes have slipped away in the morning and you are running late then there is a traffic jam. Millions in Columbia participated in hiking or biking and it left the street nearly empty source 3 paragraph 20. The citizens were smart enough to recognize when they need a car. When going to work that is only 5 miles away, they take the extra time to reduce the usage of the streets. France experienced the same result, reducing traffic congestion by 60 percent, and then lowering the smog that had covered them source 2 paragraph 14. This leaves the street safer for drivers and pedestrians. It also reduces the heavy noise from motored vehicles.

Many nations have improved their societies by reducing the use of cars. In result, the air pollution is reduced, the health benefits improve, and the traffic congestion is heavily reduced. Not only can reducing our relience on cars benefit our genertaion, but it can benefit the generations to come.",0

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my perspective on the debate regarding the Electoral College and the system by which we elect the President of the United States. After careful consideration and examining various arguments from multiple sources, I am convinced that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's publication on the Electoral College, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is lessened in comparison to a dispute over the popular vote. The winner-take-all basis of electoral votes awarded by most states ensures that even the slightest plurality creates a landslide victory for a candidate in that particular state.

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. By requiring a presidential candidate to gain support across different regions, the Electoral College ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. As Judge Richard A. Posner contends, this is a desirable result as it prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being successful. This system ensures that the president elected has the interests of all regions in mind, making them ""everyone's president.""

Thirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are encouraged to engage more with voters in these states. As seen in the 2012 election, swing states attract more attention from the candidates, leading to a higher level of engagement and thoughtful voting. In a system based solely on the popular vote, candidates may neglect areas where their victory or loss is already predetermined, resulting in fewer engaged voters overall.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as established in the Constitution, grants large states fewer electoral votes on a per capita basis. However, as Judge Posner points out, a large state like Florida, despite having a close popular vote in 2012, was able to secure 29 electoral votes. This allocation of electoral votes ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of more populous states, providing fair representation to citizens across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. Instead of requiring a majority vote, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. Run-off elections can be complicated and time-consuming, as seen in cases like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, who won a majority in the Electoral College despite only having a plurality of the popular votes. By avoiding run-off elections, the Electoral College streamlines the process and ensures a clear and decisive outcome.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it can lead to less voter engagement in non-competitive states, the high voter turnout in the 2012 election reveals that voters are motivated by the desire to express a political preference rather than the expectation that their vote will decide the election. Additionally, the Electoral College serves to protect against the disaster factor, highlighted by Bradford Plumer, where state legislatures and ""faithless"" electors could disrupt the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, with its practical reasons for existence, provides a fair and balanced method of electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. These advantages outweigh the criticisms and calls for its abolition. Therefore, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals and communities. The examples provided in the passage set highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to air pollution, releasing harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, we can significantly decrease our carbon footprint and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights the negative impact of car emissions on air quality. Intense smog levels in the city prompted the enforcement of a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for individuals to live in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity and overall health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota demonstrates how promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and skating can encourage people to engage in physical activity. By incorporating active modes of transportation into our daily routines, we can improve our cardiovascular health and reduce the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. The passage about the German suburb of Vauban highlights the concept of ""smart planning,"" which aims to separate suburban life from car use. By designing communities with pedestrian-friendly streets and access to public transportation, we can create more compact and accessible neighborhoods. Placing stores within walking distance, rather than on distant highways, encourages active transportation and reduces the need for car dependency.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more sustainable communities, we can create a healthier and more environmentally-friendly future. It is important to consider alternative modes of transportation and implement smart planning strategies to reduce our reliance on cars and create a more sustainable society.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in countries around the world to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to create more compact and accessible suburbs, decrease reliance on cars, and improve the overall quality of life for residents. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and have been observed in various communities across the globe.

One notable example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. In this experimental district, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden, except for a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move to this car-free community. The absence of cars has significantly improved the quality of life for residents. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, expressed her happiness with the car-free lifestyle, stating, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This sentiment is shared by many residents who now enjoy the tranquility of verdant streets, filled with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children, rather than the noise and stress of cars.

Not only do car-free communities like Vauban provide a more peaceful living environment, but they also have a positive impact on the environment itself. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation options such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, these car-free communities significantly reduce emissions and combat climate change. The success of Vauban and other similar communities in reducing emissions highlights the effectiveness of limiting car usage in mitigating the harmful environmental effects of cars.

The advantages of limiting car usage are not limited to car-free communities. Cities like Paris have also implemented measures to reduce car usage, such as driving bans during periods of intense smog. Paris enforced a partial driving ban, requiring motorists with even-numbered license plates to leave their cars at home on certain days. This resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped clear the air of pollution. These temporary driving bans illustrate how limiting car usage can have an immediate positive impact on air quality and public health.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to improved urban planning and development. Traditionally, suburbs have been designed around car use, with sprawling developments and extensive parking spaces. However, smart planning advocates for more compact and accessible suburbs, with stores placed within walking distance and an emphasis on public transportation. This approach not only reduces the need for cars but also creates vibrant and sustainable communities. These walkable neighborhoods encourage physical activity, facilitate social interactions, and support local businesses.

Moreover, limiting car usage has the potential to shift cultural norms and improve overall well-being. In the United States, there has been a decrease in car ownership, driving, and the percentage of young people getting driver's licenses. This shift in behavior can be attributed to various factors, such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, and the availability of car-sharing programs. As people become less dependent on cars for their daily activities, they experience reduced stress, improved health, and increased mobility options.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant and far-reaching. Car-free communities like Vauban demonstrate the positive impact of living without cars, from increased happiness and tranquility to reduced emissions and improved air quality. Temporary driving bans, as seen in Paris, also illustrate the immediate benefits of limiting car usage in combating pollution. Furthermore, smart planning initiatives that promote compact suburbs, alternative transportation options, and increased walkability have the potential to reshape communities and improve overall well-being. As more countries adopt measures to limit car usage, these advantages will continue to be realized, creating a more sustainable and enjoyable future for all.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in the passages provided, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained. While there are valid concerns about its democratic nature, the Electoral College offers practical benefits that outweigh these concerns.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of the outcome. As stated in passage 18, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. With almost all states awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a small plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral vote victory. This provides a clear mandate for the elected president and helps prevent prolonged disputes over the election results.

Another important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal, as addressed in passage 19. By requiring a candidate to have support across multiple regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being successful. This helps ensure that the president represents the interests of the entire country, rather than a specific region. It also prevents residents of certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and not having their voices heard in the election process.

The focus on swing states is another advantage of the Electoral College, as mentioned in passage 20. Since the winner-take-all method is employed, candidates concentrate their campaign efforts on these states. This leads to increased attention from the candidates and encourages voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign and make more informed decisions. By giving these states a pivotal role in deciding the election, the Electoral College enhances the engagement and thoughtfulness of voters, which ultimately results in a more informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives appropriate weight to the large states, as discussed in passage 21. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, which grants equal representation to each state regardless of its population, smaller states would otherwise have disproportionately more influence in a popular vote system. The Electoral College balances this by allocating electoral votes based on each state's population. This ensures that a large state like Florida, for example, receives more attention from candidates during the campaign, while still giving smaller states their fair share of influence.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes, as stated in passage 22. This prevents prolonged election processes and complications by guaranteeing a clear winner. With the Electoral College in place, there is no need for additional rounds of voting, saving time, resources, and reducing the chances of instability in the election process.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage voters who know their state is likely to vote in favor of one party, as mentioned in passage 23, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. People who vote in presidential elections are motivated by a desire to express their political preference, regardless of the impact of their individual vote on the national election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may not be a perfect system, but it provides practical benefits for selecting the President of the United States. It ensures certainty in the outcome, promotes national unity, increases voter engagement in swing states, gives proportional weight to large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. By considering these advantages, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by maintaining the Electoral College, we can continue to ensure a fair and effective election process for the presidency.

Sincerely,

"Transportation by a vehicle like a car is very common these days. It's an efficient way to travel for the most part, and has been used as an option for traveling since the early 1900s. Although cars have many upsides, they also have downsides too. By limiting car usage in more places, there could be many advantages. First, it could improve safety. Also, it will conserve resources. And lastly, limiting car usage will allow a tremendous decrease in pollution.

Limiting car usage will improve safety in a number of ways. By limiting car usage, there will most likely be a decrease in deaths since many car accidents result in fatality. It is not only cars colliding with other cars that is the issue it is cars having the power to destroy most things it comes in contact with. Cars are not toys but rather death machines. They have the ability to cause major damage which is why if limited usage is enforced, there will most likely be less accidents resulting in majorminor injuries or even death. There are many options for getting around besides using a car. For example, there are electric scooters, mopeds, skateboards, rollerskates, bicycles, and even good oldfashioned walking. While some of these could potentially be dangerous, they are probably not as dangerous as driving a car.

Another reason limiting car usage could be beneficial is the conservation of resources. Cars are heavy machinery and need an abundance of fuel to keep them going for years and years. What powers most vehicles currently is fossil fuel. Fossil fuel is not an everlasting resource and will be gone someday. Now there are some cars that run on electricity, but for the most part, cars around the world run on fossil fuel. Considering that there are about one to two cars per household nowadays, that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas or even being charged with electricity which could run your electricity bill through the roof. Since this applies to most people around the world, think of the resources being used daily. This usage of resources could be lessened by just limiting the usage of cars.

The last benefit of limiting car usage is less air pollution. Cars run on fossil fuel, as I stated in the previous paragraph. When a car is being driven, that fuel exits the car in a gas state. This gas form of fuel is very harmful to the environment. With so many cars on the road today, the atmosphere is already polluted a great deal.

Usually you will see signs that read ""No Idling"" outside of a store or any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked, and are going to be parked for an extended period of time, you should turn your car off so that it does not let out gas. In Paris, a partial driving ban was actually enforced so that the amount of smog in the air would decrease. That is how much the usage of cars can affect an environment.

Overall, setting a limitation on car usage in more places can have benefits. It could improve safety, conserve resources, and allow for less pollution to the environment. With these reasons, I don't see many reasons for people to frown upon this idea.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can bring several advantages to society. This is increasingly recognized in different parts of the world, as efforts are made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote more sustainable forms of transportation. By minimizing car dependence, communities can benefit from improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and enhanced overall quality of life.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Automobiles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States (Passage 5). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere, helping to combat climate change. Initiatives such as car-free neighborhoods, like Vauban in Germany, aim to create communities that prioritize sustainable transportation options such as public transit and walking. These initiatives demonstrate that it is possible to live without cars and still enjoy a high quality of life (Passage 2).

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. As more people adopt alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, or using public transit, the number of vehicles on the road decreases, leading to less congestion and smoother traffic flow. The implementation of car-free days, as seen in Bogota, Colombia, has proven successful in reducing traffic jams and promoting alternative modes of transportation (Passage 26). Less time spent in traffic congestion also means reduced stress levels for commuters and an overall improvement in mental well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. Paris, for example, enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, resulting in a significant reduction in congestion and a 60 percent decrease in congestion levels (Passage 14). By decreasing car usage and promoting cleaner forms of transportation, such as electric vehicles or public transit, we can reduce the emissions of harmful pollutants and improve the respiratory health of communities.

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive social and economic impacts. By creating car-free neighborhoods, like Vauban in Germany, communities become more walkable and pedestrian-friendly, encouraging social interaction and reducing social isolation (Passage 3). These neighborhoods often prioritize the development of local amenities, such as shops and restaurants, making daily activities easily accessible within walking or biking distance (Passage 6). This not only enhances the livability of these neighborhoods but also promotes local economic growth.

In conclusion, limiting car usage brings several advantages to society. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to decreasing traffic congestion and enhancing quality of life, the benefits are numerous. By prioritizing sustainable forms of transportation and creating car-free communities, we can create a more environmentally-friendly and socially vibrant future for all. It is time to shift our focus from car-dependent lifestyles to smarter planning and livable neighborhoods.",1
"From saving money to having less pollution, limiting car usage has its advantages. Many believe that having a car is needed to operate in today's society. While others think it is a last resort when all other transportation opportunities are unavailable. While they both have good points, it is said that less car usage has its benefits.

A good benefit is less pollution. In source one of "" In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosental discusses of a Vauban, a tighted fitted community suburb that is a growing trend in Europe. Despite having to be restricted to using your vehicle, passenger cars are only responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe while the United States experiences 50 percent in some carintensive areas. Then in source two of ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer tells about a ban that France enforced to help clear the air from the world known city of Paris. With cold nights and warm days it caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission and that was when it was enough for France. Due to such a ban, enough smog cleared from some passengers could drive again.

Another is more community interaction. In source three of "" Carfree day is spinning a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky tells of Bogota, Columbia and its program of spending its citizens to experience a day without a car. Millions Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. Instead of one single person being stuck in their car through traffic, they had many people placed in one bus. Due to such a wonderful opportunity many people felt less stressed. More people were seen together then by themselves that even parks and sports centers were blooming throughout the city.

Another benefit would be less traffic. In source four of "" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal discover in recent studies of new generations buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses. As people ride the busses more, carpool with friends or even just mobility connected with friends instead of driving less traffic has occurred. Since this has been going on pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connectednetwork to save time and converse resources.

Cars, the nicotine in a cigerate, can hurt our earth. From studies shown limiting car usage can bring its advantages.",0
"Dear Senator, ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""Office of the Federal register. Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process.

In Richard poster's, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winnertakeall basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state"" Posner 1. With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the candidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not acknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" The Office of the Federal Register 1. This adds support that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a successful one.

In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the candidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reiterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...Office of the Federal Register 1. In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the candidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""Posner 1. With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the candidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen tp the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election""Posner 1. Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" Plumer 1. The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, "" Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" Plumerr 1. This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" Posner 1. The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.",0
"Dear senator, I believe the Electoral College System is wrong.

In source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."". In other words, your vote is basically in the hands of someone else, and hopefully they vote for who you want what's even worse is electors are picked on at state conventions, sometimes state party's central committee, or even sometimes the presidential candidates, so you, the citizens don't get to pick the elector. Voters can not always control who their electors vote for and voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

Moreover, in source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor... state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people...electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."". Furthermore, this shows how the citizens of the United States of America really don't have a direct, liberal,voting system to choose who they want to won the election because at anypoint the electors can just go against what the citizens want and vote for who they please.

Lastly, Plumer states, ""the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each states, candidates don't spend time in each state because they know they hvae no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."". Basically,this is saying that small states don't get to see campaigns or any of that because they're small states so they don't evem get a visit from the elector.

Overall, The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. We should all have the right to vote for who we want directly and not have to go through electors which there is a very high chance they might change their minds and vote for the other party.",0
"Dear state senator, I wish to inform you about my opinion and another 60 percent of voters opinions about the Electoral college. We suggest that instead of voting for a state of electors we should vote directly to the president that we wish would lead our country. People wan't to vote straight cowardly to the exact person they perfer and not to electors whom the people can't control who they decide to vote for. Some electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whoever they wanted to instead. Many people often get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. We also cannot choose who the electors are.

We know that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that the electors that they choose always defy the will of the people. Many things can go wrong when we use electors. They could cheat into getting who they want to win. Just like how in 1960, the segregationists the the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in their dirty plan to replace the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy meaning that they tried to get the popular vote that was for him to actually not get to Kennedy. Also, a state might send two slates of electors to congress. It's happened in Hawaii in 1960, what makes you think it won't happen again?

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of all the ways electors cheat to make sure who they wan't wins. candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. Also 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see any campaign adds and its because of the winnertakeall system in each state.

We suggest to changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The citizens of the United states should be able to vote for the president that they perfer and not for an elector that could ditch the original idea and vote for only their personal opinion. There would be less flaws in the presidential electing process if we accept the popular vote method.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where innovative approaches to transportation have had positive effects. By reducing car dependency, these communities have managed to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, they contribute up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban and during the car-free day in Bogota, these communities are effectively reducing their carbon footprint and helping to combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. In Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is restricted, 70 percent of families do not own cars. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, the streets in Vauban are quiet and free of traffic. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also reduces the time wasted in traffic and the stress associated with driving.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. Vauban, for example, has prioritized walking and biking by placing stores within walking distance and creating extensive bicycle paths. This encourages residents to engage in physical activity and leads to numerous health benefits. Similarly, during the car-free day in Bogota, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior.

Finally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban due to smog. However, this can be seen as an opportunity for alternative modes of transportation, such as bike and pedestrian couriers, to thrive. By diversifying the transportation industry and reducing dependence on cars, there is potential for job creation and economic growth.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. It improves air quality, reduces traffic congestion, promotes active lifestyles, and can have economic benefits. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and provide inspiration for other communities to adopt similar practices. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change and urbanization, reevaluating our car dependency and embracing alternative modes of transportation is crucial.",1
"Every four years, the United States is turned into a political battleground by the campaign for presidency. The electoral College, the voting method used since the nation began, Is being highly questioned on its efficiency now vs the efficiency 250 years ago. However, the system has survived because it works. Despite its flaws, the Electoral College does a good job of simplifying the presidential election and eliminating disputes or a potential crisis. It produces a clear winner, it makes sure that the president is popular in all areas of the country, and it puts the weight of the campaign on the swing states.

In most presidentai races, the president wins only by a small margin. rarely is there a landslide victory or a complete vote for a president. This small majority can lead to many disputes over the credibility of counting the votes in the individual states. This is why the Electoral College helps the voting process. The Electoral College helps the voting process because it produces a more clear winner. For example, in line 21 it claims that ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney"". This shows that while the popluar vote can be extremely tight, the winner gaining sometimes less than 1 percent of the popluar votes, the Electoral College helps the system by giving the winner a landslide advantage and therefore clearing up any claims over the credibility of the popular votes which the loser can produce. Also, the Electoral College helps prevent the situation of no president winning the majority of the votes. the introduction of third parties can sometimes mean that no party gains more than half of the votes. However, the Electoral College helps deal with that situation. In 1968 and 1992, Nixon and Clinton both had less than the majority, but won because they had the Electoral College in their favor. This is why the Electoral College still works today.

There are some areas of the nation that are very highly populated. The southern and western regions of the nation are becoming more and more populated, and the northern regions are diminishing in size. By popular vote, a president who wins the southern regions alone would have a good chance of winning the nation. However, that system does not work under the electoral college vote. The Electoral College is a good system for voting on the president because it requires a president to be popular across the nation. Under the Electoral College, a president can not suffice by winning the votes in a couple of states. They must get points from states across the nation and then will it add up to a victory. This is good because a president with only a regional majority will mainly focus on the region which he is based on. The other regions will be disregarded, and not paid as much attention to. The Electoral College prevents this outcome. This is another reason why the Electoral College is a good method of picking the presidency.

Most states will have a tendency to almost always vote for a particular party. The real difference in Electoral votes lies mostly in the states who will vote either way, or swing States"". The Electoral College is a good thing because it puts the emphasis on the states who will vote either way, ensuring the credibility of the candidate. These swing states know that they are the ones who decide the election. Therefore, it is the voters in these states who pay more attention to the campaign, who research the candidates more, and who listen to what the candidates have to say. This is a bonus for the Electoral College because it means that the candidate who will be elected is the candidate who will do best for the country, not necessarily the most popular. Because of this, the Electoral College should remain the system of voting on the presidency.

There are arguments that the Electoral College should be abolished. That the system of sending electors to congress to vote for them does not work because they can't guarantee that the electors will vote for who they are supposed to do. However, the chances of that happening today and the elector getting away with it are very slim. Today, The people and the government know exactly how much votes each state gave to each candidate, and they know exactly how much electoral votes a candidate should get. So even if you manage to add a vote to your candidate, It's very likely that someone will do the math and figure out that something's not right with the votes.

Like every system, the Electoral College has its flaws. However, the system is the best we can put in place to elect a new president. The system still is used after 250 years because it easily simplifies the disputes that can easily occur over the tight popular vote margins. So the next time you vote for the president, You'll know that you are voting in the most efficient democratic system to date.",0

"Limiting car usage has several advantages that should be considered for the benefit of society. As highlighted in the passage set, reducing car usage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate pollution, and improve overall quality of life.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By minimizing the number of cars on the road, we can directly contribute to achieving goals related to curbing emissions and combating climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help reduce pollution. In the passage about Paris, it is mentioned that smog levels in the city were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The reliance on cars, especially those running on diesel fuel, contributes to poor air quality and negatively impacts public health. Implementing measures to limit car usage, such as partial driving bans or designated car-free days, can significantly improve air quality and reduce the burden of respiratory diseases.

Furthermore, adopting a car-free lifestyle can enhance the overall quality of life in communities. The passage on the German suburb of Vauban highlights how residents who have given up their cars are happier and experience less stress. Living in car-free neighborhoods promotes a sense of community and encourages alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling. Additionally, having fewer cars on the streets reduces traffic congestion and creates safer, more walkable environments.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to advancements in urban planning and transportation infrastructure. As mentioned in the passage on Vauban, smart planning involves placing stores within walking distance and making suburbs more accessible to public transportation. This approach not only reduces the need for private vehicles but also encourages healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact society. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating pollution, improving overall quality of life, and promoting sustainable urban planning, we can create healthier, more environmentally friendly communities. It is crucial for citizens and policymakers to recognize these benefits and work towards implementing measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce reliance on cars.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to urge you to support the preservation of this system for electing the President of the United States. While there are strong arguments on both sides, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process and serves to protect the interests of all citizens and regions.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights in his article, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the outcome of the election is clearer and less likely to be disputed, reducing the risk of prolonged legal battles and political turmoil.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in electing the President. Judge Posner argues that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, as they may neglect the interests and concerns of other regions. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just certain pockets of support.

In addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and pay attention to the concerns of these states. As Judge Posner explains, voters in swing states are more likely to be thoughtful and informed, as they carry the weight of deciding the election. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are more likely to address the concerns of the swing voters, resulting in a more engaged electorate and a president responsive to the needs of a broad range of Americans.

The Electoral College also serves to balance the influence of large and small states. While the popular vote would give disproportionate weight to heavily populated states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to states with smaller populations. By restoring some weight to the political balance, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must take into account the concerns and interests of all states, regardless of size.

Finally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, providing stability and avoiding the complications that would arise from run-off elections. This allows for a smooth and efficient election process, ensuring that the will of the people is upheld.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, I believe that these practical advantages outweigh the concerns. The Electoral College upholds the principles of our federal system, ensures that candidates address the concerns of all regions, and promotes stability in presidential elections.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I hope that you will support the retention of the Electoral College as part of our democratic process. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further or require any additional information.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, I firmly believe that it is in the best interest of our nation to maintain the Electoral College system. Though there are arguments in favor of both systems, the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

One of the fundamental reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated in the passage by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the result of the election is decisive and minimizes the possibility of lengthy legal disputes. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to close elections with no clear winner, which could potentially necessitate time-consuming and costly run-off elections.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents a broader range of interests and appeals to a wide spectrum of voters. As Judge Posner points out, the requirement for trans-regional appeal means that candidates must appeal to voters from different regions, rather than focusing solely on winning the most populated areas. This prevents candidates from neglecting the needs and concerns of certain regions, promoting a more balanced representation across the country.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in swing states and adopt policies that address the concerns of these states. Judge Posner correctly notes that voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and candidates, as they have a greater influence on the outcome. This leads to a more engaged and informed electorate and ensures that candidates do not solely prioritize the interests of heavily democratic or republican states.

Moreover, the Electoral College gives smaller states a fairer representation. By providing each state with a minimum number of electors based on their representation in Congress, the system ensures that smaller states are not overshadowed by the larger ones. As mentioned by Judge Posner, this balance of power prevents large states from dominating the election process and guarantees a more equal distribution of attention and resources from presidential candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This eliminates the potential for extended election processes and allows for a clear winner to be determined promptly. This certainty and efficiency are essential for maintaining the stability and continuity of our democracy.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for both the Electoral College and a popular vote system, the benefits provided by the Electoral College cannot be ignored. It ensures a decisive outcome, promotes broader representation, encourages candidates to address the concerns of swing states, safeguards the interests of smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. As such, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in the best interest of our nation.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will weigh all the arguments carefully before making a decision that will impact our electoral system.

Sincerely,

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. As evidenced by the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota, there are significant benefits to reducing car dependency and promoting alternative modes of transportation. These advantages include improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less traffic congestion, and healthier and more sustainable communities.

One of the most immediate benefits of limiting car usage is improved air quality. In many cities, such as Paris, smog levels have reached dangerous levels due to car emissions. By implementing driving bans like the one enforced in Paris, the number of cars on the road decreases, leading to a significant reduction in air pollution. This not only protects the health of residents but also helps combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Speaking of greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage is essential in the fight against climate change. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars responsible for a significant proportion of these emissions. By encouraging alternatives to car usage, such as public transportation, walking, and cycling, we can reduce our carbon footprint and work towards a more sustainable future.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. As illustrated in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day can lead to empty streets and a smoother flow of traffic. This not only saves time for commuters but also has economic benefits, as fewer cars on the road means less fuel consumption and wear and tear on infrastructure. Additionally, by encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as buses and bicycles, we can reduce the demand for private cars, further alleviating congestion.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can contribute to the development of healthier and more sustainable communities. In the case of Vauban, Germany, the absence of cars has led to a more pedestrian-friendly environment, with streets filled with bicycles and the sounds of children playing. This encourages physical activity and social interaction, fostering a sense of community. Additionally, by designing communities with alternative modes of transportation in mind, such as placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation access, we create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, both for individuals and the environment. By reducing air pollution, combating climate change, alleviating traffic congestion, and promoting healthier and more sustainable communities, we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. It is crucial that we continue to embrace smart planning and alternative transportation options to reap these benefits and ensure a more sustainable and livable world.",1
"Cars have been around for awhile and they have had a major impact on society. Many people believe that there is no problem with the frequency of cars being driven. But, there are many advantages to less car use such as improving our cities and suburbs, improving safety, and decreasing pollution.

Many have tried to make cities a little more dense and better for walking but nothing has seemed to work therefore, they have moved on to suburbs. Now, people are trying to make suburbs better for getting around while walking instead of driving. By doing so, places such as shops will be made closer and more convenient which allows people to be able to consider walking as a better option. By having these suburbs, and soon hopefully cities, reduce the amount of cars used, the people living in these areas will be able to accomplish more in a healthier and safer way.

Safety has been an issue in almost all areas due to a variety of reasons one being cars. People pass by ""Drive Safely"" signs or memorials on the side of the road too often. Many accidents occur because of all the cars and traffic and careless driving. By reducing the amount of cars being driven, the moment of deaths in car accidents can be reduced as well. In ""The End of Car Culture"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""Mine 19 and 21 have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" Recently, teenagers who are able to get their license haven't really made it a priority. This could be caused by factors such as fear of driving or just because they've figured out a way around driving. Not everyone needs a car to get around there are plenty of other ways to safely get from point A to point B.

Another large issue cars contribute to is pollution. Pollution is in every city, every state, every country, every continent. Cars are ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe..."" Rosenthal, Elisabeth, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"". Cars don't help with environmental issues whatsoever. They add to the smog issues and they increase the about of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the capital of France, for example, congestion was down sixty percent due to smog causing delivery companies to lose money since they couldn't delieve what was needed. Cars are extremely harmful to the environment and they make the issues we already have even larger. By limiting car usage, people could hopefully work on repairing the damage we have already done to the environment instead of worsening it.

Cars have impacted society ever since they were made. By reducing the amount of cars driven, cities and suburbs can be improved, better safety can be implimented, and pollution will reduce. Until then, the issues cars create will continue to get worse and by the time people see it, the problems will be too late to fix.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have significant advantages for individuals and communities. This is evident from the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, where initiatives to reduce car dependence have been successful.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars contribute significantly to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, the figure can go up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, emissions can be greatly reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where the concentration of cars is high.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for individuals. In Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, residents report being happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. They enjoy walking and cycling in car-free streets, where there is less noise and pollution. Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to increased physical activity, as people are more likely to walk or cycle for shorter trips, improving their overall health and well-being.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can provide economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. This shows that reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to smoother traffic flow and less time wasted in traffic jams. In turn, this can boost productivity and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation such as public transit and cycling, cities can reduce the need for expensive road infrastructure and parking spaces, saving money in the long run.

Finally, limiting car usage can promote social cohesion and community engagement. In Bogota, the car-free day encourages millions of people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as buses, bikes, or walking. This creates a sense of unity and shared experience among residents, as they witness empty streets devoid of traffic jams. It also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, as people are encouraged to engage in physical activities instead of relying solely on cars for transportation.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to enhancing quality of life, promoting economic benefits, and fostering social cohesion, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on individuals and communities. Initiatives like those seen in Vauban, Paris, and Bogota provide valuable examples of how reducing car dependence can lead to a better and more sustainable future.",1
"Sometimes things need to change but not in this case. Im in favor of keeping the Electoral College, normally in situations like this you have to choose one way or the other. Not with this, the electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote as stated in Source one. I know that wasnt enough to convince you so let me explain my reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college. My reasons are certainty of outcome and it can avoid runoff elections.

To begin I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us certainty of an outcome. One of the reasons why this is possible is because there is a total of five hundred and thirty eight votes and thats an even number so it can happen. Many people might say what are the chances of that happening. Well it actually happens a few years ago back in twothousand. One of the reasons for this as stated in Source three paragraph eighteen is ""that the winning candidates share of Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" As an example from the article Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis. I hope that this information has been able to push you to my side a little more but were still not done. This is one of my reasons why I think that we should keep the Electoral Vote.

Finally I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it can avoid any run off elections. This is good because it solves the problem of elections in which no canadite receives a majority of the votes cast. Some people might try to convince you and ask you what are the chances of this happening and has it ever occurred before? Well I can answer both yes it can happen and it has twice, ounce in nineteen sixty eight with Nixon and a second time in nineteen ninty two with Clinton. Both had a forty three percent pluarity of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters. But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ""this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us a certainty of an outcome and also it avoids run off elections. I know there are alot of decisions to be made and many things to consider but without this Electoral College we are in big trouble and more problems than you can fathom are going to happen. But in the end this is your decison hopefully you make the right one.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is an emerging trend in many parts of the world, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Several case studies illustrate the advantages of limiting car usage, such as the car-free district of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By adopting smart planning strategies, reducing dependency on cars, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, cities and communities can benefit from cleaner air, reduced congestion, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, particularly passenger cars, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times article, cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and combating climate change. The case of Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars, demonstrates how a car-free lifestyle can significantly reduce carbon footprints.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality and Public Health
Vehicular emissions are a major source of air pollution, especially in densely populated cities. The driving ban in Paris due to smog, as reported by the Chicago Tribune, resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This temporary measure brought about a 60% decrease in congestion and highlighted the negative health effects of car usage. By limiting car usage, communities can enjoy cleaner air, reduce respiratory illnesses, and promote overall public health.

Body Paragraph 3: Reduced Congestion and Enhanced Livability
The introduction of car-free districts and car-free days, such as the ones in Vauban and Bogota respectively, showcase the potential for reduced congestion and enhanced livability. These initiatives create space for alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transit. The Seattle Times article on Bogota's car-free day highlights how millions of Colombians experienced a day devoid of traffic jams, promoting efficient transportation and a better urban environment. Additionally, car-free districts result in walkable communities with improved access to amenities like shops, schools, and parks.

Body Paragraph 4: Economic Benefits and Diverse Transportation Options 
Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The New York Times article mentions how car ownership rates have declined even before the recession, indicating a broader cultural shift. This shift led companies like Ford and Mercedes to rebrand themselves as mobility companies with diverse product ranges beyond personal vehicles. By embracing alternative transportation options like car-sharing programs, bike-sharing, and public transit, communities enable residents to save money on transportation costs, reduce the need for parking spaces, and reduce the strain on infrastructure.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. Case studies from across the world demonstrate the significant impact of reducing car dependency, from reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality to reduced congestion and enhanced livability. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation, and rethinking the car-centric culture, communities can create sustainable, healthy, and accessible urban environments for all. Embracing these changes will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the global effort to address climate change and build a better future.",1
"when looking at the world from a birds eye view, it is possible to see the beauty in the world Even so, in certain developed and developing areas, the people are choking. The choking is not just supported by the violated environment, but along with that, society is an advocate for the pain of the people. An intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars. With the progressing world also comes regress, and according to an article written by the New york times in 2013, it was stated that in countries such as the United states of America, ""Americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the U.S.A. Although the car industry may suffer from this, it is essential to note that, the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public. In fact, in the long run, the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole. This can be seen in three major ways, with first, public benefits , second, cheaper and timesaving methods , and finally the unmatched environmental benefits.

As people continue to choke from the pain, it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem, and limiting car usage is the definitely one of the best ways to reduce the harms. The public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress , more space , and increased safety. Starting off with stress, Heidrun Walter, a mother of two children stated that she was ""always tense"" when she had a car. she now lives in the German city of Vauban. Here most people have given up on cars, including Mrs. Walter. As a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation. With Mrs. Walter, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". These people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit. Moving toward space, an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in 2009, states in this new approach, we will have make it so there is less space for parking. With less space for cars, there is more space for people. Not only that but with the increased limit, there is a decrease in traffic. Traffic can be extremely long, and in this case it will help to increase public space. Although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety, in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat. Therefore, with their limit, there can be an increase in safety for the people. Moving back to Mrs. Walter, she as a mother of two did want the best for her children, and above all comes their safety. Meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces.

Although people do want to benefit as individuals, it really comes down to the cost at the end point. But limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person. In fact, by limiting cars, alternate transportation is promoted. Countries such as Colombia, have move on to bicycles. The major of Bogotaa city in colombia said that due to the limitation of cars for a day ""It has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"". This is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars. This means that transport would be so much more affordable. Now with the increase in bicycle travel, there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic. And although cars are much faster than bicycles, the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel, bicycle travel will be more efficient. This ultimately means that by limiting car usage, transportation will be cheaper, and it will be just as efficient, if not more. It can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel, but David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80% of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes. By limiting car usage, these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation. Indeed in the end Vauban is correct in calling this ""smart planning"".

Now comes out the benefits everyone knows about: the environmental benefits. Smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world. In countries such as China, it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog, daily. But what may not be as common to people is that a country such as France has also started to see a similiar problem. Pollution in France is actually rivaled by Beijingone of the most polluted countries in the world as reported by the Chicago tribune on 2014. Cars have been the major cause of this, considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by cars. In fact an article named ""The end of car culture"" states that cars are one of the highest sources for carbon emissions. By limiting car usage, cities such as Bogota and Paris, faced amazing results. Overall by limiting car usage the environment benefits exponentially.

In the end the solution to the people choking in the world, is simple: limiting car usage. The advantages of this limitation can be seen with benefits to socitey. This can be seen with public benefits, cheaper and time saving methods and of course the environmental benefits.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as a method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for the election of the president by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and balanced system that ensures a more accurate representation of the American people.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system in most states, which guarantees a clear mandate for the president-elect. This certainty helps to avoid disputes and potential crises that could arise from a close popular vote, as was seen in the controversial 2000 election.

Another important point in favor of the Electoral College is the principle of ""everyone's president."" This system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, ensuring that no single region or group dominates the election. This encourages candidates to campaign in all regions of the country and gives all Americans a sense of representation. If the president were elected solely by popular vote, candidates might focus only on densely populated areas or regions that align with their party's ideology, potentially leaving large sections of the country feeling unheard and unrepresented.

The Electoral College also gives weight to swing states, which holds several benefits. By focusing campaign efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, candidates must consider the interests and concerns of those voters. This attention to swing states encourages candidates to present more nuanced and comprehensive policies that address the needs of diverse communities across the country. Furthermore, swing states generate more engagement and participation from citizens, as they understand that their votes could have a significant impact on the outcome of the election.

Additionally, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. While the popular vote could favor the interests and concerns of densely populated states, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states are not left out. By granting each state a minimum of three electoral votes (representing their senators), the system ensures that candidates must consider the concerns of all states. This is particularly important in ensuring fairness and representation for states with smaller populations.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can be time-consuming and expensive. By consistently producing a clear winner, the Electoral College streamlines the election process and allows for a smoother transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in non-competitive states, it is important to note that voter turnout has remained relatively high despite this perceived issue. Additionally, every vote is still important, as it contributes to the popular vote totals and can influence the allocation of electoral votes in a state.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a time-tested system that balances the interests and concerns of diverse regions, states, and populations. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, gives weight to swing states, balances the influence of big and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages make it an effective and fair method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in order to maintain a system that best represents the interests and values of all Americans.

Sincerely,

"Having a car can be very stressful and cost a lot of money. Not only does having a car hurt our earth but it hurts your wallet or you can hurt other people. Also you can get so much more exercise from just walking to where you need to go than taking your car. It seems difficulty to live without your car but they show that some people can do it , so can you.

You just moved into your new home in Vauban , Germany. You have to pay money just to park your car. In the article ""In german suburb, life goes on without cars."" According to Elisabeth Rosenthal , it states in paragraph 2 that ""Car ownership is allowed , but there ar only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."" So if you want to park your car , you have to pay just to keep it there and always pay for your house.

Think of all the people that have cars , take buses , basically anything with an engine is polluting our earth. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" according the writer , Robert Duffer it states in paragraph 10 that ""After days of nearrecord pollution , Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" They almost broke a record of so much pollution and the main reason of that is because of cars. So if you have less people driving them , the less polluted our world with be.

Instead of driving just everywhere , you can get exricse and move your body to the place you need to go. Not only is it healthy for your body and life , its healthy for our world. In the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" The author Andrew Selsky stated in paragraph 20 that ""In a program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" They got where the needed to go , without their car. So just on that one day , they helped out our world and themselves.

In conclusion , having no car is just better for everyone. You get to save so much money on gas or not having to pay for a parking spot. Our world is not as polluted with all thr smoke and gas that cars cause. You get to get exercise for the day and feel better. If you can go a day with no car , you can live your life with no car. So help save the world and your wallet by not using a car.",0
"Now and days, our world has transformed from using simple transportation to one source: the automobile. However, recent studies have shown our slow progression for the past years, discovering other ways of getting to point A to point B by having programs, reducing pollution and smog along the way, and living in an affordable economy.

To begin with, cities in our world have proven to be ""carfree cities"" by allowing programs to show other ways of transportation and reducing pollution and smog along the way. In Bogota, Colombia, a program where it is ""a car free day"", millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work and as Enrique rivera mentions in source 3, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution paragraph 24"". Colombia has been hosting this program since the 1990's and it has spread around the world the influence Colombia has done is beyond incredible. Although the program is not held everyday, it impacts the world slowly. Also, in source 2, the usage of car in France has decreased drastically because of the ""intensifying smog paragraph 14"". Because their tax policy ""favors diesel over gasoline paragraph 16"", they're required to use diesel, but the French decide to rebel to save the environment, in result causing delivery companies to complain. Although, because the French did use less cars it made the smog clear up. In all, programs such as the one held in Colombia influence all arts of the world with showing other ways of transportation and even saving the environment.

In addition, the world continues to reduce the use of cars because it becomes more affordable to the people. When the economy crashed in the United State's, people relied on their cars, until they realized it was too expensive to pay gas, pay parking, but needed an alternative and as it says in source 4, ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit...paragraph 36"". People do not want to go back to a car based economy. They're finding other affordable sources. Not only does the usage of cars affect people financially, but also emotionally. In Vauban, Germany, as a result of forbidding street parking, house garages and fee's, 70 percent of the famalies do not own cars and Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, who usually bikes, expesses herself about the situation in source 1, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Clearly, the use of less cars result in a finacial plus and an emotional change as well.

In conclusion, ""car free days"" are much more effective in a way that demonstrates the world other options of transportation, an opportunity to save the enoviroment, and an affordable economy to all.",0
"When one thinks of transportation, the first idea that springs into a persons mind would be a car. A car is used almost daily for many people. It helps us get to point A to point B rain or shine. However, complications arise from the use or overuse of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage includes reduction in pollution, promote public transport, and cut off traffic.

Pollution has become a growing problem as the world continues to industrialized. The greenhouse gases emitted by machines, such as cars, have been proven detrimental to the environment. In cardense cities, smog, a mixture of smoke and fog, has become a nuisance as it covers cities. In extreme cases,it makes the air citizens breathe toxic! According to Source 1, "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."". To establish limits to car usage would then, therefore, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and clear up conditions not only for the world, but make the overall city more enjoyable to live in. In order to reduce pollution and clear the air, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the international city. Source 2 states that "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban..."" proving that limiting car usage benefitted the city and the environment as well.

Reduction of car usage would lead to the promotion of public transportation. Public transport was free of charge during the ban in Paris which stated was a success in reducing pollution. Limiting car usage would then correlate in the promotion of public transport which, according to Source 4, ""...public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions of greenhouse gases and improve safety"" This not only benefits one's safety and environment but allows timeefficient traveling as buses and other public transport run along a contiuous schedule. Public transport also produces carpooling, which allows the reduction of cars on the road. This also eliminates a distributor in the production of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere which benefits the world.

Limiting car usage will take one annoying factor from our daily lives traffic. As a suburban citizen living in Florida, traffic has become a daily nuisance of mine, one that not only is frusterating but stressful. It wastes time that I need to invest in being somewhere of importance. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars in their experimental new district near the French and Swiss borders. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Paris, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" during their ban in response to reduce pollution. This would make the lives of many citizens much more happier and time efficient as there are no worries about arrving late to an area of importance!

Limiting car usage in many large cities accross the globe is not impossible, it has been done successfully in globally impactful cities such as Paris. This reduction of cars will not only benefit a community or a city, but the whole world! It will reduce pollution, promote the usage of public transport and carpooling and cut down on the rushhour traffic leaving condtions in cities much more enjoyable to live in.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
The growing trend of limiting car usage in various parts of the world is gaining attention due to its positive impact on the environment and quality of life. By adopting smart planning and promoting alternative transportation methods, communities are revolutionizing the way they function. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage, focusing on reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced access to public transportation and community spaces.

Paragraph 1: Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Car ownership and usage contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, which is a major concern in tackling climate change. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. Limiting car usage in suburban areas, such as Vauban, Germany, can help to mitigate these emissions. Vauban's innovative approach, which restricts car ownership and emphasizes public transportation, serves as an example for other communities to follow.

Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality
In densely populated cities like Paris, where car pollution reaches dangerous levels, limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality. Robert Duffer's article on Paris' partial driving ban highlights how restricting car access led to a 60 percent reduction in congestion and a decline in smog levels. By implementing measures such as license plate-based driving bans and promoting alternative transportation options, cities can create cleaner and healthier environments for their citizens.

Paragraph 3: Enhanced Access to Public Transportation and Community Spaces
Limiting car usage also leads to greater accessibility to public transportation and community spaces. Elisabeth Rosenthal's article highlights how Vauban, Germany places stores within walking distance instead of distant malls. By adopting this approach, communities can encourage residents to use public transportation and engage in healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation, like walking or cycling. Additionally, as seen in Bogota, Colombia, car-free days provide an opportunity for people to explore alternative transportation methods, while promoting a sense of community and reducing traffic congestion. Andrew Selsky's article notes that these car-free days have become a significant event, inspiring millions to embrace alternative transportation options.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage offers several advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced access to public transportation and community spaces. Communities worldwide are recognizing the importance of transitioning from car-centric planning to more sustainable and people-friendly approaches. By adopting these measures, we can create healthier and more sustainable cities that prioritize the well-being of both the environment and citizens.",1
"I remember thee stories my dad use to tell me about how in cuba he would have to walk 6 miles to get to school. Or when he got here theat to work he would ride his bike to & from work. Cars are being put into use for no reason, people now a days go in thee car to to thee winn dixie theats right across thee street. Do you know how much money is put into cars? you have to pay for gas, or if your car breaks down or has a leak. Cars are a huge investment and theey are very dangerous to our society, thee pollution cars cause i horrendous. Now don't get me wrong I would prefer to go in a car on a 3 hour ride to Orlando from Naples, i mean who would want to walk 1000s of miles? but to get in thee car to get dropped off at school when you live 5 minutes away? theats ridiculous.

In Germany car use has been dropping and it has proven to provide a cleaner environment, healtheier living and huge savings. Near thee French and Swiss borders, it is forbidden to have hoe garages, street parking and drive ways. The streets are considered to be carfree zone. There are a few streets theat cars are allowed, you can park in a larage car garage or at thee edge of a development. But thee parkng space is not free thee parking space in 40,000, along withe a home. Obviously theat price is alittle bit pricey for people so 70% of theeses families do not own cars and 50% acctually sold a car to be able to live theere. The environmental Protection Agency is strongly trying to promote reducing cars andor car usage all theroughout thee united states.

What comes to your head when you theink about Paris? love, romance, coffee shops, expensive dinners on thee effie tower. How about pollution, having to stay inside because thee healthe concerns? Paris has recently banned driving due to thee pollution revolving the city of love. Motorists ere requested to leave theeir cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine, to some people thee 31 dollars did not effect theem so theey kept driving and were fined. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had theere cars impounded due to inappropriate reaction to recieving theis fine. After 5 days of what frances citizens would call torture 60% of congestion was down, believe it or not Paris was rivaling Beijing, China known for having one of thee most polluted streets in thee world! The blame was put on diesel fuel, 67% of frances cars use diesel engines. Paris has moresmog thean otheer european capitals like london or brussels. Imagine how much clearer Paris would be if theis car ban lasted a year!

Imagine how nice it would be to have zero traffic, no rush to get home. but how would you feel if thee reason behind theis traffic free day you had to ride a bike or go on thee bus? you would probably take theat traffic over a little exercise or having to stand next to a stranger. In Bogota, Colombia thee have a event called ""a carfree day"" in theis day colombians all gatheered as theey skated, biked or rode thee bus to get to theeir destination. If you violated theis you would have to fance a 25 dollar fine. The goalpf theis even was to promote alternative transportation but to also hope for less smog. During theis day not even rain could stop theese colombians from participating in theis event. Some people saw theis as a save thee world act also to relieve stress.

Cars are a way to travel long distances and should be used every once in a while but thee world is asking you please put an end to theis, use of cars for every little theing, start to set a goal to live a happier healtheier life and create a safe eviorment by ending car use, Start small like riding a bycicle to thee grocery store, theen decide to take a walk to thee neighbors right around thee street.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

As our cities become increasingly crowded and our planet faces the threat of climate change, it is becoming clear that we need to find alternatives to our car-dependent lifestyles. Limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation can have several advantages for individuals and society as a whole. This essay will discuss the benefits of limiting car usage based on information from the passages provided.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some areas of the United States. By reducing car usage, we can make a significant impact in reducing our carbon footprint and combating climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The passages mention several instances where cities had to implement driving bans or car-free days due to smog and high levels of pollution. These measures resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and an improvement in air quality. For example, in Paris, congestion decreased by 60% after a partial driving ban was enforced. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can create cleaner and healthier cities.

Limiting car usage also has benefits for individuals. The passages mention that residents of car-free communities reported being happier and less stressed compared to when they owned cars. This is supported by the experience of residents in Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars. One resident stated, “When I had a car I was always tense. I’m much happier this way.” By relying less on cars, individuals can enjoy the benefits of less traffic, more walkable neighborhoods, and a more active and healthy lifestyle.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible neighborhoods. The passages mention the concept of ""smart planning"" in which suburbs are designed to be less dependent on cars and more accessible to public transportation. This includes placing stores within walking distance and creating compact communities. This approach not only reduces the need for cars but also promotes a sense of community and interaction among residents.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, and creates healthier and more connected communities. It also leads to less traffic congestion and can contribute to individuals' happiness and well-being. It is time to rethink our car-dependent lifestyles and embrace alternative modes of transportation for a sustainable and livable future.",1
"The use of cars has always affected society greatly. There are plans constantly being added to better the environment without the use of cars. Vauban, mentioned in Source 1, can be the start of the carless world we want to live in. As this experiment becomes noticed by the world, communities will realize how beneficial this experiment could be. Think about a world with no cars. There would be less pollution and less gasses being emitted into the air. For example, Pairs has just banned driving due to heavy smog. After about five days, car traffic was down 60 percent. Limiting car usage should be implemented heavily because of the greenhouse gas emissions and the happiness of the citizens of Vauban.

To begin with, cars cause many problems and the most important being the emissions of greenhouse gasses. As seen in Source 1, some of the car fillled cities of the United States suffer from up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Wellpopulated cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago could be in great danger. A highly populated city in Colombia, has a ""CarFree"" day. The goal of this is to allow people to open their eyes and realized how many alternative ways there are to go to work. The implemented a fee of 25 dollars to anyone who violated. I think that by adding a fee, the outcome would be greater and more people would participate. This is a great idea that would open people up to other options. For example, on the third year of the car free day, two other cities joined Bogota. Sometimes we have to open up the eyes of others to really see the change. Also, parks and recreational areas have opened up, uneven sidewalks have been refurbished, and most importantly the city has less traffic.

Continuing with pollution, Paris had a nearrecord of pollution, seen in Source 2. This led to the ban of driving. The ban of driving could be refered to as the limiting of driving. They set up a plan in which cars with evennumbered license plates couldn't drive on Mondays. The same occurred for the oddnumbered license plates on Tuesday. They heavily enforced this by implementing a fine of 22 euros if they used their cars. This idea could work here in America. It would open up carpooling and lessen the amount of cars on the road.

People such as David Goldberg, mentioned in Source 1, are pushing for cities to be less dependent on cars. Mr. Goldberg mentions the hybrid car. Even though buying a hybrid does not reduce the amount of cars, it does reduce the amount of green house gas emissions.

Seeing the happiness and comfort that the people of Vauban allows us to see what our society could look like. We could live in a society just like theirs, filled with nature. In the United States, the number of licenses has been going down each year. Now, this does not automatically mean that American citizens want to ""be green"". It could be simply because of the fact that cars are expensive, and because we are living in a rough situation. In conclusion, I believe that we should limit car usage for the advantages of less pollution and less greenhouse gasses.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

I am writing to express my support for keeping the current Electoral College system in place for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote method, I believe that the Electoral College provides several key benefits that are essential for our democracy.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in the Office of the Federal Register's text, a dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that all regions have a say in the election. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents candidates from solely focusing on their stronghold regions. This encourages candidates to campaign and listen to the concerns of voters across the country, promoting national unity and inclusivity.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages meaningful engagement from voters. The focus on swing states, as seen in the 2012 election, leads to more attention being given to these states by candidates, resulting in voters being more informed and thoughtful in their decision-making process. This engagement and active participation are crucial to a well-functioning democracy.

The Electoral College also provides a balance of power between small and large states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance to large states, which can lose influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, ensuring their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections could significantly complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner, maintaining a streamlined and efficient election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than to swing the outcome of the entire election. The high voter turnout in the 2012 election, despite knowing their vote may not have a national impact, demonstrates the commitment of the American population to express their political preferences.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty, regional balance, meaningful engagement, power balance between states, and avoids run-off elections. These benefits are essential for a successful and fair presidential election process. I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating the debate on whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system. Maintaining the Electoral College is vital to preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic process.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my views on this important matter.

Sincerely,

Subject: In Support of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the selection of the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves a crucial role in our presidential elections. In making this argument, I will address the criticisms of the Electoral College and present evidence from multiple sources to support my claims.

One of the primary arguments against the Electoral College is its lack of democratic principles. Critics argue that the winner-take-all system in each state leads to candidates focusing only on swing states, thereby ignoring the interests of other states and voters. However, Judge Richard A. Posner contends that the Electoral College ensures that a candidate has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must work to gain support from various regions of the country. This requirement fosters a sense of national representation and prevents candidates from solely catering to specific regions. As a result, the Electoral College promotes a more united and balanced approach to campaigning.

Moreover, the winner-take-all method employed by the Electoral College incentivizes candidates to focus their campaigns on swing states. According to Judge Posner, voters in these toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful decisions regarding their vote. This dynamic ensures that those who invest effort into understanding the candidates and their policies have a greater impact on the outcome of the election. Ultimately, this system promotes an engaged and informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College addresses the concern of smaller states having less influence in the election. Judge Posner explains that the Electoral College restores some political balance by giving weighted attention to larger states. This system ensures that candidates cannot overlook the concerns and interests of states with smaller populations. By granting electoral votes based on a state's representation in Congress, the Electoral College values the diverse perspectives of both large and small states.

Critics of the Electoral College also argue that it can result in an outcome where the popular vote winner does not win the presidency. It is important to note, however, that such instances have been rare throughout history. The Office of the Federal Register outlines that since 1888, there has only been one such occurrence, which happened in 2000. Furthermore, the Electoral College provides certainty in the outcome, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote due to winner-take-all rules. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital mechanism in our democracy to elect the President of the United States. It ensures trans-regional appeal, encourages campaigns to focus on swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and reduces the need for run-off elections. While some have criticized the system, the evidence from multiple sources, including the Office of the Federal Register and Judge Richard A. Posner, emphasizes the benefits and practicality of the Electoral College.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I urge you to continue supporting the Electoral College, which safeguards the interests of all states and voters in our nation.

Sincerely,

"In this generation, our planet is getting filthier and filthier by the day. What many people are too late to realize is that we are the main cause of our dirty planet. Cars contribute to air pollution a lot. What's the only solution to this smog filled atmosphere? There are many, but limiting car usage will definitely be beneficial and highly advantageous. Limiting car usage will help reduce air pollution significantly, and will even help humans out too.

We breathe the air in our atmosphere. When you notice that our atmosphere is as dirty as it is, you really don't want to think about what you are putting into your lungs. The amount of air pollution is an extreme amount, and if not controlled soon, we will be in danger. An advantage of limiting car usage would be that the air pollution will be benefitted, and will be getting lower hopefully. As Robert Duffer states Paris of having "" intensifying smog."" That should be very concerning news and should be a clear wake up call. Limiting car usage is definitely something our planet needs to look into. A healthier atmosphere is better than one filled with smog. The decrease of air pollution is just one of the many advantages of limiting car usage.

Limiting car usage is also advantageous by taking away stress. Many people that drive all know what the pains are of being stuck in traffic. What if you don't wake up on time and you skip taking a shower, or skip eating breakfast, and speed as fast as you can to make it to work? It causes severe stress. From that point on in the day, you literally can't concentrate or focus and you just know it is going to be a rough day. Well, limiting car usage would take some stress away. See, super slow traffic , being late to work, skipping the most important meal of the day, it all just builds up into a lot of unneeded and unwanted stress. If people don't have to deal with congested highways, they could enjoy a nice walk to their job, or ride their bicycle. Doing this would instantly take away stress. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" says Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business manSelsky. There are cities that have tried having a day with no cars. It has worked in taking away stress, as you can see. Taking a bike ride or walking instead of driving a car is also beneficial because it's exercise.

Limting car use has its benefits. People should be aware of the growing danger of air pollution, and limitng car usage will help reduce the amount of pollution. Also, it helps in taking away stress and clearing minds. It is not a bad idea to start limiting our car usage, for we will receive the benefits of decreased car usage.",0
"If we never do anything about the air pollution coming from cars will the human race last a long time? If you had to choose from killing yourself slowly or making the world healthier by walking instead of taking a car what would you choose? Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it.

Limiting car usage come along with many advantages. One advantage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31."" That is a very good choice of action because without hearing that they would have any consequences people still would have drove their cars. In source 2 it also says, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" So, by limiting car usage just by the even numbered license plates there was less smog in just one day. In source 2 it says, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" So, the success of just one day made people want to do it a second day with just the oddnumbered license plates. If they keep this up and eventually have a day where neither odd nor even numbered license plates can drive the smog will eventually clear all the way up.

Also, another advantage to limiting car usage is there won't be many traffic jams. In source 3 it says, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"" meaning that everyone got around easily without all of the congestion in the roads. In source 3 it also says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife."" Traffic jams tend to cause alot of people stress. People stress because they can't get to important places on time, they spend hours on the same highway, etc. By limiting car usage, they limit their stress and have a good day instead of being so angry just because of traffic which will help them out in the long run because alot of stress isn't good for the body.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usage. In source 4 it says, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" By just taking the little time to figure out a different, less polluting way of transportation all of these advantages come out of it.

Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. A way that I could pitch in would be to ride the school bus with everybody else instead of driving myself to school. Some advantages to that would be using less gas, saving money and carpooling so that there are less cars on the road and less air pollution, because we need the air to stay clean so we can breathe and stay alive. So by limiting car usage we can have many good things happen to our lives and to our world.",0
"Throughout time, pollution has been known to be a huge environmental problem. The excessive amount of individual car owners driving down streets is in no way helping this issue. Efforts to diminish the number of cars we see on our roads have been taking place in order to help the environment and therefore citizens as well.

It is no news that passenger cars are harmful to the environment. They release gases that pollute the air we breathe affecting not only us but the environment as a whole. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States Source 1. This realization has led to the promotion of ""carreduced"" communities by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency Source 1. But the problem is more widespread than that. Paris has acknowledged the importance of this issue after witnessing smog that rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world Source 2. Paris's solution was to enforce a driving ban in order to help clear its air. Due to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent shortly after the intensifying smog Source 2. It is a known fact that transportation is America's second largest source of emissions, therefore, limiting passenger car usage can greatly benefit the environment as well as citizens everyday lives.

Limiting car usage has not only proven to be helpful towards the environment but towards citizens as well. With a decrease in car usage comes new benefits not just to individual citizens but to communities. Less cars means less time in irritating traffic. Usually, car traffic and traffic jams leads to huge amounts of stress. This is because the idea of not getting to work is stressful not getting to work means losing money. Losing money adds even more stress. But when limiting car usage, losing money is not an issue one has to think about. Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees by stating that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Source 3. Rushhour restrictions and other efforts towards limiting car usage have cut traffic making it easier for citizens to get to their jobs Source 4. Those who choose other forms of transportation that are less harmful to the environment have even less of a problem and appear to be much happier. Heldrun Walter states that when she had a car she was always tense but now she is much happier Source 1. The evidence has proven that limiting car usage is beneficial to not only the environment but to citizens daily life as well.

Keeping a clean environment is something of major importance. If one does not take care of the environment there will seize to be a healthy environment in which to live in. Limiting car usage is a big step when it comes to keeping the environment free of pollution. Not only is it beneficial to the environment but it helps citizens live a much happier life lessening the causes of stress. Limiting car usage helps the air needed to breathe, the money coming into your pockets, and one's overall happiness.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact both individuals and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, and this movement, known as ""smart planning"", has shown great potential in improving overall quality of life and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, communities can become more compact, accessible, and environmentally friendly.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a huge impediment to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of overall air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been enforced to clear the air. During these bans, congestion has decreased significantly and the levels of smog have reduced. This not only improves the health and well-being of the residents but also creates a more pleasant and livable environment. By limiting car usage, cities can combat air pollution and create cleaner and healthier spaces for their inhabitants.

Limiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. This has created a more relaxed and stress-free atmosphere, as residents no longer have to worry about the hassles of car ownership and the constant traffic congestion. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more compact communities with walkable streets and accessible public transportation. Stores are placed closer to residential areas, making it more convenient for people to access essential services without having to rely on cars. This can have a positive impact on local businesses and economies.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities, limiting car usage can help combat climate change, promote healthier living, and create more vibrant and livable spaces. It is an essential step towards creating a sustainable future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is increasingly becoming a global trend, as countries and communities recognize the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living. The passage set provides examples from various cities and regions that have implemented measures to limit car usage and reap the benefits.

One primary advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with Europe seeing 12 percent and some areas in the United States up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to a decrease in traffic congestion. The passage describes how Paris implemented a driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This not only improves air quality but also improves the efficiency of transportation in cities. With fewer cars on the road, public transportation can operate more smoothly, allowing people to reach their destinations faster.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to healthier and more vibrant communities. The passage on Vauban, Germany, highlights the benefits of creating car-free neighborhoods. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. Residents enjoy the peace and quiet of car-free streets, with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children replacing the noise of motors. This promotes an active lifestyle, as walking and biking become the primary modes of transportation. It also creates a sense of community, as people have more opportunities to interact with each other while walking or cycling.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for economic savings. The passage mentions that Vauban only allows for two places to park cars, which cost $40,000 each. While this may seem costly, it can lead to long-term savings for individuals and communities. By relying less on cars, people can save money on fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking fees. Additionally, communities can invest the money saved from parking spaces in creating more pedestrian-friendly spaces, improving public transportation systems, and developing amenities like parks and sports centers.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. It can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease traffic congestion, promote healthier lifestyles, and lead to economic savings. The passage set provides examples from various cities and regions that have embraced these advantages and implemented measures to limit car usage. As the world continues to prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility, it is crucial for more communities to consider limiting car usage for a better future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have many advantages for individuals and society as a whole. By reducing reliance on cars, we can improve our environment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create healthier, more sustainable communities.

One of the main benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. This is particularly important in today's world where global warming is becoming a major concern.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to cleaner air and less pollution. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution highlights the impact that cars have on air quality. Diesel fuel, which is commonly used in cars, is a major contributor to air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. The passage about Bogota's car-free day demonstrates how people can hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work instead of driving. Encouraging these alternative modes of transportation not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes physical activity and healthier lifestyles. In addition, it can lead to the development of more accessible and efficient public transportation systems, making it easier for people to get around without a car.

Limiting car usage can also have positive social and economic impacts. The passage about Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, highlights how giving up cars can lead to less stress and happier lives for residents. It also mentions how stores are placed within walking distance, creating a more compact and connected community. By reducing car dependency, we can create more livable and vibrant neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative modes of transportation, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. It is essential for us to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a future with reduced reliance on cars.",1
"The Electoral College is not fair and should be abolished. Did you know that 60 percent of voters would prefer a more direct way to vote then what we have now. That is a lot of people who just want a more trustworthy and direct voting process. The Electoral College should be abolished because you can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all.

Having your trust in people who you only see campaigns for on television is pretty hard to do. Honestly that is quite ridiculous for them to ask of us. In source 2, paragraph 11, Plumer tells us about how sometimes ""faithless"" electors disregard their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please. So is it really worth going through the trouble of electing poeple who might not even do as they said they would. Posner on the other hand explains that the trust in the elector is rarely betrayed source 3, paragraph 16. But is it really worth risking four, maybe eight years of our lives to trust poeple we really do not know. Not to mention how it could affect our jobs and lives at home if this does happen.

Did you know seventeen states didn't see any candidates at all in the 2000 campaign. In source 2, paragraph 13, Plumer talks about how candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win. This leaves many states who do not get to see any candidates at all. This makes those states feel like their votes do not count and worry if they their new president willl have any regards for their interest. In source 3, paragraph 19, Posner says that this is a good thing that candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win because then that candidate can focus on the states that may be undecided or swing states. He believes this is a good thing because a candidate with appeal in only a few states is unlikely to be a good president. But you are leaving out a big proportion of the United States population who would love the expiernce of hearing a cadidate give a passionate speech about why heshe should be elected.

We can come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished because you really can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all, which then makes them feel worthless. Furthermore, we can say that the new way to elect the president should be more direct and fair.",0
"Dear Florida Senator, I feel as if we, as Florida citizens should be able to change election by popular votes rather than Electoral College. I understand that The Electoral College is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President and so forth but you don't understand how it is affecting the citizens. We are the people that vote! I am against the Electoral College process because it overrides popular vote, voters aren't really voting for president, and the process is unfair to voters.

To begin, I am against the Electoral College process because it overrides popular vote. For example, in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, he lost the presidency. The popular votes is what really counts because its the actual citizens voting not the electors. In contrast, The Electoral College is a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College process is forgetting that the popular votes is what really matters.

furthermore, I am against the Electoral College because voters aren't really voting for the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. The process isn't even trustworthy because the presidential candidates can elect themselves. Under the electoral college process voters aren't voting for president but for the slate for electors.

Finally, I am against the Electoral College because its unfair to voters. For example, during the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all. candidates don't spend time in states they know they know the have no chance of winning. This is unfair because voters should know who they are voting for. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should not be used because it overrides popular votes and voters aren't really voting for the president. Also because Electoral College is unfair to voters.",0

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, is a compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by Congress. Although many argue for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In an election where disputes can arise, the winner of the Electoral College vote consistently achieves a greater share of electoral votes than their share of popular votes. This reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election where President Obama received a higher proportion of electoral votes compared to his popular vote share.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" As no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are pushed to cultivate trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning states that they are confident of winning, which would leave residents of other regions feeling disenfranchised.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. By using a winner-take-all system, candidates are motivated to concentrate their efforts on toss-up states, where voters pay close attention to the campaign and are more likely to make thoughtful decisions. This ensures that the most informed voters, who have received substantial attention and information from the candidates, have a significant influence in deciding the election's outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides balance between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can lead to an imbalance in political weight, the Electoral College restores some of this balance. For instance, Florida, a large state, received more attention from presidential candidates in the 2012 elections compared to Wyoming, a small state, despite the popular vote being close in both states. This encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens in both populous and less populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of popular votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the necessity and complications of run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and decisive determination of the president.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters by making their vote seemingly irrelevant, studies show that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters participate in the elections to express their political preferences, rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will sway the national outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical institution that preserves the integrity and balance of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader audience, ensures thoughtful voting in swing states, balances the interests of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College to maintain the stability and fairness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the significance of the Electoral College in shaping a successful and representative democracy.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Dear Senator...

The electoral college has recently been a very controversial topic in the world of politics. Many believe that it's a significant system, that's why the Founding Fathers created it, while others argue that it doesn't necessarily work as well. The Electoral College is a process in which there is an agreement between the president's election by a vote in Congress and the president's election by a popular vote made by the citizens. There should be a change in the system into changing election by a popular vote since the Electoral College is not only an outdated system, but it gives the citizens no control over who Congress will be picking.

To start off, the process of the Electoral College should be changed since it's an outdated system. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" it says ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachroism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" Even the article that seems to be favoring the electoral college introduced it as so. It can be seen that it is a process that has been around since America itself, but America has constantly been changing and innovating and it needs a more flexible system to cast the votes. In ""What is the Electoral College""? it states that ""THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS QA COMPROMISE"" HENCE THIS IS STATING THAT THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED A LONG TIME AGO AND IT NEEDS SOME CHANGES.

TO CONTINUE, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED SINCE IT DOESN'T GIVE THE CITIZENS ALOT OF CONTROL AS TO WHO THE CONGRESS WILL BE PICKING. IN ""THE INDEFENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, IT SAYS THAT 'THE SINGLE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE DISASTER FACTOR."" WHAT THIS IS, IS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE NO CONTROL WHOM THE ELECTORS VOTE FOR. AS WELL, IN THE SAME ARTICLE, IT STATES THAT ""AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS UNFAIR TO VOTERS. BECAUSE OF THE WINNER TAKE ALL SYSTEM IN EACH STATE, CANDIDATES DON'T SPEND TIME IN STATES THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NO CHNACE OF WINNING."" WHAT ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT, THE VOTERS HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS PICKING, AND IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER SYSTEM.

TO CONCLUDE, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED TO A NEW SYSETM WHICH IS FAIR AND MORE TRUSTFUL TO THE VOTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE SYSTEM OUTDADE, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE VOTERS ALOT OF CONTROL. A NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. ALTHOUGH MANY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE CHANGED, ALSO SOME BELIEVE IT SHOULD STAY HOW IT IS. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED, SO THIS WAY, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE VOICE, NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT.",0

[Senator's Name]

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my thoughts on the topic of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and popular vote, has both its supporters and critics. After carefully considering the arguments from both sides, I believe it is essential to maintain the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, focus on swing states, allocation of power to big states, and prevention of run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in presidential elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues, a dispute over the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because winning the Electoral College invariably exceeds the candidate's share of the popular vote. This ensures that once the results are determined, there is no ambiguity or prolonged legal battles that could undermine the credibility of the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation rather than just one or a few regions. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal to garner support from diverse regions. This results in a president who understands the concerns and needs of the entire country, preventing any particular region from feeling disenfranchised.

In addition, the Electoral College system focuses campaign efforts on swing states, increasing voter engagement and informed decision-making. As Judge Posner points out, candidates concentrate their efforts on these states as they hold the key to deciding the election outcome. This encourages voters in swing states to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to thoughtful and informed decision-making. It ensures that the most crucial voters have a significant say in determining the president.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states, preventing small states from being overshadowed. As Bradford Plumer states, the popular vote alone does not adequately account for the weight of large states. With the Electoral College, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns due to their higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates address the concerns and priorities of both small and large states, fostering a sense of inclusiveness and fairness in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast. Instead of creating a complex and potentially lengthy run-off process, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This allows for a smooth and efficient transition of power, minimizing disruptions and ensuring a strong and stable leadership for the nation.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states they deem unwinnable, studies show that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation of swinging the national outcome. Therefore, this argument against the Electoral College holds little weight.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served as a crucial institution to ensure the fair and effective election of the President of the United States. Its ability to provide certainty of outcome, represent all regions, focus campaigns on swing states, allocate power to big states, and prevent run-off elections demonstrates the strength and validity of the system. As a concerned citizen, I strongly urge you to support the preservation of the Electoral College to maintain the integrity and balance of the presidential election process.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make choices that best serve the interests of our nation and its citizens.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator the electoral voting system should be abolished it is unofair and undemocratic electoral votes are not the votes of the people and thats all that should matter but there are countercaims that I will address. when person votes they do not actually vote ofor their candidate they vote ofor a group oof electors ofor that candidate electors who may not even vote ofor the candidate they are sworn to. the electoral voting system is extremely unstable there are an even number oof electoral voters in the united states making a tied vote a possibility which is very bad. Even though electoral votes are supposedly based on which candidates people vote ofor it does not at all mean that the candidate who most oof the people voted ofor wil also be voted ofor by the electoral college.

The electoral voters are separated by state and each state has its own number oof electoral voters proportional to their population. because oof this candidates change their campaigns to only ofocus on stateswith more electoral voters while this makes sense ofrom a competitive perspective it makes it extremely unofair to states with smaller populations. This is wrong in many ways but the worst oof all is that the electoral voting system encourages this kind oof competition The electoral voting system is undemocratic the united states prides itselof on being ofor the people and ofreedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite oof that. the electoral college votes not the people. the people are not voting and that is the exact opposite oof what the united states supossedly stands ofor. Anyone who learns about the united states and sees the electoral college will think that the united states. is not all its cracked up to be and that is not what the united states wants is it?

in conclusion the senator you should deofinetly try to work toward abolishing the electoral college as it is undemocratic because it does not allow the people to have a direct say in who they are voting ofor. it is a very volatile voting system that could cause crashes and severities in the united states by aving tied votes and such. the electoral voting system encourages some states to be leoft out by unofair competition because oof the unstable way the number oof electoral voters are balanced between states. And the electoral college essentially goes against everything the united states stands ofor and is supposed to believe in.",0
"Dear Rick Scott, Every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, the Electoral College casts their votes to elect the new President of the United States of America. These voters are chosen by the citizens of their state Florida, Texas, etc. to vote in their favor of their preferred party. For example, a Democratic voter in California will vote for Democratic Electoral College candidates to vote for their preferred President. Though many people are opposed to this method of voting, calling it an anachronism & taking away the vote from the citizens of the United States, American citizen's votes still count, the Electoral College can avoid problems popular voting could result in, and the Electoral College listens to those with the initiative and right to make a smart vote. For these reasons I would like to keep the Electoral College.

The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise between election of the President by a vote of Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, meaning one vote almost relies on the other. A common misconception made by citizens is that when they vote they vote for a President, when in fact they are voting for people to vote in their favor for the President. So the more Republican Electoral College voters your state has, most likely the end vote will be the electoral votes go to the Republican candidate. Many people say that the electoral college ""takes away the votes of the citizens, and that their vote doesn't matter"" when in reality, they matter in every way possible. If the citizens do not vote, who will vote for the electoral college members? And without the citizens to decide who the members of the Electoral College will be, who will be in the Electoral College all together?

Not only do the Citizen's votes count, but the Electoral College can help solve the problems that a popular voting system could have. The Electoral College votes with the majority of the state, meaning that the party with the highest request for its Presidency, the Electoral College will cast its votes towards. Meaning a highly Democratic state can count on their state's vote to most likely be for the Democratic candidate. The Electoral College also avoids runoff elections. This means that the election will always show a clear winner for the state's vote. There is a lot of potential pressure for a runoff election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cats that pressure could greatly affect the Presidential election process, which the Electoral College reduces, ultimately showing a clear winner.

And finally, the Electoral College listens to smart and eligible voters. Very rarely does a State's Electoral College vote against the wishes of their citizens. In fact that would be the exact opposite of their job. It's also an inetible fact that not every voter is an ideal voter. Many citizens do not keep themselves up to date on the issues candidates plan to solve, occupation backgrounds, or even their personality. Many voters in fact vote on astetics, which is ultimately the most dangerous voter there is an uner educated one.

So Mr. Scott, I hope you take into account that an in terms of an electoral college, an American citizen's vote does count, they avoid the problems popular votes could create, and they do listen to their state's smart, eligable voters. If the Founding Fathers created this tool for the balance in our voting system, then balance there shall be.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

There are numerous advantages to limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages provided. One advantage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where automobile dependency is high, we can significantly reduce these emissions.

Another advantage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. The passages mention examples of car-free communities, like Vauban in Germany and car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. In these communities, residents have the option to walk or cycle to their destinations, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality. Additionally, public transportation becomes more accessible and efficient when there are fewer cars on the road.

Limiting car usage also leads to the creation of more compact and walkable communities. The passages mention how stores in car-free communities are placed a walk away on a main street, rather than in distant malls accessible only by car. This approach allows for a more vibrant and connected community, where residents can easily access amenities and interact with one another.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on people's well-being and quality of life. In Vauban, Germany, residents reported feeling less stressed and happier after giving up their cars. This can be attributed to the reduction in traffic noise, improved air quality, and the increased opportunity for physical activity from walking or cycling.

Lastly, reducing car usage can lead to cost savings for individuals and governments. The passages mention how residents of Vauban sold their cars to move to a car-free community, indicating that owning and maintaining a car can be a financial burden. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, governments can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking spaces.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of alternative modes of transportation, the creation of more compact and walkable communities, improved well-being, and cost savings. These advantages are key in addressing climate change, promoting sustainable development, and enhancing the quality of life for individuals and communities. It is important for individuals, governments, and communities to embrace these advantages and work towards reducing car dependency.",1
"The Electoral College should be kept for the voting of the President. There are many reasons to support this conclusion. When the people vote for a President, they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This can be a good and bad thing. The good thing is that the Electoral College keeps balance. The bad part is that some Americans see that is unfair that they cannot vote for a President directly.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance between small and large states as it says in paragraph 21. This means that it makes sure the election is fair, not one person can be voted president just because they campaigned in a larger state more people. The Electoral College also balances out the winners. They are the people who pick the clear winner when two candidates get tied. This happened to Nixon and Clinton. They both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes as it says in paragraph 22. In these kind of situations it is good to have a backup plan also known as the Electoral College.

Although the Electoral College is a helpful and fair way to vote, some Americans do not see it that way. In fact,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now as it says in paragraph 9. There reasoning is that they cannot vote directly. They vote for a slate of electors who then vote for the president. They see this as unfair and think that they should be able to vote for the president directly. Below the 14th paragraph, it says ""lost the presidency: In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide,but Bush won the election,receiving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266."" Although this may seem unfair, the reality of it is that the Electoral College is just trying to keep the election for President fair. The Electoral College help to ensure that all of the candidates for President have a fair advantage. If the Electoral College wasnt there to balance out the voting, then the candidates could cheat. By cheat, this means that they could campaign in a bigger place of they could be from a different place than another president and have a unfair advantage because of the bigger population. If one president was from Texas and the other was from Florida, the candidate from Texas would have a unfair advantage because hes from a place with a bigger population. Why this is unfair is because if a candidate is from a area with a big population, the people in that area are most likely going to vote more towards that candidates side. In the last sentence of paragraph 21, it says ""Alarge state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states."" In the end, there are always going to be downfalls. The Electoral College may pick the opposite candidate that the majority of the people want, this is true. Also, the people may feel that it is wrong to not go with the peoples opinion. If the Electoral College was not there to decide, there would be all forms of chaos. As it says 1822, the candidates would have an unfair advantage. The situations on both ends have cons but the Electoral College staying solves more problems than creating them.",0

Subject: The Importance of Maintaining the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College, as I firmly believe that it is a crucial and valuable system that should be upheld in the election process for the President of the United States. While there may be arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I contend that the Electoral College offers several significant benefits that outweigh its drawbacks.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, making it highly unlikely to result in a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This guarantees a more stable and predictable outcome, avoiding prolonged legal battles that would only undermine the integrity of our democracy.

Moreover, the Electoral College promotes the principles of representative democracy. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the system ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign across the nation rather than focusing solely on the densely populated areas. Consequently, all regions and their respective interests receive attention and consideration, preventing any sense of disenfranchisement among voters. Judge Posner rightly argues that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Therefore, the Electoral College safeguards against the potential exclusion of certain regions in the decision-making process.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes benefits swing states and encourages more thoughtful participation from voters. Swing states attract the most campaign efforts due to the importance of their electoral votes, prompting candidates to engage more deeply with their citizens. This heightened attention results in greater access to information, more extensive debates, and ultimately, more informed voters. The Electoral College incentivizes candidates to listen to the concerns of the swing states, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the power to decide the election outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which grants each state an equal number of seats, often disadvantages larger states in other aspects of governance. However, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance by giving larger states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. It provides a fair representation of diverse interests across states, fosters inclusivity, and prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College ensures a clear winner. This avoids complications and delays in the election process, allowing for a smooth and efficient transition of power.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voting in ""safe"" states, the fact remains that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation of wielding decisive power. Thus, the possibility of not carrying one's state should not discourage voter engagement, as evidenced by the significant turnout in past elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential component of our democratic system that serves to protect and uphold the principles of representative democracy. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, prevents regional exclusion, encourages thoughtful voter participation, balances power between states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some may argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College remains a vital safeguard that ensures fairness and stability in our electoral process. I urge you to consider these points and continue supporting the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Limiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.

When consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.

Limiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too. Limiting car use is good for the city.",1
"Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportation are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner.

It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to fortythousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of vaughn's families do not even own cars, and fiftyseven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. vaughn's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in, Paris bans driving due to smog.

Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths.

In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, rollerskates, skateboards longboards, and penny boards, or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage.

Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in, The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twentythree percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people.

In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.",0
"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives.

Limiting car usage in your community is good because it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of nearrecord pollution due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with evennumbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set.

Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garage in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution.

We should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries believe so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined 25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.

There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic , helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often , take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities.",0
"The Election System should be changed to popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair and irrational. It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since. Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high. The Electoral College Isn't an amount of how many people voted for a president, its for an elector. And you dont always pick your elector, it could get confused and a wrong elector could get picked.

Many states do not have a fair chance to vote, And one representative can count as too many votes compared to their own value. Sates that didnt have the chance to see the candidates were most likely ignored with docent help because even if the people guessed a vote the electors would give out a large number of votes randomly to a candidate. Some staes didnt even get so see an ad for the candidates once.

""A single representative from wyoming representing five hundred thousand representatives would have as much to say as fifty five representatives from California, who represent thirty five million voters."" "" During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt get to see the candidates at all,Including rhode island and south carolinia, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad."" These qoutes from bradford plumber, explain that half of the peoples votes were going to wrong candidates as the pepole were completley confused about who they were even voting for. They didnt even get Ads that could give them at least a look or a hint, basically, the people were clueless. It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College docent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a candidate.

In addition, The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for candidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive effects of reducing car dependency in suburban areas. In Germany, the suburb of Vauban has implemented a car-free policy, where residents are not allowed to have vehicles except for two designated parking lots on the outskirts of the community. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents sold their cars to move there. This has created a peaceful and less stressful environment, with verdant streets filled with bicycles and children instead of the noise and pollution of cars. Vauban is part of a larger movement called ""smart planning,"" which aims to separate suburban life from auto use. This approach is being adopted worldwide in an effort to make suburbs more compact, accessible to public transportation, and with reduced parking space.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced due to severe smog caused by car emissions. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or face fines. This ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion in the city and highlighted the negative impact of car usage on air quality. Diesel fuel was specifically blamed for the smog, as France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. The ban in Paris demonstrates the need to promote alternative transportation and reduce reliance on cars, especially in heavily polluted areas.

Bogota, Colombia, has implemented an annual car-free day to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participate by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, leaving the streets empty of traffic. The success of this event has led other cities in Colombia and even neighboring countries to adopt similar initiatives. Bogota has also made significant improvements in its infrastructure, including the construction of extensive bicycle paths and the development of parks and sports centers, all aimed at reducing traffic congestion and creating a more sustainable city.

Evidence suggests that car usage in the United States may be on the decline. Recent studies indicate that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The number of miles driven in the United States has dropped since 2005, even before the recession, and this decrease seems to be persisting even as the economy recovers. This could have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. However, it could also have negative implications for the car industry. The rise of technologies such as the Internet, telecommuting, and cellphone apps has made it easier for people to connect without needing to drive. Cities are also prioritizing alternative modes of transportation, such as bike-sharing programs and car-sharing programs. Demographic shifts also indicate a decrease in car ownership among young people, while older generations are likely to retain their licenses as they age.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. Examples from around the world demonstrate the positive effects of reducing car dependency in suburban areas, improving air quality in polluted cities, and promoting alternative transportation options. The decline in car usage in the United States also has potential benefits for carbon emissions and the environment. By adopting smart planning principles, promoting alternative transportation, and investing in sustainable infrastructure, countries and cities can create a more livable and environmentally friendly future.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

The idea of limiting car usage has gained traction in recent years as a way to combat greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on automobiles. This trend can be seen in places like Vauban, Germany, where residents have given up their cars and embraced a car-free lifestyle. This shift towards limiting car usage has several advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating more accessible communities, and improving public health.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more accessible communities. In Vauban, for example, the streets are completely car-free, except for a few designated areas. As a result, 70 percent of the families in Vauban do not own cars and have found alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or using public transportation. This leads to more walkable neighborhoods, with stores placed within walking distance and a reduced need for sprawling parking lots. Creating more accessible communities promotes physical activity and reduces traffic congestion.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on public health. Cars contribute to air pollution, and the smog in cities like Paris and Bogota has led to driving bans in an effort to clear the air. By reducing the number of cars on the road, communities can improve air quality and reduce the incidence of respiratory diseases. Additionally, limiting car usage encourages people to engage in physical activity by walking or biking, which has numerous health benefits, including improving cardiovascular fitness and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. This trend can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more accessible communities, and improve public health. By transitioning towards alternative modes of transportation and adopting smarter planning strategies, communities can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future. It is important for both individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and take action to implement changes in their communities.",1
"  Paving the Way to Sustainable Urban Life  In a world marked by relentless urbanization and escalating environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift in urban planning, where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, making room for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary perspective on urban living, focusing on sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, yet this transition is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the central benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, contributing to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Moreover, car-free cities make efficient use of urban space, converting parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Reduced reliance on private cars results in decreased traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and reduced stress levels for urban inhabitants. Additionally, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by relying less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. The process of reconfiguring urban areas for car-free living is complex and time-consuming, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1
"In our society today, limiting car usage would be the best way to go. There are plenty of advantages to limiting car usage, with a decrease in pollution just to name one of them. If we can capitalize on the downward shift of automobile users in the United States and around the world, then it would benefit all of us in more ways then one.

Having a car can be handy to get from point A to point B, but what if you just do not need to use that car at all? What if you are just to lazy to walk or bike to your destination? I am not saying you should walk 80 miles to your aunt's house, but what if it was just to the store that was a half of a mile away. Not to mention that you would be saving good on gas money. There is a mostly car free suburb, for example, in Germany that focuses on a majority of the population of the neighborhood to not use cars. This town is named Vauban, and 70 percent of families do not own a car here. It may sound bad to those who live and die by their car, but with everything in walking distance it makes it easy and accessible to walk from point A to point B most of the time. The residents of this suburb are positive about this change, and they should be, because it is a positive change.

One very large problem with the excessive use of cars in one area is air pollution. Lots of cars in the same area commuting can create a thick layer of smoke in the air called smog, and it is not pleasant to experience on the road. That being said, Paris had recently gotten so much smog in the air that it had to put down a partial ban, license plates with even numbers could not drive on Monday, while odd numbered plates could not drive on Tuesday. It sounds crazy, how could such a busy city like Paris realistically put down a travel ban on half of the commuters? Whether you thought it would or not, it worked. Sure there were a couple of motorists who could not take no for an answer and still commuted when they were not suppose to, but a large majority followed the rules of this ban. Apparently the French government underestimated the factor these cars had on the environment, as the ban was recinded early on Tuesday for the pollution almost completely cleared away.

In support of those two points, the amount of drivers every year has been going down since its peak point in 2005. The gap is nearly nine percent, almost a tenth of the United States has stopped driving in the last 10 years. With this pattern taking place, scientists believe that it will only have postive benefits for the environment and the communities in the forseeable future. The United States is one of the most polluted countries in the world, which in large part is because of our advanced and highly populated culture. That doesnt mean we cant make a difference and help our community grow into a better place environmentally. One good example of that happening is the car free day in Bogota. In this city millions of people got around without using cars and have been since 1995 in this program. It has led to the blooming of brand new parks and repaved, smoother sidewalks. If millions of Colombians can make their community a better place in a heavily populated area, so should we.

To summarize, plenty of places around the world are making good efforts to tone down on car usage. This helps bring down levels of air pollution, enhance the community that those people live in and help their financial situations by saving money on buying a car. If we in America can make these kind of efforts to decrease car usage, our whole country would be better for it in more ways than one.",0
"If you were told on some days of the week that you are not allowed to drive your car to work, or even use your car at all, would you be glad or happy? Many people don't like it at first, but then grow to like the changes and outcome of not using your car as much, or not having a car. Some people say they are less stressed by not driving, or owning a car. Also people are happier that they are saving money. And they are helping the environment because it is not so polluted and smogged.

First off, when you have a car and drive it around all day, and sit in it all day, its stressful. When you are rushing yourself out the door in the morning so you're not late to work, and then you have to sit in traffic for 30 minutes or so just to get to work, is very stressful. Then on your way home from work is very stressful too. You are coming home in what is called ""rush hour"" where everyone is getting off work around the same time 5am and you just have to sit in more traffic every day! It is less stressful to not have a car, or use your car that much because you can then walk, or ride a bike. So its more relaxing and you get more time outside and excersizing. Also when you are not using your car, or do not own a car, you become more responsible and have a better track of time. So that just helps out with not being as stressed out!

Another reason why people like not driving or owning a car is that people are saving money. If you are not driving as much, then you dont need to go out and pay for gas as often. If you don't own a car at all, then you don't have to pay those monthly bills of owning that car, plus you don't have to pay for gas at all! Also by not driving as much or not owning a car does not tempt you to go out and spend the day at the mall, or always go out for lunch and dinner with friends. In todays society, many people want to save money. Many people try to save money, but don't know where to start or how to start. And with this way, just may be a helping hint to it.

With not driving as much, actually helps our planet and environment. It may not seem like it, but it does. Your not polluting the environment, and youre just being one more person to help make it a healthier environment and planet. If we had atleast 50 maybe 100 people from each city across America to not use their car 3 days a week, can make a big major difference in todays society in the multiple ways. It would help out in ways like not being as stressed, saving money, and helping our environment too.

There is many reasons as to why not driving as much or not owning a car can help out yourself, and the environment. Just by not driving as much or owning a car can make you a better person by not being as stressed out, you save lots of money by not driving so often or owning a car, and you are also helping our environment and planet by becoming a better and healthier place.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the current Electoral College system in place for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College provides several essential benefits that should be considered before any changes are made.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College method produces a clear winner, which reduces the likelihood of disputes over the result. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only received 51.3% of the popular vote. This demonstrates how the Electoral College allows for a decisive victory and helps avoid ongoing disputes that could arise in a popular vote system.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" Judge Posner highlights that the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents a candidate with only regional support from winning. This is crucial because it ensures that the president represents the interests of all regions and avoids making certain regions feel disenfranchised. By appealing to voters across various regions, candidates are incentivized to address diverse interests and concerns, leading to a more balanced and representative presidency.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. In the article by Judge Posner, he explains how the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. By giving swing states a significant role in deciding the election, the Electoral College ensures that campaigns are not focused solely on densely populated areas while neglecting the concerns of smaller, less populous states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance to the political system by giving weight to large states. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate outlined in the Constitution already disadvantages larger states. By awarding electoral votes based on state population, the Electoral College offsets some of this political imbalance. This way, candidates are forced to pay attention to the larger states in their campaign strategies, ensuring that the interests of all states, regardless of size, are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. Without the Electoral College, there is a higher possibility of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Avoiding run-off elections simplifies the presidential election process and ensures a clear winner is determined without further complications.

Although some criticize the Electoral College for potentially disenfranchising voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout remains strong despite this. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, about half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election, even though they knew their single vote would not sway the final outcome. This demonstrates that voters participate in elections to express their political preferences rather than solely to influence the result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, equitable representation, and a balanced campaign focus, while also preventing run-off elections. These factors make a compelling case for maintaining the current system for electing the President of the United States. I urge you to consider the benefits of the Electoral College and support its continuation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will make the decision that best serves the interests of our great nation and its citizens.

Subject: In Defense of the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College provides essential benefits to our democracy that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As outlined by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. This prevents disputes over the election outcome and ensures a clear and decisive victor. While there have been instances of electoral disputes, they are far less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 presidential election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the representation of all regions and prevents a candidate from having purely regional appeal. Each region of our country has a significant number of electoral votes, and no single region has enough to elect a president. This encourages candidates to campaign and address the concerns of voters across different regions, preventing them from focusing solely on populous areas or regions where they have overwhelming support. In turn, this creates a president who genuinely represents the interests of all Americans, regardless of their regional location.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads to effective campaign strategies and fosters meaningful engagement with voters. As Judge Posner points out, the focus on swing states ensures that candidates invest time and effort in convincing voters in those states. This compels voters in swing states to pay close attention to the candidates' policies and proposals, ultimately resulting in a more educated and thoughtful electorate. By concentrating campaign efforts on these states, candidates address the concerns of a diverse range of voters and create policies that align with their needs and aspirations.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power held by large states. Due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, smaller states are given equal weighting when it comes to electing the president. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated regions and ensures that the concerns and interests of citizens in smaller states are given due consideration. It creates a more equitable representation of all Americans and prevents a small number of densely populated states from overwhelming the voice of citizens in less populous areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College system avoids the complications that could arise from run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes, the Electoral College always produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections, allowing for a smooth and efficient election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College system may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to note that voter turnout is not solely driven by the belief that a single vote may decide an election. In the 2012 election, approximately half of eligible Americans cast their votes, indicating a desire to express their political preference regardless of the outcome. Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that all states receive attention during the campaign, as candidates understand the impact of winning electoral votes from various regions.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a vital role in our democracy, guaranteeing a certain outcome, ensuring representation from all regions, promoting focused campaigning, balancing political power among states, and avoiding the need for run-off elections. The Electoral College is not a perfect system, but it offers crucial benefits that should not be disregarded. I urge you to consider these advantages when evaluating any proposals to change the current method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my viewpoint on the matter of the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After careful consideration of various arguments, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained as the method for selecting the President.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the election process. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. With a majority of electoral votes being required to elect the President, there is a higher level of certainty in determining the winner (Posner 18).

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of collective ownership and representation for all citizens across the nation. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from becoming president, promoting a more inclusive leadership that considers the interests of all regions (Posner 19).

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to emphasize the importance of swing states. As noted by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to more thoughtful and informed decisions. Toss-up states become the deciding factor in the election, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the power to shape the outcome (Posner 20).

Additionally, the Electoral College grants due importance to large states. Judge Posner explains how the Electoral College balances the weight of large states losing representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as their victories yield a higher number of electoral votes. This maintains a political balance that acknowledges the diverse needs and interests of both small and large states (Posner 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the popular votes, this could lead to further complications in the election process. With the Electoral College, the clear winner is determined based on the majority of electoral votes received, ensuring a decisive outcome (Posner 22).

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in ""non-competitive"" states, the fact remains that people vote to express their political preference rather than in the belief that their vote alone will decide the election (Posner 23). The Electoral College system upholds the fundamentals of our democratic process while maintaining a fair and effective means to elect the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved as the method of electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure certainty, foster unity and representation, highlight swing states, provide importance to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all valuable advantages that contribute to the effectiveness of our democratic system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will carefully consider the benefits of maintaining the Electoral College in future discussions on this issue.

Sincerely,

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Car usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many parts of the world. However, the increasing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and the negative impacts of car culture on the environment have led to a growing movement to limit car usage. This essay will explore the advantages of restricting car usage based on the information provided in the passages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to promoting alternative transportation methods and improving public health, limiting car usage can create a more sustainable and livable future for all.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passage 5 supports this idea by stating that passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of emissions both in Europe and the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, where cars are the primary mode of transportation, we can see a significant decrease in carbon emissions. Passage 29 suggests that recent studies in the United States show a decline in car usage, indicating a cultural shift that can positively impact the environment.

Body Paragraph 2:
Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods. Passage 22 describes how Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day to encourage the use of buses, bikes, and walking. The participation and enthusiasm of the residents demonstrate that people are willing to embrace alternative means of transportation when given the opportunity. By limiting car usage, we create an environment that is more conducive to public transportation, cycling, and walking. This shift can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create more connected communities.

Body Paragraph 3:
Limiting car usage can also have significant benefits for public health. Passage 11 highlights the driving ban enforced in Paris due to smog pollution. The resulting decrease of congestion reduced pollution levels and improved air quality. Passage 13 suggests that congestion in Paris was reduced by 60 percent during the ban. Similar initiatives in cities like Bogota, as mentioned in Passage 26, have also shown positive results in reducing traffic congestion. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative transportation methods, we can minimize air pollution, which has a direct impact on respiratory health and overall well-being.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative transportation methods, and improving public health. The information presented in the passages supports the idea that a cultural shift towards less car-dependent lifestyles is occurring. By adopting smart planning techniques, creating car-reduced communities, and improving public transportation infrastructure, we can create a more sustainable future. It is important for citizens to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and support initiatives that promote alternative transportation methods. Together, we can work towards a greener, healthier, and more connected society.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and the method of electing the President of the United States. As an engaged citizen who cares deeply about the democratic process, I believe it is essential to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College system and the popular vote system, and make an informed decision regarding the best course of action for our nation's future.

One of the most significant arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Despite the occasional dispute, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is invariably greater than their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear and decisive outcome. The winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electoral votes contributes to this certainty. In contrast, a direct popular vote system can lead to disputes over the accuracy of the count, as witnessed in the closely contested 2000 presidential election. By preserving the Electoral College, we keep the process more manageable and less prone to confusion and contention.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the President is not only supported by a single region but possesses trans-regional appeal. A candidate must garner support from multiple regions of the country to secure the needed electoral votes. This encourages candidates to develop policies that address the interests and concerns of diverse populations throughout the nation. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could potentially empower candidates with only regional appeal, disenfranchising voters from other regions who may feel their interests are not adequately represented.

The Electoral College also places an emphasis on swing states and fosters a rigorous campaign process. Candidates concentrate their efforts on these states, considering the significance of winning their electoral votes. This, in turn, encourages voters in swing states to pay closer attention to the campaign, as they understand the pivotal role they play in deciding the outcome of the election. By maintaining the Electoral College, we uphold the value of an engaged electorate and ensure that decisions are made by those who have considered the competing candidates and their policies carefully.

Another aspect to consider is that the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, which benefits small states, is counterbalanced by the Electoral College system. The electoral votes awarded to each state are determined based on their representation in Congress, providing a proportional influence regardless of population size. This ensures that candidates cannot focus exclusively on large states and neglect the concerns of smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections by ensuring that a clear majority winner emerges. This is especially important when there are multiple candidates with significant support but no candidate manages to garner a majority of the popular vote. By designating one candidate as the winner through the electoral vote count, we avoid the logistical challenges and potential uncertainty associated with run-off elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College disenfranchises voters in states they know will vote overwhelmingly for a particular candidate, it is important to note that the same can occur in any voting system. Voters should be encouraged to participate, knowing that their vote contributes to the overall political direction of the nation, regardless of the outcome in their state.

In light of these reasons, I firmly believe that the Electoral College serves as a crucial mechanism in our democracy. It protects against potential election crises and ensures that candidates have broad appeal, encourages engagement from voters in swing states, provides proportional representation for large and small states, and avoids the complexity of run-off elections. It is a system designed to uphold the principles of our democratic republic.

I urge you to carefully consider these points when advocating for the preservation of the Electoral College or considering a transition to a popular vote system. The complexity of our nation's diverse population and the need for proportional representation should not be overlooked.

Thank you for your commitment to serving our state and country. I trust that you will weigh these arguments thoughtfully and make a decision that aligns with the best interests of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"Cars are like beneficial disadvantages they allow you to arrive at your destination in a short amount of time, but they add to the world's pollution growing issue. Individuals in every single part of the world own cars and millions of cars are on our streets and highways daily. Whether it is to comute to work or visit a friend in the next town over, individuals are constantly on the road. While cars do simplify our lives today, in the near future cars will become a burden, due to the amount of pollution they produce and the stress they cause upon individuals. Limiting car usage in all parts of the world will bring more joy and persistent smiles.

Cars play a dramatic role in the amount of pollution that is in our air today. Which is also essential for our survival. Limiting car usage will decrease the amount of pollution we have today and the disgusting greenhouse gas emissions. ""Up to 50 percent"" of green house gas emissions alone are caused by carintense areas in the United States acknowledged by Elisabeth Rosenthal, in the article "" In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars "". Furthermore, in the capital of France due to ""intensifying smog 60 percent"" of the individuals were in a severe traffic jam explained by Robert Duffer, in "" "". The smog was caused by cold nights and warm days and the warmer layer of air imprisoning car emissions and pollution pollution being caused by over usage of cars, meaning car usage should be limited if not halted all at once.

Individuals participating in events like Carfree day and living in towns like Vauban tend to be a lot more joyful and enthusiastic. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by an individual named Heidrun Walter, who moved to Vauban for a more jubilating experience. Cars add stress due to having to be stuck in agonising traffic and having to pay for ridiculous gas prices. Also, by limiting car usage you'll witness and hear more individuals enjoying themselves walking the street, and ""the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor."" described by Robert Duffer, in "" In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars "". Evenmore so, by abandoning your vehicle at home you won't have to deal with enebidable traffic and ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" brought up by Andrew Selsky, in source 3 "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "". Carless stress less.

Before saying cars are benefitial think of all the disadvanteges that they hold. All the disadvanteges out weigh the advantages. Pollution no matter how big or small is a humungous issue that can be prevented little by little by limiting car usage. Also, limited smiles will become persistent smiles if you limit car usage across the nation. More smiles and less cars is the way to go.",0
"Reducing the amount of cars used would benefit the fellow citizens greatly. Limiting car usage would decrease the amount of pollution in the air greatly, because they are among the main causes of emissions into the air among many countries. A better environment for the citizens would arise because the infrastructure of many cities would improve and the people would exercise more, therefore becoming healthier. Also, congestion would dramatically decrease because less people would be on the road which also leads to less car accidents so less people would be getting injured from a car accident.

Car emissions all over the world are among the main causes for the air pollution and greenhouse gasses. In cities llike Paris the air pollution rose so much that there was a temporal driving ban on the whole city. This ban eventually cleared the air but if this could happen in one city it is more than likely to happen again in another city. These car emissions are clearly a large part of this air pollution as Elisabeth Rosenthal shows the U.S has a fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the abundant amount of cars. Limiting the car usage would clearly diminish the amount of emissions in the air and prevent these large amounts of smog and pollution to form in the air that the people are breathing.

In the city Bogota a carfree day was hosted to promote public transportation, and it had created many benefits to the city's infrastructure. With more money coming in from these public transportation the government has more money to fix and improve upon the city's infrastructure. The sidewalks were fixed, more restaurants were opened, and more people attended parks, and sports centers. If more cities implemented this carfree program for longer than a day the people would be becoming healthier and the environment would be a lot safer with better sidewalks, and better infrastructure in general. Also with these new buildings being created more jobs would naturally also be created therefore unemployment would also be decreasing in the cities that are restricting cars. In Vauban, a city almost no cars, the citizens live happy with a rectangular shape to their city to maintain everything close and a small walk away from almost everything, therefore the infrastructure for the city is clearly well built and no cars are needed.

The restriction of cars would also make the roads a lot safer considering there are less cars to crash into or cause accidents. As shown from the Paris ban on cars, congestion had decreased sixty percent from what it was originally. The only people driving would be the conductors of the public transportation vehicles, therefore a majority of the drivers on the streets would be experienced and not be drunk while driving. The decrease in congestion would also lead to a much more efficient mode on transportation from the busses, and they would travel much faster to their destinations.

With the restriction of car usage the positive benefits created would immensely improve the living conditions and environment that the citizens live in. With a cleaner environment free of pollution the people would live healthier, infrastructure would improve greatly allowing more jobs to be created as well, and less congestion and car accidents would occur in the cities. The restriction of car ussage would improve the citizen's lives greatly.",0

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider its benefits when contemplating any potential changes to the current system of electing the President of the United States.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote by qualified citizens. Its process involves the selection of electors, the voting by electors for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to elect the President (What Is the Electoral College?).

While critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and undemocratic, there are several practical reasons why it should be retained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome is higher with the Electoral College. Although disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. Due to the winner-take-all system in each state, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote (Posner, 18).

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President has a trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning candidates must appeal to a diverse range of states and regions. This results in a President who represents the interests and concerns of the entire nation, rather than just a specific region (Posner, 19).

Moreover, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This allows voters in these states to have a more direct impact on the election and encourages candidates to address the specific concerns of these states (Posner, 20).

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the weight of large states against small states. Although the popular vote may be close in a large state, the winner receives a significant number of electoral votes, ensuring their attention and consideration for the concerns of that state. This prevents smaller states from being overlooked in the electoral process (Posner, 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This reduces the complexity and cost of the election process while still producing a clear and decisive winner (Posner, 22).

It is important to note that voter turnout is not significantly affected by the Electoral College. Despite the fact that individual votes may not swing a national election, approximately half of the eligible American population still participates in presidential elections (Posner, 23). Voters are driven by their desire to express their political preference rather than solely relying on the belief that their vote will decide the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a practical and effective method for electing the President. Its retention ensures certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the weight of large and small states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to any system, it is crucial to consider the experience and wisdom of our founding fathers when evaluating any potential changes to the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of retaining the Electoral College for the future of our democratic nation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"The time of the founding fathers is long gone. Times have changed which means we have to change our way of thinking. Our way of voting. The Electoral college needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their preferred president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people.

Initially, by keeping the Electoral College individuals are less incentivized to vote if they know there is little chance it will do anything. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" Source 3, 23. However, by implementing popular vote, many more people will want to vote knowing that even if their side does not get the majority vote in the state, it still counts for something. Also, from that same source it says ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense."" Source 2, 15. So one would have to ask if the source is even reliable if it contradicts itself. In addition, even if they usually vote ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" source 2, 13. This shows that states with more electoral votes will have more power over the people. Clearly, the Electoral College is a problem and popular vote is a much better way to vote.

Furthermore, because some states old more power than others wen it comes to elections, presidents often ignore the ""smaller"" states looking only for votes. For example, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Source 2, 13. Candidates are not interested in the states, in the people, who do not give them enough votes. This is why the Electoral needs to be abolished and replaced with popular vote elections.

Moreover, just because a president wins the campaign, does not mean that the candidate won the people's votes, it only means that he won the Electoral College's votes. For example, in the 2000 election and the 1888 election, one party won even though majority of the votes went to the other. In the 2000 election, even though Gore had more popular votes than Bush, he still lost because he had fewer electoral votes. This shows that there is something broken in the system. Something that can't be changed and needs to be replaced. As you can see, popular votes are the way to go in such an important election like the presidential one with so much on the line.

In conclusion, the Electoral college needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their preferred president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people. The Electoral College might have been good in the past however, now it just complicated the process and is unfair.",0
"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This idea is exemplified in the German suburb, Vauban, where residents have given up their cars in favor of alternative means of transportation. This movement towards ""smart planning"" is gaining traction in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world. By limiting car usage, communities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate congestion, and promote healthier, more connected neighborhoods.

One of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with Europe attributing 12% and some areas in the United States attributing up to 50%. By moving away from a car-centric lifestyle, communities can drastically reduce their impact on the environment. The German suburb of Vauban, for example, has seen a significant decrease in car ownership, with 70% of families not owning a car at all. This shift towards alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, can help combat climate change and improve air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in congestion. Car-dependent suburbs often suffer from traffic jams and overcrowded roads, leading to increased commute times and frustration for residents. By adopting a more compact and accessible approach to suburban planning, communities can create infrastructure that prioritizes walking, biking, and public transportation. This not only reduces congestion but also makes neighborhoods more livable and people-friendly. Vauban, for instance, has placed stores within walking distance of residential areas, encouraging a sense of community and making daily errands more convenient.

In addition to reducing emissions and congestion, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on health and well-being. Increased reliance on walking and biking promotes physical activity, leading to a healthier population. The absence of cars in Vauban has created a peaceful and calm environment, where the sounds of bicycles and conversation replace the noise of traffic. Residents often cite increased happiness and reduced stress as major benefits of living car-free.

While the transition to limiting car usage may present challenges, such as a loss of revenue for delivery companies, the long-term benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Government initiatives, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's promotion of ""car reduced"" communities in the United States, are supporting this movement. As more communities adopt alternative transportation methods and create infrastructure that facilitates car-free living, the demand for cars may decrease, resulting in a cultural shift away from car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating congestion, and promoting healthier neighborhoods, communities can create more sustainable and livable environments. The German suburb of Vauban exemplifies this movement towards ""smart planning,"" where the majority of families do not own cars, and daily life revolves around walking, biking, and public transportation. As more communities around the world adopt similar approaches, the benefits of limiting car usage will become increasingly apparent.",1
"  A Vision of Sustainable Urban Living  In an era characterized by rapid urbanization and increasing environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities has emerged as a forward-thinking approach to address the complex challenges faced by urban areas. Car-free cities propose a transformation in the way we conceive urban life, where private automobiles are either severely restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation options and greener urban environments. This essay explores the idea of car-free cities, emphasizing their potential benefits, challenges, and strategies for effective implementation.  Car-free cities represent a vision of urban living that emphasizes sustainability, health, and community well-being:  Environmental Sustainability: By significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities play a vital role in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.  Public Health: These cities prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, leading to fewer accidents and improved public health. Reduced air pollution levels contribute to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being among urban residents.  Optimal Use of Urban Space: Car-free cities efficiently repurpose urban space by transforming parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Traffic Congestion Reduction: With fewer private cars on the road, traffic congestion is significantly reduced, leading to shorter commutes and a less stressful daily urban experience.  Economic Benefits: Car ownership can be an expensive endeavor. By depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, leading to improved financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents its unique set of challenges:  Resistance to Change: Many individuals rely heavily on their cars for daily activities and commutes. The transition to car-free living may face resistance from those who fear inconvenience and a loss of personal freedom.  Public Transportation Infrastructure: The success of car-free cities depends on the availability and efficiency of public transportation. Substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars.  Economic Impact: Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition. Addressing this economic impact and supporting affected businesses is a crucial aspect of the transition.  Urban Planning and Infrastructure: The reconfiguration of urban areas for car-free living demands comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming process.  Solutions for the successful implementation of car-free cities include expanding and enhancing public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthy goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be retained or changed to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons: certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, attention to swing states, balance between small and large states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

One practical reason for retaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Although disputes over the electoral vote are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. As mentioned in Judge Richard A. Posner's text, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures that the candidate who wins the presidency has a clear majority in the Electoral College, creating stability and certainty in the outcome of the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This requirement eliminates the possibility of a candidate with only regional appeal becoming president, which could lead to feelings of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions. By requiring candidates to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters, the Electoral College promotes more balanced and effective presidency.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, as described by Judge Richard A. Posner. Candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain, leading to more engagement with voters in these states. These voters are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and carefully consider the candidates' messages and policies. By giving these thoughtful voters the opportunity to decide the election, the Electoral College ensures that the most informed and engaged citizens have a significant say in choosing the president.

The Electoral College also balances the political weight of large and small states. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the malapportionment of the Senate gives more weight to small states. The Electoral College provides a counterbalance by giving large states more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as larger states have a greater number of electoral votes. This balance ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are taken into account in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This reduces the complexity and uncertainty of the election process, as demonstrated by the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, who both won a majority in the Electoral College despite having only a plurality of the popular vote. By consistently producing a clear winner, the Electoral College streamlines the election process and avoids additional rounds of voting that could potentially prolong the transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to its practical benefits. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, balances the political weight of small and large states, and prevents the need for run-off elections. While there are valid arguments for a popular vote system, the Electoral College's advantages make it a crucial aspect of our democratic process. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"In the year 2000 there was a presidential election. The two canadate running were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an important question that we the people should be asking, do we really pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? The Electoral College is an out dated system that we keep because the government wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to decide.

The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers and made as a ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifies citizens."" The Electoral College vote on the President and the Vice President. It has 538 members and for there to be a winner a canadate, has to get a majority of 270 electoral votes. Your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional degation. The problem here is that there is 300 million people in this connery and only 538 people get to vote on who is going to be president.

Also most states have a Winner takes all system were the winner of the majority gets all of the votes. For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the majority he will get all 29. Because of this there is not an accurate repisentaion of what the state thinks.

The last reason it is not a good system is because the people's votes do not matter. In the 2000 election Gore had won the peoples votes and Bush had on the Eletoral votes. now Bush became president even tho Gore had won with the people. The biggest problem with the Electoral College is the fact that it over rules the people. If the Eletoral College wins it does not matter how many people vote for the other person running it will not matter.",0

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments for moving to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for several key reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcomes in presidential elections. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, disputes over the outcome of Electoral College votes are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all nature of the electoral votes in most states, as seen in the 2012 election, creates a landslide electoral-vote victory for the winning candidate. While a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely. The Electoral College provides a clear mandate for the future president.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it promotes the idea of a president who represents all regions of the country. In a country as diverse as the United States, it is essential for a president to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College system ensures candidates must have broad support and appeal across multiple regions. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on densely populated areas and disregarding the concerns and interests of citizens in less populous regions.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states incentivizes candidates to engage with a diverse range of voters and understand the unique challenges and needs of different parts of the country. As Judge Posner highlights, swing states receive more attention from candidates, and voters in those states pay closer attention to campaign messages. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as these swing states often play a decisive role in determining the outcome of the election.

The Electoral College also balances the representation of large and small states. While the popular vote can lead to a concentration of attention on densely populated areas, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states are not marginalized in the election process. Large states, such as Florida, receive more attention from candidates due to the number of electoral votes they possess. This ensures that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into account during the election campaign.

Lastly, the Electoral College system prevents the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This is demonstrated by the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, who both won a majority of electoral votes despite not winning a majority of the popular vote. The Electoral College produces a clear winner, eliminating the need for further elections and streamlining the presidential election process.

While there are valid concerns about potential voter apathy in states where the outcome is predetermined, the fact that approximately half of the eligible American population still voted in the 2012 election shows that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, regardless of the system in place.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system maintains certainty of outcomes, ensures a president who represents all regions of the country, promotes thoughtful and informed voting in swing states, balances representation of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These practical reasons, as outlined by Judge Posner, support the retention of the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the various arguments in favor of the Electoral College when making your decision.

"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

There is a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and around the world to limit car usage and create more car-free communities. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and creating more compact and accessible suburbs. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, better public health, and increased social connection.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and improve the quality of our air. For example, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog, and as a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and pollution levels dropped significantly.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. Cars are often the main cause of traffic jams in cities and suburbs. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, or cycling, we can decrease the number of cars on the road and improve traffic flow. This not only reduces the frustration and stress associated with traffic congestion but also saves time and increases productivity. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of people participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams. This event not only promoted alternative transportation but also showcased the potential for a car-free urban environment.

Limiting car usage also has significant health benefits. Cars contribute to air pollution, which can negatively impact respiratory health and increase the risk of lung diseases. By reducing car usage and improving air quality, we can decrease these health risks and improve the overall well-being of communities. Additionally, promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, encourages physical activity, which has numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of obesity and chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help foster social connection and a sense of community. When people rely less on cars and use alternative modes of transportation, they are more likely to interact with their surroundings and engage with their neighbors. This can lead to stronger community bonds, increased social interactions, and a sense of belonging. In car-free communities like Vauban, Germany, residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed without the stress of car ownership.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are manifold. By reducing car dependency, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, promote public health, and foster social connection. As cities and suburbs around the world begin to adopt smart planning principles, it is becoming increasingly clear that a shift away from car culture is not only beneficial for the environment but also for individuals and communities as a whole.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can greatly benefit our society. By reducing the reliance on cars, we can effectively tackle issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, smog, traffic congestion, and even promote a healthier and more active lifestyle.

First and foremost, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can directly reduce the amount of harmful emissions being released into the atmosphere. This has implications not only for the environment but also for public health, as these emissions can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help combat smog and air pollution. The passage about Paris's ban on driving due to smog highlights the negative effects of car emissions on air quality. The smog in Paris rivaled that of heavily polluted cities like Beijing. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. The passage about Bogota's car-free day demonstrates how millions of Colombians chose alternative transportation methods, such as biking, walking, and public transit, resulting in streets free of traffic jams. This not only improves the flow of traffic but also reduces travel times and increases efficiency. By promoting alternative transportation methods, we can alleviate the burden on our roads and make commuting more seamless and enjoyable.

In addition to the environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can also promote a healthier lifestyle. The passage about Vauban, Germany, shows how residents who gave up their cars reported feeling happier and less stressed. By choosing to walk or bike instead of driving, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, leading to improved health and well-being. This can also have positive effects on public health as a whole, as a more active population tends to have lower rates of obesity and chronic diseases.

Overall, there are significant advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion, as well as promoting a healthier lifestyle, we can create more sustainable and livable communities. It is clear that the current efforts to separate suburban life from auto use, as seen in Vauban and other European cities, are a step in the right direction. As more people embrace these changes, we can build a future that is both environmentally conscious and people-centric.",1
"For many years now people have been cutting down on the usage of their cars. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like you become happier, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. many different outcomes come from limiting the amount of time you use your car.

In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they use their cars and the outcome has been phenomenal. Heidrun Walter was asked about how she felt about taking cars out of her life, she answered ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Rosenthal par3. Cars have been liked stress and when cars were taken out of Carlos Arturo plazas life he said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Selsky par24. When cars were taken out of their lifes they felt happier and stress free.

In these last few centuries we have polluted the world more than anyone else has. This is due our technological advances. One of the biggest advance in these centuries is the motor vehicle. The car has now become a household item. Cars are one of the main reasons why our ozone layer is open and we responsible for ""50 percent...of greenhouse gases emissions"" Roseenthal par5. It's shocking to see how far we have advanced but to see how much we have destroyed in the world at the same time is crazy. Paris has become so poluted that they had to get a ""partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer par10. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays intensifying smog"" Duffer par14. Imagine what would happen if cars were reduced in use for a month.

For many people in these countries they have gotten many benefits back. The government has always used ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"" Rosenthal par9. Its shocking how much money goes to bulding roads and not things for the development of our communities. The people in Bogota,Colombia have cut back on their use of their cars anf the money the government usually uses for cars or gas is now going to other things. ""Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city.""Selsky par28. many of the ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" Selsky par28. When the goverment did not have to pay for highways or streets they used that money for parks or smooth sidewalks.

Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like people become happierand stress free, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. If everyone cuts back on the time they use their cars the world would be healthier, the population would be heathier and happier, in addition the government would use money for more important things. Reducing the use of cars is step one in the world becoming healthy again.",0
"There are few people who can can imagine living a full life in this generation without these glorified metal boxes with wheels attached to them even fewer set living a life similar to that as a goal. The advantages of limiting the amount of cars being used are surprisingly unique due to the dwindling amount of disadvantages there are. Some of these advantages include reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and that there will be a reduction in smog. It is always nice to see humanity band together, willingly or forcefully, to work for a common good.

Let us begin with the most pressing issue: preserving the environment. Studies have shown that nearly ""12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" come from passenger cars Rosenthal 1, 5. Reducing these greenhouse gases, which pose a threat to the Earth's atmosphere, would be an improvement, although slow, still an improvement nonetheless. While this would not be the immediately noticeable of changes, making an effort to cleanse our cities of pollution would be.

Moving on, some places have taken this matter into their own hands, matters that some would describe as extreme. Paris, France is one of these examples, ""enforcing a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...motorists...ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine..."" Duffer, 1011.It is pleasant to see a city taking this matter into their own hands. This ban, though, did spark an uproar on the Internet, but it did die down. Many approaches to cleansing cityair have been drastic, but others such as in Columbia, had some sort of event where ""the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Selsky, 21. This did allow a public freedom, despite there still being a fine in place. The remarkable fact of this is that even though cars are being banned, a large portion of the targeted population actually do not mind the change, even ""the rain hasn't stopped people from participating""Selsky, 23.

Suprisingly enough, this carban revolution is still going on today. Many more people are starting to realize the benefits to the ban. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in her article ""The End of Car Culture"" even adds in that many ""sociologists believe...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment...""34. This simply furthers the ideal that humanity as a whole CAN see a chance to change, wants to desperately do so, and WILL do so...eventually.",0
"Cars are usually in most peoples every day lives. We drive them to work, school and many other purposes. Cars have been around for over one hundred years but are people really ready to limit car usage? In a lot of cases around the whole entire world the answer is yes. Their are many reasons to own an automobile, however their is a lot of reasons not to own an automobile as well.

A main topic now around the globe is the environment. Not all cars are going to kill the environment but if you put too many cars in one area it can weaken an environment, this is including cities. Cars can cause a substance called smog which is terrible for the environment or a local residence such as a city or town. As a matter of fact Paris as inforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog of its city. Beijing, China is probably one of smogs worst victims. It is known as one of the most polluted city in the entire world! Sadly, cars are a huge part of the creation of smog. Smog is horrifically bad for the environment for a huge reason, and that reason is not being able to breathe.

Cars take up a lot of space in towns and cities across the entire globe. These areas are packed with roads, that take up many space of the area. imagine what it would be like with no streets, turnpike, roads in general. If you did imagine a world without roads you would see nothing but fields, trees, wildlife of every sort. If not wildlife you would see uncrowned cities with buildings that are close and not so hard to get to. People are adopting this idea around the entire world. These cities are easy and very manageable to go through. The environment is unbelievably clean in these cities and make life in general less of a hastle. This may not be the way of the future but it is a great idea!

Every car has a bad side to them. Not on the car itself but what it can do to you. Cars make a lot of people angry. How do cars make people angry you might ask? Their is a thing in the car community called traffic. If you drive a car chances are you have been in traffic before. Traffic can cause anger which some people like to call road rage. Sadly a lot of people have lost their lives to road rage by getting into car accidents. Car accidents take the lives of many people in the world. A lot of things can take peoples lives but cars cause some of the most deaths in the world. It is not true that a world withot cars would be more safe but the fact is, cars can be a very dangerouse tool.

People use cars almost everywhere in this world but the question still remains, are people ready to limit car usage? Many people have their opinions about car usage and we may never know the answer to this question. If you think about it we have only been driving cars for a little over one hundred years. Us humans have been living on this earth for thousands of years and have been driving cars for only a little over one hundred. Cars are being more produced now than ever and I think will stay progressing for the future years to come. In reality most people need a car to live their lives. The way things are looking like now, chances are needing a car to live a normal life is going to progress in the folowing years of the future.",0
"In the United States, the process to pick the president is rather complicated. From nationwide voting to states that swing from party to party, it has intricate parts that most people find confusing. The electoral college, the process that in the end picks the president, is also rather complicated. It was made to be a compromise of picking the president by votes in congress and popular vote from citizens by the founding fathers. In modern times however, most citizens agree that popular vote makes more sense and that the electoral college has become rather bloated. In the case of finding reasons of why the electoral college doesn't really work is because private citizens vote for someone else to vote and that voters from different states don't control who the electors choose.

First of all, because of the electoral college, citizen's vote counts less when they vote for someone else to vote. Most citizens would relish the chance to vote for the candidate that they choose to support. But when they do vote, their vote only just might sway the electors vote. For example, during the 2000 presidential election, instead of the intended candidate winning the vote, the electoral college choose another. It removes any sense of personal worth when participating in general elections and makes it harder for some candidates to win.

Furthermore, not only do electors choose the president, but the votes themselves from private citizens don't control who the electors choose. Electors are people chosen at state conventions, presidential candidates, and state party's central committees. The amount is chosen on the populations of such states, making smaller states with still a significant population seem insignificant. However, the biggest slight is that the votes made by the citizens don't obligate electors to choose what the general population has already choosen. It takes away control from the ""people"" and is inherently wrong.

In conclusion, the electoral college is rather useless because it does the job that citizens already do and takes away control from them. By voting for electors, the electoral college process takes away a sense of self in elections while giving the power to choose the president to a group of about 200 people that can be persuaded or just simply choosen by the candidates themselves. Its a bloated system and should be dealt with.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from multiple sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. While there are valid concerns raised by those who advocate for a direct popular vote, the Electoral College system has proven to be a necessary and effective compromise that ensures the fair representation of all states and regions in the presidential election.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains in his defense of the Electoral College, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that even if disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote occur, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. The winner-take-all basis of awarding electoral votes in most states also allows even a slight plurality in a state to create a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system provides a clear winner and avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of unity and trans-regional appeal. It requires a presidential candidate to have broad-based support from multiple regions rather than relying solely on a single region. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire country and not just a particular region. As Judge Posner points out, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president as it can lead to residents of other regions feeling disenfranchised and disconnected from the president.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its focus on swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to actively campaign in swing states. This leads to greater engagement and attention from the candidates, as well as more thoughtful and informed voters in those states. By giving swing states a decisive role, the Electoral College empowers these voters to play a significant part in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores a balance between large and small states in the political process. Large states, which have more electoral votes, receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of both large and small states are taken into account. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as mentioned by Judge Posner, gives large states a greater say in the electoral process.

Though there are valid criticisms of the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system leading to candidates focusing only on swing states and the potential for some voters feeling their vote doesn't matter, the benefits of the Electoral College outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides certainty, ensures that the president represents the entire country, encourages candidates to engage with different regions, and maintains a balance between large and small states.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy that should be upheld. Its practical advantages, as outlined by Judge Posner, allow for a fair and effective election process that represents the diverse interests and regions of our great nation. I urge you to consider these arguments when making decisions related to the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Wouldnt it be great to hear that Just by citizens limiting car usage they are kind of making the world a better place? Instead of driving from place to place, they at the park, or taking a nice walk around town, or maybe even having a little fun ice skating. Its exciting to hear by just walking anywhere instead of taking a car or a motor vehicle, you are making the environment better. Also who doesn't love less traffic in the streets? Limiting car usage has so many advantages, you maybe just have to get out of your car to see it. Imagine walking down the street and hearing the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional sound of a distant motor.

In Vauban Germany, most streets are completely car free. Heidrun Walter said ""when i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe, and fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the Untied States. pollution is a huge problem, not only for us but for the environment. Just by limiting cars,you can reduce gas emissions. In the the passage it says that in the untied states, the environmental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost four thousand drivers were fined, and they also had their cars impounded due to some of their reactions to the fine. large traffic went down in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog. In the passage it says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. They blamed diesel fuel because france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. All these car fumes and bad pollution can cause many dangers and car usage has a big part in this problem. By limiting car usage, the smog in paris cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescined the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

In another place, Bogota Colombia, it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of seven million. They did this so they can reduce smog. The people who didnt follow the rules while this day was in progress, they faced twenty five dollor fines. this day can do good for many people and can give you many opportunitys that you havent got to do before. In the passage a businessman named carlos arturo plaza said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" he said that while riding a two seat bicycle with his wife. the usage of cars is not always need, having a little fun wont hurt, taking a walk, going to the park is always a good thing. Even if it rains, that wont stop the people from participating in this day.

Car usage isnt the worst thing in the world but there are many advantages when you dont use them. pollution decreases, as well as smog. you have a day to enjoy the outside world. while you do that think of the gas emmisons you arent putting in the environment. People dont really notice it but pollution has a big effect to global warming. Just by limiting your car usage, you can be doing a favor not only to you but the environment and the world.",0
"The culture of the cars is a easier way of transportation for the people, yet do the people know that these cars are space consumers and cause smog in most areas of the world. By just reducing the amount of cars invarious locations the amount of space would increase the therefore make town or city more accessible for the large population. this change of culture may benefit the population by just having the public transportation and biking.

To begin with the space consuming in suburbs makes it hard most people make a living in the tight area and having the certain parking areas may be the only way to have the space needed to get to where they need to be, yet its all timed. this makes people more tense when they had to worry of a parking spot. The people in Germany weren't allowed to park the sides of the road and have drive ways unless they payed an extra 40,000 along with a home. As said the text vayan, had completed a trend of separating the car use from the suburban life, this is what they called the smart planning. also to include that other areas of the world such as Beijing, China, has to worry more the amount of smog polluting their air and making people ill. In Paris, France, diesel fuel was blamed for the pollution because most of the cars were made up of this fuel. they were rank the most polluted area compared other locations. Therefore to reduce the amount of the complaints of the lack of space and pollution the want to either rid of the cars or just buy more plugincars and hybrids for cleaner air.

Not to mention, that in Bogota, Colombia they completely banned the cars from their country for a day to promote an alternative transportation and reduce the smog. the violators are faced 25 fines. As said the text, the stress level has dropped and therefore has made easier for the people to more around and not get so aggravated. The authorities from other countries came to the event to see what they had in store for the this program, and as said in the text the authorites say that ""these people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders. And in the United States, President Obama has ""ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" Americans are buying fewer cars and are getting fewer licenses. By creating a new network that has the pedestrians have bicycles, private cars and commercial and public transportation. this to show time saved, conserved resources, lower emissions and improve safety. by not just completly getting rid of cars but just reducing it, it may help them to have more smooth system.

To conclude this, the culture of cars has been a issue for someyears and in some areas very diificult to handle therefore they have created a more effiecent way to make life easier for most people. the world has to reduce the smog and increase the space for more compact living and larger populations. By not to get rid of the culture car completly but to just reduce it can be benificial to the people and the world.",0
"Dear Florida Senator, I think we should change our voting system to a popular vote instead of an electoral college. I think this should change because the electoral college has many flaws in it with the way it is done. The popular vote is much more reasonable and practical.

One of the main reasons that I believe we should switch is because of the ""Disaster Factor"". I think that this really stood out to me when researching. According to source two,""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse."" The author is onehundred percent correct. The state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and the electors can ALWAYS deny the will of the people. This would not happen with popular vote because the people's opinion translates directly to who they want as president.

Another reason why the popular vote is the better way to go is because you will never get a tie. With the electoral votes, a tie is possible because there is an even number of electoral votes across the United States. Also, not one citizen of the united States wants a draw because then the House of Representatives would have power and state delegations would vote for the president. The houses decision will almost certainly not reflect the real voice of he people.

My last reason why I believe that the electoral college is unfair to voters is because the swing state votes. If its a tight race all the way to the end and theres only a few states that need to make a final decision, sometimes a small state ultimately changes the end result of the presidency. With the popular vote, this would never happen. The electoral college basically says that some states are more important then others by giving them more say in who is president. Popular vote counts every single person as one.

So after reading my letter I hope you have come come to the conclusion that popular vote is by far better. Electoral College is just old school, not fair, and can cause stupid issues that can easily be avoided with Popular vote. Popular vote will never tie, let others choose who is president besides the people, and would never let a swing state change the destiny of the United States of America.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris, and Bogota showcase the benefits of reducing car dependency and adopting alternative transportation methods. By implementing smart planning and creating car-free zones, these cities have shown that there are considerable advantages to limiting car usage.

One major advantage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be decreased, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment. Vauban, for example, has achieved a 70 percent reduction in car ownership, resulting in lower carbon emissions and improved air quality.

In addition to reducing pollution, limiting car usage can also enhance the overall quality of life. In Vauban, residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up their cars. The absence of cars has created a quieter and more peaceful atmosphere, allowing for more bicycle use and pedestrian-friendly streets. This promotes a greater sense of community and encourages social interaction.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to greater accessibility and convenience. By adopting smart planning techniques, cities can create more compact communities with stores and amenities located within walking or biking distance. This eliminates the need for long and wasteful commutes and encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation. The example of Bogota shows that car-free days can be successful in reducing traffic congestion and providing a more efficient transportation system. This encourages more people to utilize public transportation and shared modes of transportation, resulting in less traffic and greater convenience for all.

Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The example of Paris, where delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the partial driving ban, highlights the potential negative impact on certain industries. However, as the passage suggests, companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already adapting their business models to cater to the changing transportation landscape. By shifting the focus from personal vehicle ownership to alternative modes of transportation, new opportunities for economic growth and innovation can arise.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more accessible and convenient transportation systems, the benefits of limiting car usage are evident. By learning from the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, cities and individuals can embrace this trend and work towards a more sustainable and car-lite future.",1
"The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way on deciding who's president. The electorsal college seem's to have many flaw's that can make voting a disaster. Voter's aren't truely voting for a president, they vote for a slate of candidates who then vote for president.

The worst part about this type of voting is the disaster factor sourse 2:paragraph 11. It clearly says "" segragationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeede in replacing the democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This shows that the results of an electorsal college can sometimes not be decided by the people, but mostly on the electorss of each state. People say the the electorsal college is an easier,cleaner, and faster method, but when it comes for the people to vote for president The electorsal college system wont suit what the people mainly would like.

The electorsal college is an unfair way to vote for president, During the 2000 caspian program, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.sourse 2: paragraph 13. These things shows that the candidates dont care about having the smaller states votes, but wants bigger populated states like california and texas. This is often called a "" Winnertakeall"" system since it each state doesn't get to see what there electors is really all about. Also it can show that with the electorsal college, electorss can vote for a president who is regionally favorable and not nationaly. This can often make the voters feel less satisfied with thier president since there president might not show interest in there opinions.

The Electoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which there is little to no popular votes what so ever. Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College sourse 3: paragraph 22.This goes to show that the Peoples votes dont usually matter when it comes to voting for a president but the electorss do.

Once agian,The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way of deciding who's president. This will be benifitial to many states that want to be involved in the election but feel that there saying in things wouldn't matter.",0
"Dear, state senator I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think this because the Electoral College does not seem fair, the president that usually wins in popular vote loses to the vote for presidency, it is considered a nondemocratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state.

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is not fair to the candidates. This is because most presidents that win the popular vote section of the election then end up losing the presidential vote section, an example of this is when candidate Al Gore received the most individual votes when running against George W. Bush, but Bush won the electoral section, receiving two hundred and seventyone against Al Gore's two hundred and sixtysix. The Electoral college is also unfair to voters, because of all of the states winner takeall system of government, and in seventeen states they did not get a chance to see the candidates. Most people believe the Electoral College is outdated and irrational, a person named Bob Dole, believes that the Electoral College should be completely abolished. Another big problem in the Electoral College is segregationists who do everything to go against certain parties and their candidates, like the time in 1960 a group of segregationists almost succeeded in their effort to get rid of all democratic electors so that new electors would be opposed to John F. Kennedy.

The Electoral College should also be changed to election by popular vote, because people consider it nondemocratic. This is because the voting is all up to the electors selected by each of the different states, meaning that the actual people of the state have no power in the election of the candidates for president. When the people of the state take their vote for the candidates they are actually voting for potential electors who will then go represent the selected candidate, this gives rise to problems like corrupt electors who are dishonest and using cheating tactics, also most states know that their votes will do nothing to help the candidates being represented, examples would be the Democrats in Texas and the Republicans in California. It is also believed that the Electoral College makes potential voters not want to vote at all and they end up not representing their candidates. And most people already have a certainty of the outcome of the election, meaning they already know who will win the election based on the number of votes so far in the popular votes section and the electoral section. The system of electors is also not fair because the people can not control who they are voting for has the electors, and the states number of electors are equal to the number of people on its congressional delegation, which gives big states an advantage over small states.

To conclude this letter, I again say that the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote because, popular vote is fairer then the Electoral College, the people have no power compared to the electors and the are subject to corruption with in the system.",0
"Go outside and take a deep breath, as it is right now you may feel refreshed and may even feel twinge of joy as you just took in a breath of the wonderful natural and clean air. But, as it so happens with the increase of greenhouse gases in the world, in just a few years this may not be the same situation. Instead of enjoying your breath, you may be coughing or choking on the polluted air. In the past few decades, our air pollution has gone up drastically and most of that comes from our cars. According to Source 1, written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars in Europe make up 12 percent of its greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in areas in the United States! That's a whole lot! Rest assured though, there is an easy and crucial way we can begin to cut down those numbers we must begin to limit our car usage.

Already, you may question this and begin to wonder if it is even a possible or logical request. Well, it is in many places throughout the world, communities have begun to forget about their cars and use bikes, walking, and more public transportation options instead of their cars. It can happen, in In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she informs us about an upscale community in Vauban, Germany where its residents have given up their reliance on cars. It's streets have no cars, except for the tram that runs to its downtown areas. While everyone is still allowed to own a car, and some do, they must park it at one of the only two areas to park in large garages where an owner must buy a space for up to 40,000! You may think that it's crazy but in reality it is not. The structure of the city allows almost everything to be in close proximity to one another reducing the need for a car. Many citizens have reported to be feeling better and happier as they feel more carefree and have the stress that cars bring removed from their lives. This helps to reduce the emission produced by cars and Vauban is one of the most successful cities and have been an influence in many areas.

Now, if you are not up to the idea of completely giving up your car then, there are several alternatives that you can do to help and will still reduce and limit your car usage. In Source 3, by Andrew Selsky, Mr. Selsky brings to us a fairly new tradition that started about 3 years ago in Bogota, Colombia. Bogota is Colombia's capital and one of the most populated cities. Bogota has a citywide day called, ""Day Without Cars."" It is simple enough, buses and taxis are only permitted while cars are banned. Millions of people walked, biked, skated, or found other ways of getting to work and frankly enjoyed it. Other citizens reported it as a fun day to take away stress while helping our endangered enviroment. This day that started only 3 days ago has now spread to other areas such as Cali and Valledupar, and Asuncion, Paraguay. Not only do these days help the enviroment but it also helps the citizens. All throughout Bogota, new parks and sports centers have been built, old and cracked sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones, and new areas for income such as restaurants and upscale shopes have popped up around the city as well. The reason for the building and new employment of jobs is so that people will have reasons to walk around and allow for it to be more convient for others who work near by the areas. We also notice a similar idea arise in the lovely city of Paris, France. For those who don't know while Paris is known for it's impressive architecture and beautiful sights, it also has a bad reputation of being very polluted. This pollution comes from the amount of tourists it recieves as well as the different and populous amounts of motor transportation. In Source 2 by Robert Duffer, we see he examines several days in which the city of Paris bans driving due to the record amounts of pollution in the air. For those who were driving when they weren't supposed to be were fined and a few even had their car impounded for their reactions to the fine. Unfortunately, the government established in Paris realized that they had to do this after 5 full days of intensifying smog. At first, many were scared, confused, and even upset as to why this was happening but they began to see that it was neccessary. Once their levels of smog began to normalize, congestion is Paris was down about 60 percent! All in all, we need to begin limiting our usage of cars, from the examples provided it shows that in the end, it isn't such a bad thing after all. It increases, activities to do, work opportunities for people, and reduces air pollution. While, they were able to save Paris this time, next time they may not be so lucky. In the United States, according to Source 4 which is very reliable, we actually see a decrease in car usage overall. These rates have dropped for several reasons, and have about the same results and benefits. People have begun getting healthier, emission rates have decreased.

While the idea of limiting car usage may scare some people, it is proved to be extremely helpful. Limiting car usage helps reduce emissions, and increases job opportunities and everything.",0
"land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democratic electors chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occurred in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exception. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leader, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this responsibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the thoughtful voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winnertakeall rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. As seen in the passages provided, this approach has been successfully implemented in various places around the world, with positive results. By reducing car dependency, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more accessible communities, and promote healthier lifestyles.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can reach up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transit, we can significantly decrease these emissions and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have negative health effects on individuals, especially those with respiratory issues. For example, during a smog episode in Paris, a driving ban was enforced and congestion was reduced by 60 percent, leading to improved air quality (Duffer). Similarly, in Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited, residents enjoy cleaner air and a quieter environment free from car noise pollution (Rosenthal).

By limiting car usage, we can also create more accessible communities. In many suburbs, cars are the main mode of transportation, leading to sprawl and the need for extensive parking facilities. However, smart planning initiatives, like those seen in Vauban and other places, encourage compact development and prioritize accessibility to public transportation and amenities within walking or biking distance (Rosenthal). This approach not only reduces the reliance on cars but also fosters more vibrant and livable communities where people can easily access the services they need.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. In car-centric societies, people often spend a significant amount of time sitting behind the wheel, leading sedentary lives. By promoting alternatives such as walking or biking, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, leading to improved health and well-being. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was instituted, leading millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or take public transport instead of driving (Selsky). This event not only reduced congestion but also encouraged physical activity among citizens.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating more accessible communities, and promoting healthier lifestyles. As demonstrated in various examples from around the world, smart planning initiatives and car-free events can lead to positive outcomes for both individuals and the environment. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and reevaluating our dependence on cars, we can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversible but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethora of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeavors.

To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will accumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumulative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says ""Green house gas emitions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emitions in the country."" America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas emitions to start with but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations and some smart city planning. The benefits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.

Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. instead you can leisurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now."" This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant ""where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drowned out the occasional distant motor."" This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would disagree with such an environment.

Now traveling all the way across the world, from Germany to Columbia. These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogata The capital of Columbia, they actually organize ""Car free days"" seven million people in Bogota alone participated in the event, violaters would even have to pay a 25 fine. According to Andrew Selsky, the author of Car Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogoto, ""Even the rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration and it has great effects on the environment.

In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues. If people stay on track it will be easy, fun, relaxing and the Earth will be admired for many years to come.",0
"The presidential elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the electoral Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the electoral Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the electoral Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jeopardize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system.

To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the electoral Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campaigns and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says "" If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour electoral votes. Who are the electors?"" amd in source 1 it says ""THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise."" But honest is it really a compromise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn't live up to American values.

Another reason that you shouldn't support the electoral Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jeopardize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidential elections you can't, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that ""Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves.

The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the electoral System is because of the ""Winners take all"" system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all."" This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote.

However even in the midst of all that wrong with electoral System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed."" Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don't know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's even a lie. We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance?

To reiterate the bottom line is that these electoral Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the ""Winner takes all system."" Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.",0

Subject: Supporting the Electoral College to Preserve the Integrity of Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections, as opposed to replacing it with a popular vote system. Although there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, I believe that the Electoral College provides greater certainty of outcome, ensures that candidates have broad national appeal, promotes engagement in swing states, restores balance for large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a definitive outcome in presidential elections. Unlike a popular vote system, where disputes over the counting and legitimacy of individual votes can initiate prolonged legal battles, the Electoral College offers a more succinct process that allows for a resolution to be reached. This was evident in the close 2000 election, which would have been further complicated and potentially led to a constitutional crisis if it were solely determined by the popular vote. The Electoral College system avoids such uncertainties and provides more stability in the democratic process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the need for presidential candidates to have widespread appeal across different regions. A candidate must secure support from multiple states to accumulate the required electoral votes, promoting campaigns that focus on the concerns of various communities across the country. This prevents candidates from solely targeting populous states or demographic strongholds, which would result in regional favoritism and disregard the interests of citizens in other areas. By maintaining the Electoral College, we ensure that every state and its residents receive attention and representation throughout the campaign process.

In addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates to engage with and address the concerns of swing states. These states, which have a history of voting for different parties in different elections, hold significant influence in determining the outcome of the presidential race. By concentrating campaign efforts in swing states, candidates are incentivized to tailor their platforms and policies to the needs and preferences of these diverse electorates. This increases voter engagement and allows for a more informed decision-making process by citizens who are most likely to directly impact the election's outcome.

Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance for large states. Due to the unequal distribution of electoral votes across states, candidates are motivated to campaign in highly populated regions, even if those states are not consistently aligned with their party affiliation. This ensures that densely populated states, such as California and Texas, do not monopolize political attention, allowing smaller states to have a voice and participate actively in the presidential elections. The Electoral College system accounts for the diverse interests of states and ensures that all citizens have a fair opportunity to influence the election outcome.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the presidential election process. By requiring a candidate to secure an absolute majority of electoral votes, the system avoids the need for additional rounds of voting when no candidate receives a majority in the popular vote. This efficiency saves time and resources and ensures the election process proceeds smoothly.

While some argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in solidly partisan states, it is important to note that individual votes rarely determine presidential elections. The idea that a single vote may be the deciding factor is not a common expectation among voters. Despite this, the percentage of voter turnout remains consistently high in presidential elections, indicating that people participate in the electoral process to express their political preferences rather than to influence the outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides a time-tested framework that maintains the integrity of presidential elections. Its retention ensures that outcomes are not subject to prolonged disputes, candidates possess national appeal, swing states receive adequate attention, large states are not disproportionately favored, and run-off elections are avoided. I encourage you to consider these points when evaluating potential changes to the election process and to support the continuation of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes then the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. Thats why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.

Just like the 2000's election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know its a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. Thats why it should be casted on popular so its fair for people and not on the size of your state.

The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all of the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to calculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system becausein several places they never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.

Also you can tie the votes in electoral votes and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. Its not fair for most people and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completly unfair.

The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting so it'll be more fair and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. Thats why i think it should be casted on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.",0
"Cars are becoming a must in today's society. In some places, people live and survive without a motorized vehicle. People don't have to stop using cars altogether, but should be able to limit themselves to save of world from pollution creating a better environment to live in.

Some people don't understand the severity of pollution and how much cars contribute to that. Pollution is said to become Earths demise, with cars producing and letting out so much smog, it seems as if the Earths demise could be near. According to Robert Duffer, Paris has ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidence of Paris giving a partial ban shows how detrimental cars can have on Earth environment. Further examination reveals, a situation where Bogota has even issued a "" carfree day"" stated by Andrew Selsky. This source shows us that with even one day without using a car could be a useful plan for all places. People of today don't need to not use their cars, just use their cars either less per day or per week.

Although some may say, we need cars to get to work or to go to the grocery store, they can always just use public transportation. Buses are already running even if you are in a car so why not use them instead of polluting the air even more. In Bogota, when they have their carfree day, most people either ""hiked"",""biked"", ""skated"" or ""took buses"" as a mean of transportation. More evidence shows a scenario where the Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging a ""car reduced"" community, stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Resources such as this one shows that if the United States environmental Protection Agency is concerned about our pollution rate why shouldn't we? If we cut down on our use of cars, pollution rate can drop extremely down causing a better living environment.

When you stop to think why cars have become so prevelant, there is no exact reasoning. If we don't even know our exact reasoning for having a car, in a case that we can't rely on buses or our own two legs to provided why are we risking the safty of our Earth in order to use them? Cars aren't the slightest bit the problem, how and how often we use them is becoming the problem, if we limit our use of cars our advantage would be the single best thing in live, happiness and peace of life.",0
"It is becoming increasingly evident that there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage in modern society. The passage set provides several examples of communities and cities that are taking steps to reduce dependence on cars, and the positive outcomes they have experienced. Limiting car usage not only proves to be beneficial for the environment but also for the overall well-being of individuals and communities.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can effectively decrease these emissions and work towards combating climate change. The passage on Paris's driving ban due to smog highlights the positive impact of such measures. The ban resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and smog levels, improving the air quality and overall health of the city's residents.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion, making transportation more efficient. The passage on the car-free day in Bogota showcases how millions of Colombians embraced alternative modes of transportation, resulting in empty streets and reduced traffic jams. This not only saves time for commuters but also contributes to a more sustainable and accessible transportation system. By promoting alternatives such as walking, biking, and public transportation, cities can alleviate congestion, improve mobility, and enhance the overall quality of life for their residents.

Limiting car usage also encourages a shift towards more sustainable and healthy modes of transportation. The passage on Vauban, Germany, demonstrates how individuals can adopt a car-free lifestyle and experience increased happiness and reduced stress levels. This is further supported by the passage on the decrease in car ownership and driving in the United States. The trend suggests a cultural shift towards prioritizing alternative transportation options, such as walking or using public transportation, which can have positive impacts on physical and mental health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for urban planning to become more focused on the needs of residents rather than accommodating cars. By reducing the need for large parking areas, cities can prioritize creating community spaces, such as parks and pedestrian-friendly streets. This can enhance social interactions and create vibrant neighborhoods. The passage on Vauban's approach to smart planning emphasizes the placement of stores within walking distance, promoting pedestrian activity and reducing the need for long car trips to access essential amenities.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and diverse. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, promoting sustainable and healthy transportation, and creating vibrant communities, limiting car usage proves to be a vital step in creating a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace this concept and work towards implementing policies and initiatives that encourage alternative modes of transportation.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of whether or not to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the following reasons: certainty of outcome, representation of all regions, emphasis on swing states, balance of power for big states, and avoidance of run-off elections.

Firstly, the certainty of outcome is a crucial aspect of the Electoral College. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, the electoral vote winner almost always reflects the winner of the popular vote. This provides a sense of legitimacy to the electoral process and reduces the likelihood of disputes. While there have been cases like the 2000 election that were contested, these situations are rare and do not outweigh the benefits of the Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal and does not solely represent specific regions. Due to the requirement of winning a majority of electoral votes, presidential candidates must campaign nationwide and consider the interests of all regions. This prevents a candidate from focusing solely on densely populated areas or regions where they have overwhelming support, and promotes a more balanced representation of the entire country.

Thirdly, the emphasis on swing states is a positive attribute of the Electoral College. In a system where each state's electoral votes are determined by a winner-take-all principle, candidates are encouraged to campaign in swing states. This increases voter engagement and attentiveness, as these states play a critical role in deciding the outcome of the election. It ensures that these states receive more attention and consideration from candidates, thereby deepening the democratic process.

Fourthly, the Electoral College allows big states to maintain some political weight in the selection of the president. While the Senate's mal-apportionment may skew political power in favor of smaller states, the Electoral College balances this inequality. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives in the House of Representatives, big states receive proportionally more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that their concerns and issues are adequately addressed.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. Since the winner is determined by securing a majority of electoral votes, there is a reduced likelihood of having no candidate receive a majority in the initial election. This feature of the Electoral College guarantees a clear and decisive winner, preventing the need for additional rounds of voting and potential political turmoil.

While critics argue that the Electoral College does not provide fairness or adequate representation to all voters, I would counter that the system is designed to be pragmatic and effective. It serves as a compromise between a direct popular vote and a vote in Congress, reflecting the wisdom of the founding fathers. Additionally, it prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated areas, leading to a more balanced representation of the diverse interests and concerns of the entire nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an integral part of our democratic process and should be retained. It provides certainty of outcome, guarantees representation for all regions, promotes voter engagement in swing states, balances the power of big states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. I respectfully urge you to consider these points when deliberating on any potential changes to the electoral system.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will take these arguments into account and make an informed decision that best serves the interests of the American people.

Sincerely,

"Dear Florida state senator, The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is nondemocratic way in most people's eyes.

Although, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.

I said it was a nondemocratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of independence was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.

Speaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outrageously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and california has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.

In the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a nondemocratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states.",0
"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city andor regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a timeconsuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almostbroken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semitrucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashesaccidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bikesharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridgetunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our numberone priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to it's the journey.",0
"""The day that mankind realizes that their creations destroy the true beauty of mother nature it will be too late."" This quote by one of our nations greatest political and environmental activists, Irvin Green, directly applies to the topic of reducing pollution. One simple, yet extremely effective way to reduce pollution is limiting the transportation methods we travel by. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place.

In many places such as Germany, Paris, and Columbia, many ambitious ideas are being put into play to help battle pollution. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it is stated that in Vauban Germany, 70 percent of families do not own vehicles. The other 30% that do, do not have a place to park them, making them basically useless. Residents in Vauban have stopped their need for transportation, making malls and stores a walk away. In this new approach, pollution has drastically reduced in numbers and has made it a much safer and cleaner place to live.

The usage of vehicles are a doubleedged sword. They may get us to where we need to go with plenty of time to spare, but what are we really losing because of it? What we are losing is the environment and also our health. In Paris, the pollution rate almost reached a new record high, thus forcing the partial driving pan to clear the air of the global city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", its evident that cars hurt us in more ways then we realize. businesses are suffering due to the lack of transportation available to delivery their services as seen in source number two, ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue"". ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of france after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The smog was so dense that Paris officials created a law making evennumbered license plates to leave there cars at home to reduce pollution. With half of the normal amount of cars driving, it almost elimated the total accident rate, making the road a safer place to be.

Despite the benefits that come along with transportation, there are more disadvanges then advantages. Pollution is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants. Many sociologist have seen these statistics and have also noticed that American transportation usuage has slowly been declining since its peak in 2005. People are slowly but surely helping the cause in their own ways, whether its by delaying getting there license, limit there driving, or even carpooling with friends. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place to be.",0
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Cars have become an integral part of suburban life, but recent trends show that limitations on car usage can have significant advantages. The articles from Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky provide evidence of the benefits of reducing car dependency in various cities around the world. These advantages include a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, decreased traffic congestion, and the promotion of alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to a healthier environment. For example, Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality (Duffer).

Another advantage is the decrease in traffic congestion. When cars are limited, roads become less crowded, making commuting faster and more efficient. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are mostly forbidden, streets are car-free, allowing for smoother and quieter transportation (Rosenthal). Similarly, during a car-free day in Bogota, the capital city of Colombia, millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, leading to streets devoid of traffic jams (Selsky). By reducing car usage, cities can alleviate traffic congestion and improve the overall quality of transportation.

In addition to reducing congestion, limiting car usage also promotes alternative modes of transportation. When cars are less relied upon, people are more likely to use public transportation, walk, bike, or carpool. Vauban, for example, has made their community more accessible to public transportation and placed stores within walking distance (Rosenthal). This type of smart planning not only reduces the need for personal vehicles but also encourages a healthier, more active lifestyle. Bogota's car-free day has also encouraged people to explore alternative methods of transportation, such as biking and taking buses, which helps promote a more sustainable and efficient transportation system (Selsky).

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. Rosenthal mentions that the decrease in driving in the United States has resulted in fewer car purchases, which may impact the car industry. However, this shift in behavior can lead to the emergence of new opportunities. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, focusing on a broader range of transportation options beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal). This adaptation to changing preferences can create a more diverse and sustainable transportation industry.

In conclusion, limiting car usage provides numerous advantages to individuals and society as a whole. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease traffic congestion, promote alternative modes of transportation, and stimulate economic innovation. As cities around the world adopt strategies to reduce car dependency, it is important to recognize the benefits of these limitations and continue to explore ways to create more sustainable and efficient transportation systems.",1
"  A Sustainable Urban Vision  In an increasingly urbanized world, the concept of car-free cities is gaining momentum as a revolutionary approach to re-envision urban living. These cities propose a fundamental shift away from private automobiles, either through severe restrictions or outright bans, and in doing so, they advocate for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a paradigm shift in urban living, focusing on sustainability, health, and community well-being. They offer a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, but transitioning to this model is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the key benefits of car-free cities is their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. Efficient use of urban space is a central theme in car-free cities, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Less reliance on private cars translates to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and lower stress levels for urban inhabitants. Furthermore, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. Redesigning urban areas for car-free living is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthwhile aspiration. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from various sources, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the following reasons:

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides a certainty of outcome that a popular vote system may not always guarantee. As suggested by Judge Richard Posner in his article, under the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the election results are decisive and conclusive. In contrast, disputes over the popular vote can be more likely, as seen in the 2000 election. The Electoral College, with its higher threshold for victory, reduces the chance of such disputes and promotes stability in the election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president is not solely focused on one region or interest group. As Posner explains, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This leads to a more balanced representation of the country's interests and prevents the concentration of power in one region. The residents of all regions can feel that their voices are heard and that the president represents their diverse interests. This fosters a sense of unity and inclusiveness across the nation.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states and closely contested regions. This is crucial because it leads to more thoughtful campaigning and engagement with the voters in these areas. As mentioned by Posner, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and carefully assess the competing candidates' policies and platforms. This promotes meaningful voter participation and engagement, as well as a robust exchange of ideas during the campaign period.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between the interests of large and small states. Posner argues that due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, large states lose some weight in the political balance. The Electoral College helps restore this weight by awarding electoral votes based on population size. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on large states at the expense of small states. Every state, regardless of size, has the opportunity to influence the outcome of the election and have their interests represented.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections, which can be complicated and time-consuming. With the Electoral College, a clear winner is determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular vote. As Posner notes, this was the case for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. The Electoral College reduces the pressure for run-off elections and provides a more efficient and streamlined election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has its merits and should be retained. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes balanced representation, encourages thoughtful campaigning, balances the interests of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and fair method for electing the president of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider these points when making decisions regarding the electoral process.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a system of election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides important benefits and should be retained.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the candidate who wins the Electoral College vote usually also wins the popular vote. This means that the President who is elected has a clear majority of the electoral votes and represents a broad range of states. In contrast, a direct popular vote system could lead to disputes over the result, as shown by the 2000 election. The Electoral College's winner-take-all system ensures that the winning candidate has a decisive victory in each state, providing a clearer mandate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who is representative of the entire nation. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the requirement for trans-regional appeal means that candidates must reach out beyond their regional bases, ensuring that they address the needs and concerns of diverse populations across the country. This helps to prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and leaving large portions of the country feeling disenfranchised. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed choices.

The Electoral College also benefits smaller states and provides a balance of power between states with different populations. In his defense of the Electoral College, Judge Posner argues that the big states would dominate the election process if it were based solely on popular vote. By attributing electoral votes based on the number of representatives and senators each state has, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political balance of large and small states. This ensures that candidates cannot simply focus their campaigns on heavily populated areas and neglect the interests of less populated regions.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This allows for a clear winner to be determined in a timely manner, preventing prolonged election processes and potential challenges to the results. The certainty provided by the Electoral College ensures that the will of the people is respected and a president is elected without ambiguity.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a valuable and essential part of our democratic system. It provides a clear outcome, ensures representation for all regions of the country, prevents dominance by large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a direct popular vote, these benefits should not be overlooked. I urge you to advocate for the preservation of the Electoral College in our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. It not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also promotes healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. The passage set provides several examples of how limiting car usage has been successfully implemented in different parts of the world and the positive outcomes that have resulted from it.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a large portion of these emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes healthier lifestyles. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and rely on alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. This not only eliminates the stress associated with car ownership but also encourages physical activity, leading to improved health and well-being. As one resident mentioned, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This demonstrates the positive impact of limiting car usage on both mental and physical health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more sustainable and accessible communities. The concept of ""smart planning"" mentioned in the passage set focuses on separating suburban life from auto use. This includes placing stores within walking distance on main streets instead of distant malls, as seen in Vauban. By doing so, communities become more compact and accessible to public transportation, reducing the need for cars and creating a more sustainable living environment.

In addition, limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality in urban areas. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. The ban also had exceptions for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars with three or more passengers, encouraging the use of more eco-friendly transportation options. This example shows how limiting car usage can have immediate and positive effects on air quality and traffic flow.

Furthermore, the passage set highlights the trend of decreasing car ownership and driving in the United States. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This cultural shift not only has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment but also challenges the traditional car industry. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies, recognizing the need to adapt to changing consumer behavior.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of healthier lifestyles, creation of sustainable communities, alleviation of traffic congestion, and improvement of air quality. The passage set provides examples of successful implementations of car-free initiatives in different parts of the world and the positive outcomes that have resulted from them. As we continue to prioritize sustainable living, limiting car usage should be an integral part of our efforts to create a greener and more sustainable future.",1
"Limiting car usage has numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia provide evidence for the advantages of reducing car dependency in communities.

One of the major advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States (passage 5). By implementing car-free policies in communities like Vauban, emissions can be drastically reduced. This is crucial in combating climate change and improving air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage can contribute to a decrease in congestion and traffic-related pollution, as seen in the case of Paris (passage 14).

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative modes of transportation. In Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking spaces are limited, 70 percent of families do not own cars and rely on bicycles or public transportation (passage 3). This not only reduces individual carbon footprints but also creates a more active and healthier lifestyle for residents. Similarly, the car-free day in Bogota encourages people to walk, bike, or take public transit, promoting a shift towards alternative transportation methods (passage 25).

Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. In Vauban, homes are designed without driveways or garages, allowing for more space for housing and green areas (passage 2). This helps create a more compact and sustainable community. Furthermore, the reduction in car usage can result in cost savings for individuals. The decrease in car ownership and the increase in car-sharing and public transportation options have the potential to lower expenses related to owning and maintaining a private vehicle.

Overall, limiting car usage offers multiple advantages for individuals and communities alike. It helps combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, promotes active and healthier lifestyles, reduces congestion, and can lead to economic benefits. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on both the environment and quality of life.",1
"Many people argue over the fact that the Electoral College is beneficial or not. I'm writing this letter to you Mr. Senator to explain the good and bad effects the Electoral College has. The Electoral College is a process, it is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College keeps the elections balanced, it keeps the elections organized. It may have some bad effects. For example, many argue that the people's votes aren't what choose the president.

The Electoral College maintains the elections balanced, ""It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast."" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment.

Another beneficial effect the Electoral College presents is the organization of the election for President. As said in the article, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year."" The Electoral College is what maintains everything professional.

The Electoral College may have some effect that aren't positive. For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, ""The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism.

People may have different opinions about Electoral College. People have different opinions about everything. I wanted to explain how the Electoral College benefits our society and how it doesn't. It keeps the elections balanced, organized, but it makes others feel like their vote isn't worthy or valuable. I hope this letter helps you with your opinion and how you feel about the Electoral College.",0
"Limiting car usage has many advantages for both individuals and the environment. As highlighted in the passage set, reducing car dependency can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease traffic congestion, and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, individuals can contribute to lowering these emissions and combating climate change. This is particularly important given the ambitious goals to curb emissions put forth by President Obama.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage set mentions that automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, which often leads to congested roads. By adopting a ""smart planning"" approach, as seen in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and public transportation is made more accessible, we can create more compact and efficient communities. This can help ease traffic congestion and make commuting easier and more efficient for everyone.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage set highlights how smog became a major issue in cities like Paris and Bogota when car usage was not regulated. By implementing measures such as car-free days or partial driving bans, cities can significantly reduce air pollution and improve the health and well-being of their citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation. Encouraging walking, biking, and the use of public transit not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes physical activity and better health. As mentioned in the passage set, the development of bike paths and the availability of public transportation can make these modes of transport more attractive and accessible to people.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion to improving air quality and promoting healthier modes of transportation, the benefits are significant. As we continue to see a shift in behavior and a decrease in car dependency, it is important to embrace smart planning and invest in the development of sustainable communities that prioritize alternative forms of transportation. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for all.",1

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I write this letter to express my support for the current Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, serves as a vital compromise that ensures the nation's diverse interests are represented, maintains the stability of our elections, and upholds the principles of federalism.

One of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's publication, ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" However, the Electoral College system has actually proven to be more reliable for determining the winner of the presidential election. In most cases, the candidate with the most electoral votes also wins the popular vote. This stability prevents prolonged disputes over election outcomes, as witnessed during the 2000 election crisis discussed by Bradford Plumer in his article.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected as a representative of all regions and prevents the dominance of a single geographic area. Judge Richard A. Posner also highlights this point by stating, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" By having candidates campaign in various states, the Electoral College encourages them to address the concerns and needs of voters from different regions. This system promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"" and prevents any one region from feeling as if their votes do not count or that the President will not consider their interests.

The Electoral College also gives importance to swing states, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are likely to provide more detailed information and pay closer attention to the concerns of swing state voters. This results in more thoughtful voting and better-informed decisions, as these voters have a greater impact on the election outcome. In contrast, a popular vote system may lead to candidates only focusing on densely populated areas or major urban centers, leaving the rest of the country with little to no representation or influence in the election process.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to give weight to large states in the political balance. With the mal-apportionment of the Senate, small states have an inherent advantage in terms of representing their interests. However, the Electoral College balances this out by providing more attention to large states during campaigns. Without the Electoral College, candidates may overlook the concerns of less populous states, resulting in the majority's tyranny over the minority.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the complications and additional costs associated with run-off elections, allowing for a clear and decisive winner to be determined swiftly. The certainty provided by the Electoral College system is essential in maintaining the stability of our democratic process.

While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, such as promoting a more direct form of democracy, it is important to consider the practical benefits of the Electoral College. This system allows for the representation of diverse interests, ensures a stable outcome, and prevents the domination of a specific region or majority. The potential drawbacks of a popular vote system, including the disenfranchisement of voters from noncompetitive states and the risk of lengthy and disputed elections, cannot be ignored.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College system when evaluating any potential changes to our election process. It is a system that has served our nation well, maintaining the stability of our democracy for over two centuries. Amending or replacing it without careful consideration and a thorough examination of the alternatives could have unintended consequences.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take into account the various perspectives and practical benefits associated with the Electoral College system.

Sincerely,

"It is in the best interest of the people that you do away with the Electoral College. When people vote, they want it to be a direct vote to the election, not a vote for their chosen candidate's electors. The Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.

To begin, the Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote. As stated before, when you vote, there is no say in who actually wins the election. You are voting for electors who then vote for the President. While it is a rare occurrence, those Electors may betray you and vote for the other party, cancelling your vote totally out. If a candidate gets the most popular votes, that doesn't guarantee them as President, because they still have to get the Electoral College's votes. In the third source titled, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, it reads, ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888."" This sentence means that President Bush won with fewer popular votes and more electoral votes. If their was no Electoral College, Al Gore would've won the election. The people would've thought that Al Gore was going to win, and they were probably in for a surprise when they saw that Bush had won with fewer popular votes. It just goes to show that an election can go either way, and there is no closure for a candidate until it is actually announced who won.

Next, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people. Say a Republican candidate gets a majority of the popular votes, but the Democratic candidate wins because he is chosen by the Electoral College. The people of the United States might actually feel betrayed because they felt that the Republican party could benefit the economy and society best, and that President might not be uptopar and disappoint the people. Also in the third article, it reads ""...to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" The statement really says a lot about both sides of the argument. If there is an Electoral College and if their isn't an Electoral College, people could still feel this way. If a candidate who has less popular votes wins, then those states that voted for himher might feel as if they ""will have no regard for their interests"".

Lastly, swing voters could cause a catastrophe. Swing states could be considered manipulative because they all know that the popular vote rests in their hands. Will it be Democratic or Republican? You never know. The candidates focus mainly on campaigning in these states because these are the ones that are half and half, states such as Ohio. While there are thoughtful voters, there are also ones who could care less about who the President is and just want to keep America on the edge of her seat while they decide who they want to vote for. In the second source, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" is says ""In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" The states are swing states and they truly determine the fate of the election. As said before, those states get the most attention from the candidates, who try to make themselves as appealing as possible. In the second source as well, the author says ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Rhode Island and South Carolina are states that are almost entirely for one party so there is no use in the opposite party going there to try and persaude them to change their minds because it is most likely not going to happen. While they may feel neglected, it's just how it is.

To conclude, the Electoral College should be banished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection cannot be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.",0

Subject: A Case for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, serves an essential purpose in maintaining the fairness and integrity of our democratic process.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the electoral vote winner has always exceeded the popular vote winner, ensuring a clear victor. This reduces the likelihood of prolonged disputes and allows for a smooth transition of power. In contrast, a direct popular vote system may lead to an increase in disputes, as the winner would only need a slight plurality of votes to claim victory.

Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that every region in our country has a voice and enables candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Without this system, a candidate with strong regional support would have no incentive to campaign in other regions, leading to a fragmented nation and a president who does not represent the interests of all Americans. By requiring presidential candidates to have support across multiple regions, the Electoral College promotes national unity and inclusivity.

Additionally, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states. This ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns and needs of these states, where decisions on the outcome of the election are often made. Voters in swing states receive more attention and information from the candidates, allowing them to make more informed decisions. This promotes voter engagement and thoughtful decision-making, resulting in a higher-quality election process.

The Electoral College also balances the political weight of big and small states. While the House of Representatives is designed to provide proportional representation based on population, the Electoral College guarantees that smaller states have a voice in the election process. This prevents larger states from dominating the presidential election and allows for a more equitable representation of all states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures the selection of a clear winner. This simplifies the election process and avoids the complications and costs associated with run-off elections.

Critics argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. However, the fact that both conservative and liberal voices have supported its abolition speaks to its non-partisan nature. The system has proven to be effective for over two centuries and has only failed to align with the popular vote a handful of times. This demonstrates the system's overall accuracy and reliability.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages broad appeal by candidates, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance between big and small states, and avoids the necessity of run-off elections. I urge you, Senator, to consider these reasons when discussing the future of our presidential election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College, as it upholds the principles of fairness, accountability, and representation that our country was founded on.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system, despite the growing calls to replace it with a popular vote for the president of the United States. While I appreciate the arguments against the Electoral College, I believe there are compelling reasons to retain this system. 

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that the winning candidate has a clear majority of electoral votes. This minimizes the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. By maintaining a margin of victory in multiple states rather than relying solely on the popular vote, the Electoral College offers a more stable and definitive outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents all regions of the country. With the requirement of obtaining trans-regional appeal, candidates must campaign throughout the nation and address the concerns of voters in all states. This prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated regions or swing states, as they must seek support from a diverse range of voters. The Electoral College guarantees that the president is everyone's president, fostering a sense of national unity.

Thirdly, the Electoral College emphasizes the importance of swing states in the electoral process. By allocating electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, candidates are encouraged to campaign in swing states and effectively address the concerns of their residents. This system prompts candidates to engage with voters in these states more extensively, leading to a better-informed electorate. It ensures that swing states have a say in deciding the outcome of the election and encourages candidates to craft policies that benefit these crucial regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College gives due consideration to the influence and representation of large states. Due to the allocation of electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, large states have a greater impact on the presidential election. This balance of power ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are taken into account, preventing regions with higher populations from dominating the election outcomes.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. With the possibility of a candidate winning a majority of electoral votes without winning the popular vote, run-off elections are unnecessary. This saves significant time, money, and resources that would otherwise be devoted to holding additional elections. The Electoral College streamlines the election process and produces clear winners, avoiding prolonged political uncertainty.

Although some argue that the Electoral College discourages voters in states where they know their candidate has no chance of winning, the data from the 2012 election show that voter turnout remains high. Voters are motivated by their desire to express their political preferences and participate in the democratic process, despite their awareness of the system.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It ensures certainty of outcome, provides trans-regional appeal for the president, emphasizes the importance of swing states, gives weight to large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the electoral system may have flaws, its benefits far outweigh the potential disadvantages. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in the best interest of our nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Subject: Support for the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that contribute to a fair and balanced democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College system was established as a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, as outlined in the Constitution. This compromise ensures that the interests of both individual citizens and states as sovereign entities are taken into account. The Electoral College strikes a balance by giving each state a voice in the election based on its representation in Congress, thereby preventing larger states from effectively silencing the concerns of smaller states.

Additionally, the Electoral College guarantees that the outcome of the presidential election is certain, preventing potentially divisive and protracted disputes. As evidenced by the 2000 election, where the popular vote winner did not secure the presidency, a direct popular vote system could lead to disputes and challenges that undermine the stability of our democratic process. The Electoral College, on the other hand, ensures that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always surpasses their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and accepted outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters and regions. With the winner-take-all distribution of electoral votes in most states, candidates have an incentive to campaign and address the concerns of voters in a variety of states, rather than solely focusing on heavily populated metropolitan areas. This ensures that candidates engage with a diverse range of citizens and understand their needs, leading to a more representative and effective presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College reinforces the political balance between large and small states. Under a direct popular vote system, candidates would be more likely to concentrate their campaigns in highly populous states, potentially disregarding the unique challenges and opinions of citizens in smaller states. By giving each state a proportional number of electoral votes based on its representation in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a voice in the presidential election and encourages candidates to consider their concerns.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections, which can complicate the presidential election process and perpetuate uncertainty. Runoff elections, as seen in other countries, can be costly, time-consuming, and often fail to produce a clear winner. The Electoral College, by design, eliminates the need for runoffs and consistently produces a single, decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system, while not perfect, provides a fair and balanced process for electing the President of the United States. Its representation of states' interests, certainty of outcome, promotion of broad appeal, support for political balance, and avoidance of run-off elections are crucial to our democratic ideals and the strength of our nation. I respectfully urge you to consider these points and support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your dedicated service and for considering my perspective on this matter. I look forward to your continued leadership and support.

Sincerely,

"Transportation has been a part of society for as long as the worlds been turning. It all depends what mode of transport you are willing to take on a daily basis. Cars are becoming fewer and fewer in some places of the past few years. People are less dependant on personal transportation which in turn creates a safer, healthier environment for ourselves and the others around us.

By limiting car usage the main reaction would be less pollution and less smog in larger cities. Places like New York, Paris, Berlin, London, or Beijing could look so much better. Everywhere you look you see and hear about pollution and Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming. All this is caused mainly by humans hand and the cars we drive spitting out toxic Carbon Dioxide wastes. In Paris they had a one day ban of half the cars in the city and the smog went away in that amount fo time.Source 2 If we limited cars we could unlimit our world to a new, longer lifespan, because cars are truly ripping our planet to pieces.

The chance of finding public transportation in America is very slim. Most places you go don't have subways or things like ""der UBahn"" in Deutschland. Our country is made for cars and we throw money at them every year which will eventually come to bite America in the butt. 80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways and the rest goes to other types of transport in America.Source 1 By creating more viable public transportation methods we could cut the spending on highways and put the money back into public transportation. By doing so we could limit accidents at the wheel and reduce pollution which I mentioned earlier. We already know that this system works in Vauban, Deutschland where residents rarely own cars and they live happier, quainter lives. Source 1 The time to by a car is not now. Recent studies show that car purchases, licenses, and driving has become fewer as each year goes on.Source 4 Either from high vehicle and gas prices or an actual social spectical, driving is slowly decreasing all over the world. Hopefully within the next 25 years, public transportation will be a MUST in cities all over the globe, and I'm not just talking about buses. People are more reliant on planes and trains in Europe than any other continent. And we could benefit highly from what we learn elsewhere.

If we just join together and stop driving altogether for just one day, the results would be both extraordianry and frightening. We have neglected to see that by not limiting our car usage we have limited our time on this planet. Hopefully our generation will correct the wronging of past generations and improve transportation so it isn't such a loud and obnoxtious hinderence.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Choosing the President

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a direct popular vote, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is imperative for several practical reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As highlighted in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed his or her share of the popular vote. With the majority of states opting for a winner-take-all system, even a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide victory in terms of electoral votes. Consequently, a tie in the electoral vote is highly unlikely, providing stability and a clear winner.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as observed by Judge Posner. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to determine the outcome, necessitating a candidate with broader appeal and representation across different regions. This requirement ensures that the elected president is more likely to be a unifying leader, taking into account the interests of various regions and avoiding an overly partisan presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College directs campaign efforts towards swing states, as stated by Judge Posner. The winner-take-all nature of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus on states where the outcome is uncertain and where voters, by extension, pay closer attention to the campaigns. This focus ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, ultimately decide the election. This approach also prevents small pockets of the population from wielding disproportionate influence in a purely popular vote system.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance between large and small states, as argued by Judge Posner. In the United States, large states already have reduced representation in the Senate due to the constitutional mal-apportionment. The Electoral College provides an opportunity for presidential candidates to pay attention to large states with larger populations, ensuring their concerns and issues are not overlooked. This balance ensures that presidential candidates have a more well-rounded understanding of the diverse needs and interests of different states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner, as emphasized by Judge Posner. Run-off elections can be costly and cumbersome, leading to prolonged uncertainty and further polarization. The Electoral College system ensures that a majority winner emerges, reducing the need for additional elections and providing a swift and effective process for selecting the president.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system plays a vital role in the American democratic process. Its unique structure provides certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. Each of these aspects contributes to a fair and efficient election process, ensuring the selection of a president who represents the diverse interests of the nation as a whole.

Thank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will take these points into account when evaluating potential changes to the Electoral College system. Should you require any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

"Dear Senator of Florida, Electoral Colleges are big parts in the presidential elections, but I don't think we should use them anymore, I think we should elect our president by popular vote.

Why should Electoral Colleges not be used anymore? They should'nt be used anymore because as it states in paragraph 10, source 2 that "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Meaning that who you vote for goes through the system and then if all the electors felt like you did the electors would give the votes towards that candidate. But if they didnt feel the same way as the majority of the voters than maybe another candidate would end up with more electoral votes.

Another example is the 2000 elections, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266, it says in source number 2. If the majority of people vote for one person, why does another become President? It doesn seem fair to me, if the people vote for what they want they should get what they asked for.

In the diagram in source 3, it shows the amount of votes each state gets if you look at the difference in the numbers you can see why this is not fair. For example Rhode Island has only 1 vote but California has 55, if the whole state of Rhode Island votes for the same candidate and only 51% of California votes for a Candidate, who do you think the upper hand willgo for? Oh yeah! California's vote. And that goes for a lot of states, half of the country can vote for the same president but they have a small amount of votes and California has 55! Its not fair at all.",0
"Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience increased happiness, improved air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable forms of transportation. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia highlight the positive effects of limiting car usage and exemplify the potential for change.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in overall well-being. In the town of Vauban, Germany, where cars are prohibited in most areas, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars in order to move there. This change has led to a decrease in stress and tension for many individuals. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, says, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This sentiment is echoed by many others who have made the switch to a car-free lifestyle. By reducing the reliance on cars, people experience less traffic, noise, and pollution, leading to an overall improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which have detrimental effects on the planet. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the number rises to 50%. By reducing the number of cars on the road, greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to cleaner air and a healthier environment. This is evident in Paris, where a driving ban was enforced to combat smog pollution. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality.

Limiting car usage also encourages the development of sustainable and alternative modes of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day is organized every year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work on this day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. The success of this initiative has inspired other cities and countries to adopt similar practices. By creating infrastructure that supports walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can reduce their dependency on cars and provide residents with more accessible and environmentally friendly transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It improves overall well-being by reducing stress and tension associated with driving. It also has a positive impact on the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Additionally, it encourages the development of sustainable transportation options. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the benefits of limiting car usage and the potential for positive change in communities around the world. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can create healthier and more sustainable communities for the future.",1
"The Electoral College consists of more cons than pros. The systems that the unprogrammed engineers work on are complicated vast perspectives. When a president gets elected the most voters and does not receive presidency, wouldn't that confuse you. Popular voting is an effective way to give a candidate presidency simply because the people want that candidate to be the one responsible for the United States. The Electoral College needs to change the way it picks its president. Otherwise, the U.S. would be vulnerable to a president that most people completely denied for the other candidate.

The thing with popular voting is that people can get the president they want. When the elections are based on which candidate has the most popular votes, there are no crazy tricks or a hidden trump card. All you have is a candidate that deserves to be the president of the United States. A good example is Al Gore and his presidency crisis. Most voters looked up to him as president. It was only until the quirks of the electoral college stole his opportunity of becoming president thanks to the system of the electoral college we have today. The situation that makes this crisis even worse is how the voters for the actual electors themselves cannot control whether they win the election or lose. This means that if we keep the routine of the electoral college we have now, there are many opportunities for an unwanted elector. Therefore, leading to an unwanted president.

Ever since 2000, many people have been suffering from economics and industry. This is the simple result of a bad electoral college system. The people of course should have most of the perks in picking a president. If the president is bad at his job in making the U.S. habitable, then the electors are to blame for making a huge mistake. Many doors are opened to sudden changes and confusing decisions. John F. Kennedy could've lost his position since all of the votes didn't necessarily go to him. There's a valid reason why people vote for a candidate. To pick the president they know suits them best.

I will admit to this though. Popular voting is not the accurate way to go through with. I mean there are situations where people just pick a president because he looks professional. Others are simply racist and go for the white candidate or even viseversa. Popular voting is not perfect in the sense of the psychological opinions of the voters themselves. Besides, all of the people living in american soil are different minded. There is literally no way to immediately recognize who the voter is and why his reasons for voting are wrong. There is also nothing we can do since people are allowed to vote for whatever reasons they want.

Due to all of the information given to me about Al Gore and unwanted electors, it is the best solution to change the system to popular voting. Both sides of the arguments have strong reasons to either keep their system or change the way the electoral college is run. Meanwhile, lets be honest. There have been more political downfall with the system we have now that can be fixed with popular voting. Even though there are people that vote for selfish and unreliable reasons, there is still a balance of the people who want this president and the people who don't. The U.S. is consisted of minds that think completely different in the sense of human nature. We don't live in a utopia where everyone agrees with eachother. Now, being able to let the U.S.",0
"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral college , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the RunOff Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most appalling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family. People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for.

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much. In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""source 3. Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote. Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are voting for.Thats why the Electoral College shouldn be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake.

RunOff elections , sounds like a tedious process. When RunOff elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process. We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be. People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left. THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" source 2. Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good. Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes. This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president.It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is. The Electoral College is like a helping hand.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to limit car usage in suburban areas. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. By examining the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, it becomes clear that limiting car usage brings numerous advantages. These advantages include reduced pollution levels, improved public health, increased accessibility to public transportation, and a stronger sense of community.

Body Paragraph 1:
One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in pollution levels. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. In Vauban, Germany, where car ownership is limited and alternative modes of transportation are encouraged, 70% of families do not own cars. This has led to cleaner and quieter streets with less air pollution. Similarly, in Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog caused by car emissions. The ban led to a significant decrease in congestion and pollution levels in the city.

Body Paragraph 2:
Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved public health. The passage states that car emissions are a major contributor to air pollution, which can have detrimental effects on human health. By reducing car usage, cities like Vauban and Paris have created healthier environments for their residents. Walking, biking, and using public transportation as alternatives to driving promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Additionally, reducing car usage can decrease the number of accidents and fatalities on the roads, further improving public health and safety.

Body Paragraph 3:
Limiting car usage also increases accessibility to public transportation. In Vauban, for example, residents have access to a tram that runs to downtown Freiburg. This allows for easy and convenient travel without the need for individual car ownership. Similarly, in Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation options such as buses and taxis. By prioritizing public transportation, these communities are able to provide affordable and efficient options for residents, reducing traffic congestion and improving overall mobility.

Body Paragraph 4:
In addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage fosters a stronger sense of community. In the passage, it is mentioned that Vauban's streets are car-free, creating a peaceful and pedestrian-friendly atmosphere. This encourages social interaction and a sense of belonging among residents. Similarly, in Bogota, car-free days have become a popular event that brings millions of people together and allows them to explore their city in a unique way. By reducing the dominance of cars in the community, individuals have the opportunity to connect with their neighbors, support local businesses, and create a more inclusive and vibrant community.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage brings a multitude of advantages, including reduced pollution levels, improved public health, increased accessibility to public transportation, and a stronger sense of community. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impact of smart planning and the shift towards a more sustainable and people-centric approach to transportation. As society becomes increasingly aware of the environmental and health implications of car usage, it is crucial that we continue to prioritize alternatives and limit our reliance on cars for the benefit of future generations.",1
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method for selecting the President of the United States. While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several benefits that should be considered.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. In the rare cases where there is a dispute over the outcome, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This helps to prevent prolonged disputes and uncertainty, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, because electoral votes are awarded on a winner-take-all basis in most states, even a slight plurality in a state can create a landslide victory. This system, though imperfect, provides a clear and decisive result.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes a president with trans-regional appeal. Regional favorites are unlikely to be successful if they only have support in one specific area. As a result, candidates are motivated to campaign in different regions and consider the interests of voters across the country. This is important for fostering unity and ensuring that the president represents the entire nation, rather than just specific regions.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to focus their efforts on swing states. These states, where the outcome is uncertain, receive more attention and resources during the campaign. This means that voters in these states are more likely to be engaged and informed, as their votes could swing the election. This helps to ensure that the most thoughtful voters have a say in the outcome.

The Electoral College also provides some balance for large states in the political process. While the population of a state determines its number of electors, the system still allows smaller states to have a proportional say in the election. This helps to prevent a situation where large states dominate the election and smaller states are ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. In these cases, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, preventing further complications in the election process. This helps to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the electoral system.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can discourage voter turnout in solidly red or blue states, it is important to note that voter turnout is driven by people wanting to express their political preferences, rather than the belief that their votes may swing a national election. In fact, approximately half of eligible Americans voted in the 2012 election, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not have a decisive impact.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has stood the test of time and provides several key benefits. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages attention to swing states, balances the political weight of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and effective method for choosing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your consideration.

"Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of the benefits of reducing car dependency, including decreased greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life in terms of reduced stress and better community connections.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of these emissions, with Europe and some areas in the United States having car-intensive regions where cars contribute up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, we can directly address this issue and help combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage about Paris's driving ban due to smog highlights the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment and public health. Cold nights and warm days trap car emissions, leading to intensified smog. By reducing car usage, we can minimize the release of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone.

In addition to environmental advantages, limiting car usage can also enhance individual well-being. By relying less on cars, people can engage in more active forms of transportation like walking and cycling, leading to improved physical fitness and overall health. The excerpt from Vauban, Germany, demonstrates how residents who have given up their cars experience less stress and increased happiness. Walking and biking instead of driving can also create a sense of community as people interact with each other more frequently, fostering a stronger social connection.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to smarter urban planning and more accessible public transportation. The passages mention the trend of separating suburban life from auto use, with the development of car-free communities and the placement of stores within walking distance. This approach allows for more compact and efficient living, reducing the need for large parking areas and promoting the use of public transportation. By designing communities that prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, we can create more sustainable and livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, enhancement of individual well-being, and promotion of smarter urban planning. As these passages indicate, many cities and communities are already adopting measures to reduce car dependency and create more sustainable environments. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and rethinking our car culture, we can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future.",1

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While many argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several essential advantages that make it an integral part of our democratic process.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In our current system, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This feature helps to prevent disputes over the results of the election, which would be more likely under a popular vote system. As demonstrated by the 2000 election, even a small plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral vote victory. Additionally, the rare possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote further ensures a clear winner, avoiding any potential complications that would arise in a run-off election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the concept of ""everyone's president."" Since no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must have trans-regional appeal. Consequently, they are compelled to campaign in all states, not just the ones they are likely to win. This not only ensures that a president will have a broad base of support, but also prevents the residents of certain regions from feeling disenfranchised and ignored.

The existence of swing states is another advantage of the Electoral College. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes forces candidates to devote significant campaign efforts to these states. This focus on swing states encourages thorough voter engagement, as citizens in these states become the most thoughtful voters who shape the outcome of the election. Conversely, under a popular vote system, candidates would primarily focus their efforts on large population centers, neglecting the concerns and interests of less populous regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College grants large states the appropriate political weight. By awarding electoral votes based on population size, the Electoral College balances out the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Without the Electoral College, smaller states would receive disproportionately less attention from presidential candidates, who would primarily focus on densely populated areas. This balancing effect allows for a more equitable representation of all states and their diverse interests.

Lastly, it is important to consider that the popular vote does not guarantee a representative outcome for all voters. Swing voters in non-competitive states, such as Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California, may feel disenfranchised and demotivated to participate in the election. However, the historical voter turnout data contradicts this argument, demonstrating that voters participate to express their political preference, regardless of the probability of their vote single-handedly determining the outcome of the election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a time-honored institution that ensures a fair and representative electoral process. Its advantages, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balanced representation for large states, and avoidance of run-off elections, make it a critical component of our democratic system. While there may be justified concerns and calls for reform, any proposed changes should carefully weigh the potential consequences and unintended effects on our collective democracy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take into account the important points raised in this letter when considering any potential reforms to the Electoral College. 

Sincerely,

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College or Changing to Election by Popular Vote

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to you today to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is crucial in maintaining the stability and legitimacy of the presidency.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes unity and trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner points out, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This requires candidates to campaign and appeal to voters in various regions across the country. Ensuring that candidates have broad support across the nation helps to prevent the development of presidents with only regional appeal. It also ensures that all Americans can feel represented and that the new president will have regard for their interests.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This gives more weight to the votes of citizens living in these states and encourages political participation and informed decision-making. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters. By focusing on swing states, candidates must address the concerns and priorities of a diverse range of Americans.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores some balance to political representation by providing additional weight to large states. Judge Posner explains that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives smaller states more representation than their population would suggest. The Electoral College helps to address this imbalance by allocating more attention from presidential candidates to larger states. This ensures that the concerns and needs of voters in larger states are not overshadowed by those in smaller states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This has the potential to complicate the presidential election process and prolong the uncertainty surrounding the outcome. By using the Electoral College, a clear winner is determined, reducing the need for additional elections.

While some argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, these arguments do not hold up when considering the practical benefits it provides. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal and unity, encourages participation in swing states, gives attention to large states, and avoids run-off elections. These factors contribute to the stability, representativeness, and legitimacy of the presidency.

In conclusion, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. The Electoral College has proven to be an effective system that balances the interests of all American citizens and maintains political stability. Thank you for considering my perspective.

"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and societies. It not only helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also promotes healthier and more sustainable living. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the benefits of limiting car usage and the potential for a shift away from car culture.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a study mentioned in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, individuals can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, a car-free community mentioned in one of the passages, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% actually sold their cars to move there. This has led to a significant decrease in emissions in the area.

Limiting car usage also helps to create more sustainable and livable communities. By reducing dependency on cars, cities can become more compact and accessible to public transportation. Vauban serves as an example of this shift, with stores placed within walking distance, rather than in malls along highways. This reduces the need for large parking spaces and encourages people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling. In addition, limiting car usage can promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. In the case of Bogota, Colombia, the city holds a car-free day every year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participate in this event, hiking, biking, or taking buses to work. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also encourages physical activity, leading to better health outcomes for individuals.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of pollution. Congestion in the city decreased by 60%, and while delivery companies complained of lost revenue, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the development of alternative forms of transportation and new business opportunities. For example, car-sharing programs have proliferated across the nation, providing easy access to transportation without the need for individual car ownership.

The decrease in car usage observed in recent years in the United States suggests a shift away from car culture. This cultural shift is influenced by a combination of factors such as the rise of the internet, which enables telecommuting and reduces the need for driving to meet friends. Additionally, the renewal of city centers has made suburbs less appealing and drawn empty nesters back in. The younger generation is also less interested in car ownership, as demonstrated by the decrease in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds obtaining driver's licenses. This shift in behavior not only has positive environmental implications but also presents challenges and opportunities for the car industry.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the creation of more sustainable communities, promotion of healthier lifestyles, and potential economic benefits. Examples from different cities and countries demonstrate the potential for a shift away from car culture and towards more sustainable living. By adopting policies and practices that limit car usage and promote alternative forms of transportation, individuals and societies can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future.",1

Dear [State Senator's name],

I am writing to express my thoughts regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. After considering the information from various sources, including ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained for several compelling reasons.

The first reason to keep the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As Posner explains, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes and provides a clear winner. The winner-take-all system in most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This stability in outcome is crucial for maintaining a strong and confident leadership.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents a broad range of interests by requiring trans-regional appeal. With no single region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates are incentivized to appeal to multiple regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning the Presidency, ensuring that the elected President represents the entire nation and not just a specific region or majority.

Additionally, the swing states in the Electoral College system play a vital role in promoting an engaged and informed electorate. Plumer points out that candidates focus their campaign efforts on swing states, encouraging voters in those states to pay close attention to the campaign and make thoughtful choices. By allowing the most thoughtful voters to decide the election, the Electoral College ensures that the Presidency is in the hands of those who have taken the time to genuinely evaluate the candidates and their policies.

The Electoral College also balances political power between large and small states, addressing the mal-apportionment of the Senate's representation. As Posner highlights, the Electoral College gives proportionate attention to large states in presidential campaigns, encouraging candidates to address the concerns and interests of citizens in those states. This balanced approach prevents unduly focusing on highly populated regions while disregarding the needs and perspectives of smaller states.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the complexities of run-off elections that may occur when no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College upholds the stability and efficiency of the presidential election process, eliminating the need for additional rounds of voting and potential confusion.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, I believe that voter turnout is driven by the desire to express a political preference rather than the expectation of deciding the outcome of the election. As evidenced by the high turnout in previous elections, voters participate in the democratic process to have their voices heard and values represented.

In conclusion, retaining the Electoral College is essential for maintaining certainty, broad representation, an engaged electorate, a balanced distribution of power, and a clear winner in presidential elections. I urge you to consider these reasons and support the continuation of the Electoral College as the method of choosing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities alike. This is evident in the experiences of communities around the world, as described in the passages provided. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address critical issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as create safer and more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in areas where car usage is high. For example, in Europe, cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50 percent (Passage 5). By reducing car usage, we can help combat climate change and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality. In cities like Paris, smog can become a major problem, causing health issues for residents. To combat this, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to reduce smog levels, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion (Passage 10, 14). Similar efforts have been made in other cities, such as Bogota, where car-free days have been implemented to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation (Passage 21).

In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on public health and safety. In communities where cars are restricted, residents are more likely to engage in physical activities like walking or biking, leading to improved fitness levels and overall well-being. Moreover, by reducing car usage, we can create safer streets with fewer accidents and fatalities. In Vauban, Germany, where car usage is limited, residents report feeling happier and less tense without the constant presence of cars (Passage 3).

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more efficient and compact community planning. By reducing the need for parking spaces, communities can allocate more land for other purposes, such as parks or public transportation infrastructure. In Vauban, stores are placed a walk away on a main street, providing residents with easy access to necessities without the need for a car (Passage 6). This type of planning can create more vibrant and accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation over cars.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can address environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health and safety, and create more efficient and sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passages demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and highlight the potential for change in our own communities. It is clear that by prioritizing alternative transportation methods and adopting smart planning strategies, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"Dear State Senator, Many people today have very strong opinions on why or why not we should keep the Electoral College. I am writing to you today to tell you some of the reasons why the Electoral College should not be used anymore.

The Electoral College, like most things, has room for error. However this is the type of error that you want to try as hard as possible to avoid. Any error here could lead to the false election of a President and Vice President. Now maybe the falsely elected President and Vice President have some wonderful ideas on how to help our country as a whole, but in carrying out their wonderful sounding plans, may have to hurt or cut back other resources to do so which could hurt us. This is just one example of how the Electoral College can go wrong.

The Electoral College has been used for many years and has become an anachronism. We consider ourselves a democracy yet we use a nondemocratic method of selecting a president. With the Electoral College comes the certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of hisher Electoral College usually exceeds the share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires the president to be a candidate with a transregional appeal. Any candidate with regional appeal is very unlikely to be successful as president. The residents of the other regions will most likely feel disenfranchised and that this candidate is not really their president. The swing states tend to pay closer attention to the campaigns and to really listen to what the competing candidates have to say. The residents in the swing states tend to be the most thoughtful voters. In the Electoral College, they try to restore a political balance between the large and the small states. With the Electoral College you avoid the problem of an election where no candidate recieves a majority vote which would complicate the presedential election process.

All of these reasons are great and everything but there is always going to be a flaw in the system. Some believe that is is the people who vote in the presidents, however, all we are doing is electing the slate of electors who are are the real people who elect the president. In the Electoral College there is a disaster factor. The electors chosen could always defy the will of the people. These electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for and some voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The most worrying part though is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If a tie were to happen, the election would be thrown off to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations would vote on the president. Due to the fact that each state casts only one vote, one single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have just as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who are representing 35 million voters. The House's selection can hardly be expected to refelct the will of the peple in the states. The elections can be only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters in its most basic level. Due to the winnertakeall system that is in place in each state, the candidates don't spend as much time if any at all in the states they know they have no chance of winning, and spend most of if not all of their time on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Like everything it would take some timw to get used to the changes and I understand that. I also understand that election by popular vote has its flaws as well. It is time to change from an outdates, irrational, and unfair method. Thank you for your time and consideration about this. I hope you consider changing from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.",0
"  A Vision of Sustainable Urban Living  In an era marked by rapid urbanization and environmental concerns, the concept of car-free cities is gaining traction as an innovative approach to address the multifaceted challenges of urban living. Car-free cities propose a transformation where private automobiles are either heavily restricted or entirely absent, paving the way for sustainable transportation alternatives and a greener, more vibrant urban environment.  Car-free cities represent a visionary shift in urban living, emphasizing sustainability, public health, and community well-being. They offer a glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment, but transitioning to this model is not without its unique set of challenges.  One of the primary benefits of car-free cities lies in their potential to significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist safety, these cities aim to reduce accidents and improve public health, leading to better respiratory and cardiovascular well-being for urban residents. These cities make efficient use of urban space, repurposing parking lots and wide roads into green parks, recreational areas, and pedestrian zones. This transformation rejuvenates the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents.  Traffic congestion, a common urban woe, is notably reduced in car-free cities, resulting in shorter commutes and a more peaceful daily urban experience for residents and commuters. Additionally, the financial burden of car ownership is lightened as residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses.  However, transitioning to car-free cities presents a unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. Redesigning urban areas for car-free living is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring comprehensive planning and significant investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer an inspiring vision of a more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban future. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a compelling goal. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation. Car-free cities represent a hopeful glimpse of a more sustainable and people-centric urban environment.",1

"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and the environment. As the passages suggest, there is a global movement towards separating suburban life from auto use, as part of a larger effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life in communities.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can make a meaningful impact on reducing these harmful pollutants. For example, in Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By adopting car-free or low-car lifestyles, like in the German suburb of Vauban, we can make a positive change in the environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality, especially in heavily polluted areas. Cities like Paris have implemented partial driving bans to combat smog and have seen congestion decrease and air quality improve. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, creating healthier and cleaner environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By designing suburbs with smart planning in mind, like placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, we can create more compact and efficient communities. This not only reduces the reliance on cars but also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles. As seen in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participate in a car-free day each year, car-free initiatives can generate a revolutionary change in how we view transportation and urban development.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The reduction in the number of vehicles on the road can alleviate traffic congestion, leading to faster commute times and increased productivity. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs. Instead of investing in personal vehicles, people can redirect their resources towards public transit systems and other means of transportation that benefit the entire community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating sustainable communities, and providing economic benefits. As we move towards a more environmentally conscious and sustainable future, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation and promote car-free or low-car lifestyles. By doing so, we can create healthier, cleaner, and more accessible communities for everyone.",1
"Essay:

Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various parts of the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are significant and include improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and greater reliance on public transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the environmental benefit it brings. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars alone account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease the amount of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere, thus helping to combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. This is evident in the case of Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a significant reduction in air pollution. Similarly, the city of Bogota in Colombia implemented a car-free day, which led to the streets being devoid of traffic jams and reduced smog levels. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for both current and future generations.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities around the world, traffic congestion is a major problem that causes frustration and wastes valuable time. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can alleviate traffic congestion and improve the overall flow of traffic. This is exemplified in German suburb Vauban, where giving up cars is the norm. The result is car-free streets and a peaceful atmosphere where bicycles and pedestrians have precedence. By limiting car usage, we can create more efficient and less congested roadways.

Limiting car usage also promotes greater reliance on public transportation. When suburbs are designed with the concept of smart planning in mind, they are made more compact and accessible to public transportation. Stores are placed within walking distance, and amenities are located on main streets instead of distant malls. This approach encourages people to use public transportation instead of relying solely on personal vehicles. It also makes public transportation a more attractive and convenient option for daily commuting. The success of this approach is evident in Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars and public transportation is readily available.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and significant. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote the use of public transportation. This not only benefits the environment but also enhances the overall quality of life for residents. It is clear that limiting car usage is an essential step towards creating sustainable and livable communities.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Living in a society that heavily relies on cars for transportation has its drawbacks. However, there are several advantages to limiting car usage that can benefit individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can alleviate issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, and pollution, while also promoting healthier and more sustainable forms of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution and global warming. According to a study, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make substantial progress in tackling this issue.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. In cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban was enforced due to smog, the congestion reduced by 60 percent (Duffer). This decrease in traffic not only reduces travel time for individuals, but it also contributes to a more efficient and productive transportation system overall.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. The smog and pollution caused by car emissions have detrimental effects on human health. By adopting car-free initiatives like the one implemented in Bogota, where millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took public transportation instead of driving, we can reduce air pollution and create a healthier living environment (Selsky). This can lead to a decrease in respiratory diseases and other health problems caused by poor air quality.

Limiting car usage also promotes the use of alternative and sustainable forms of transportation. In some car-reduced communities, stores and amenities are placed within walking distance or easily accessible by public transportation (Rosenthal). This encourages individuals to rely less on cars and instead use modes of transportation that are better for their health and the environment. Walking, biking, and taking public transportation have numerous benefits, including increased physical activity, less fuel consumption, and reduced traffic congestion.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote healthier and more sustainable forms of transportation. It is crucial for individuals and communities to embrace these initiatives to create a greener and more livable future for all.",1
"For more than a hundred years now, we have been relying on automobiles for many things. Since the beginning, we've seen a tremendous increase due to the more factories built and more company founded to create different versions and models of cars. We use them to go place to place. However, it does have its downfall. The majority of pollution caused by cars driven around the entire planet is caused by the emissions released from the car itself. Obviously that's nowhere near healthy so why not try limiting the car usage?

Many places round the world have already begun trying little projects inorder to cut back on smog or pollution. In Vauban, Germany, for example, a tremendous amount of people don't own cars. According to the excerpt from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it mentions how 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold one to move there. The streets are completely carfree minus the main thoroughfare where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs. All of this turned into a growing trend throughout Europe to separate suburban life from car usage. It's referred to as ""smart planning"". Experts say these changes are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Another positive effect of this experiment, stores are placed a walk away, on a main straight, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Think about living in an environment where you can actually breathe in the fresh air and not choke on it thanks to the smell of exhaust fumes coming from all of the automobiles contesting the streets and cities you'd like to walk in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is reducing stress and tension caused by driving. In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians either hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during their ""carfree day"", according to the excerpt from ""CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. The only permitted automobiles are buses and taxis during those days. The goal of the entire event is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Anyone who violated the program would face a 25 fine. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife."" During one of the years, two more cities from the country joined. Due to event, it improved a campaign which began in the mid1990s where there's been a construction of 118 miles of bycicle path which is the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus who is the city's mayor. Another positive result of this project was the blooming of parks and sport centers throughout the city. Even the uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced, rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut the amount of traffic and new restaurants have cropped up. It was as if the entire city itself was reinovated thanks to their CarFree Day.

Considering the fact that transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions according to the excerpt from ""The End of Car Culture"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it's not a bad idea limiting car usage. At the end of the day, we have more advantages than anything else. Those include reducing the amount of smog and pollution caused by the automobiles' emissions and reducing stress plus the tension while drivng. Again, who wouldn't want to be able to walk around town enjoying the outside beautiful environment nature provides us with, without having to hold their breath everytime a car or truck passes by with their nasty exhaust fumes? Make the world a better place to live in.",0

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and advocate against the idea of changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College plays a crucial role in maintaining our democratic process and upholding the principles on which our founding fathers established this nation.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. With the winner-take-all system, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, providing a clear and decisive outcome. As witnessed in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. This system minimizes the likelihood of a disputed election and provides a stable framework for the American people.

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is that it ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This forces candidates to campaign across the nation, appealing to voters from different backgrounds and perspectives. It ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to win the presidency and that all Americans feel represented in the highest office.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This system gives a voice to the most thoughtful voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and neglecting the concerns and issues of smaller states.

The Electoral College also balances the political power between large and small states. The system restores weight to large states that may otherwise lose their influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. For instance, in the 2012 election, Florida, with its close popular vote, received 29 electoral votes, while a comparable victory in Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. This balance allows candidates to address the concerns of both small and large states, ensuring a more equitable representation of the American people.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate secures a majority in the popular vote, the Electoral College guarantees the selection of a clear winner. Run-off elections would complicate the presidential election process and may lead to further division among the electorate. The Electoral College acts as a safeguard to ensure a definite outcome and avoid prolonged electoral disputes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic process. It facilitates certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all regions and states, encourages candidates to campaign widely, balances the political power between large and small states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, it is essential to remember that the Electoral College has served us well for over two centuries and maintains the integrity of our elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective. I trust that you will carefully weigh the advantages of the Electoral College in making decisions regarding this matter. I am confident that upholding the Electoral College will ensure a fair and representative election process for future generations of Americans.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
